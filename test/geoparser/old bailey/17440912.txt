The Churchwarden said the Coroner obliged him to prosecute , and I appear for the parish . Edmund Kelleck , Surgeon . I live in Great Russel-Street ; I was sent for to the deceased three days after he was dead to open the body , and found a vast quantity of blood in the cavity of the abdomen , which I believe proceeded from an eruption of one of the blood vessels , for there were no wounds upon him ; and this must from the shock of the fall : there was one of the capital vessels in the cavity of the abdomen , and the body was quite in a diseased state before this accident . I opened the skull in order to see if there was any contusion upon the brain , but found it clear and safe . One lobe of the lungs was quite adhered to the pleura and was quite emaciated ( but that was not occasioned by this fall ) and there was a little adhesion of the other lobe , but not like that .

Q . Who knocked you over the head with a stick ? Hobdell . One of the little fellows . Q . Did the Prisoner take the cane from you ? Hobdell . I can not say he did : I struggled for my cane because it was a cane that I valued , and if the watch had not come to my assistance , I verily believe I should have been murdered . - I ca n't say the Prisoner did any thing to me ; the watchman pursued them , and I followed the watchman , but only the Prisoner was taken : then he said he had got into bad company , and did not know they were going upon that work .

I got up upon my legs and pulled out 9 s. 9 d. ( for I had just before received 9 s. 9 d. at the Civet Cat in the Strand , ) and paid 3 d. for the pot of beer .

Q . Did not the waterman seize them ? Thorn . No , he did not ; he pulled them away [ rowed away ] as fast as he could . I took a boat and rowed after them - There were some lighters a little way off , and some boats faitened to them , and I took one of them and rowed after them . When they came on shore I jumped upon a lighter , got on shore and took hold of the Prisoner and kept her . - I could not take them all for I had not a Constable ? Q . Did you find any thing upon her ? Thorn . I did not examine her as to that ; the Justice asked me whether I could swear to the money in my pocket ? I said , I could not ; but it was small silver - I believe the Prisoner took it because she was by me . Q . They were all three by you , why might not one of the others take it ? Thorn . The other two did not come near me after the money was lost . Q . Which side of the table did the other women sit on ? Thorn . They sat on the off side of the table . Q . Was the Prisoner near enough to touch you after you pulled out the money to pay the reckoning ? Thorn . Yes , I believe she was . Q . Had not you the other two women in custody as well as this ? Thorn . After I got on shore I had them all three in custody . Q . Why did not you keep them ? Thorn . Because I could not . Prisoner . Did not I go voluntarily with you before the Justice ? Thorn . I ca n't say you did voluntarily , because we laid hold of you . Q . Who is we ? Thorn . There were some others took my part , that they did not mob me off . Jury .

I had got the broomstick in my hand , and I said I would knock his brains out if he offered to move , and then the money fell down - I do n't know how much : then he pretty artfully catched hold of me and threw me over the rails into the road , but we both tumbled over together . Bucklimes was looking for the money : I still held Roach by the collar , and Bucklimes seeing I had managed him , held this stick up and said , G - d - your eyes , if you do n't let him go , I 'll knock your brains out ; when I had him down I cried out murder , and in some little time the watch came .

I ask you whether you did not say at the Justice 's that the watch was lost on a Sunday ? Matthews . I was in a fluster , and happened to drop that word . Q . If you lost your watch at twelve at noon , and was at the Justice 's at four that afternoon , could not you tell whether you lost it that day or the day before ? Matthews . I happened when I was asked the question when I lost it , to drop these words , it was yesterday Robert Poulson . When the Prisoner was at the Constable 's house , she said she believed she could help him to it again for half a guinea . Q . Did he swear before the Justice that he lost it on a Sunday ? Poulson .

All these people that swear against me lodge in this particular room : I am a market woman and keep a house to let out ready furnished lodgings , all these witnesses that are against me get their living by nothing but wickedness , these creatures that the Prosecutor has hired and kept these three or four days are to take my life away . Ann Mozeen . ( Mr. Newman 's coat was shewn to her : and she was asked whether she knew it ) . I know no more than that this young woman brought this coat in - I know her no otherwise than by the name of Jenny - I think they call her Jenny Smack . Jenny Smack called again .

Last Wednesday sennight I was in the kitchen backwards , and was surprized with a very great noise ; I thought the servants had been fighting : I went into the shop and they were very quiet ; the maid went a little way up stairs and came down very much frightened , for she saw her mistress 's cloaths scattered about the stairs . I happened to look up and saw the sash up two pair of stairs lifted up , and the Prisoner look out of the window ; I cried out Thieves directly , and she made the best of her way down stairs to get out of the house ; but one of my servants seized her coming down stairs ; she fell down on her knees , begged we would forgive her and said she would never do so any more ; I believe she had loaded herself too much and made a false step and so tumbled down stairs . Guilty 39 s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 391 . + Thomas James , of the Parish of St. Mary Lebon , was indicted for the murder of William Corryndon , by striking him with a stick on the nose , on the 3d day of May last , and thereby giving him a mortal bruise , of which he languished from the said 3d day of May to the 20th day of the same month in the Parish of Mary Lestrand , and then died . He was a second time charged on the Coroner 's inquest for feloniously slaying the said William Corryndon . John Smart . As I was at work in a brick field , I heard a noise of men quarreling for upwards of a quarter of an hour ; I left off work and went into the brick field where they were and went up within six yards of them ; and there stood the Deceased , and the Prisoner came up to him ; the Deceased said what is it you would have ? And the Prisoner said what do you want with me , sirrah ? What do you mean by abusing me in this manner ? Upon that the deceased asked him if he would fight him : fight you , says the Prisoner , what should I fight you for ? you fight me ! Says the deceased , fight you , aye , but wo n't you take the Law of me ? the Prisoner said to the deceased , I take the Law of you , what should I take the Law of you for ? with that the deceased struck the Prisoner or struck at him - I ca n't tell whether he struck him , but he struck at him ; - they had each of them sticks . ( The stick the Prisoner had was produced , which was a small bamboo cane with a crook Ivory head , part of which was broke off . ) After he had struck at the Prisoner , the Prisoner struck at him again ; and after several blows had passed on both sides , the Prisoner laid hold of the deceased and threw him down with his face upon the ground ; his face was very bloody and the blood run down very sadly between his Eyes . After he was down the Prisoner beat him with his stick several times , and broke his stick upon him . Then a person took him up , but the Prisoner being stronger than he drove him four or five yards , and he fell down flat upon his back in a cart rut ; and then the Prisoner went to strike at him again , though I do n't know that he struck him any more , but the deceased lay in a dismal condition ; for I believe he was in liquor , and what between that and the blows he could not stir himself . Q . Did not you observe the deceased turn from the Prisoner , and then the Prisoner follow him and strike at him . Smart . I did not see that - the deceased had the biggest stick . Q . Did not you observe that when the deceased was down , the Prisoner continued to strike him over the back and reins ? Smart . Yes , and I asked whether he was going to murder the man , and the people said the deceased began first ; I said if he did begin first he ought not to be murdered . Sparham , Surgeon . On the 16 or 17 of May , I was sent for to the deceased , which was thirteen days , as I was informed , after he had received an injury by Mr. James the Quaker ; there was a wound upon his nose , which upon searching I found was almost healed up by his own applications , and I found his under jaw contracted close ; his swallowing prevented almost entirely ; he could not go to stool and could hardly make water . I examined his head to see if he had received any wound there ; there was no fracture , and I could not perceive any wound except that in his nose : I did something to relax the jaw and to make him evacuate ; but in about three days he died : the upper part of the bone of the nose was bruised , upon which I put my probe into the outward membrane or covering of the bone , and the probe came through into the roof of his mouth , and by the simpathy between one membrane and another , this bruise occasioned the contraction of the jaw , so that it is my opinion the man died of a penury or a perfect starving . Q . Did you ever know an instance of this nature before ? Sparham . Yes , two or three times ; but 't is very rare , I saw it once in a carman ; that such a contraction was occasioned by the bruise of one of his fingers . It is my opinion this contraction occasioned the want of swallowing and going to stool , and that this contraction was occasioned by this blow . Jury . Mr. Sparham , if you had been sent for at first might not this have been prevented ? Sparham . I believe if I had been sent for I should have laid it open , and that would have relieved the membrane . The Jury brought in their verdict , that the Prisoner did it in his own defence . 392 . + Mary Picket , of St. Vedast Foster , was indicted for stealing a linen handkerchief , value 18 d. the goods of Simon Oncly , privately from his person , July 19th .

I saw a watchman , and asked him if that was the way to the water-side ? He said it was not , and drove the Prisoner out before him . I put my hand into my pocket and missed my handkerchief , and found it under her arm holes in the watch-house - I am a Gardener , I live at Rotherbith . Prisoner .

They were separately wrapped up in a piece of brown paper ; I missed them September the 3d , and saw them there a week before - I suspected the Prisoner because there was nobody else in the room , and when she came to lodge with me she was very poor and mean , and could not pay for washing or lodging .

William Hall . On the 3d of this month about eight o'clock in the evening , I was coming from Edmonton to London in a hackney coach - There were also in the coach Mrs. Pickersgill and a child of her 's , Mr. Gretton , and Mr. Podger . On the other side of Islington fronting a lane they call Frog-Lane , MackEvoy ( for I know his face very well ) - I am sure he is the person , came up to the coach first , he held a pistol in his hand and pointed it to me and said , D - n your eyes , the soul that speaks a word I will blow their brains out , or words to that purport : he repeated those words twice , and bid us deliver our watches and money . I sat some little time , and found means to secrete my watch under the cushion of the coach ; when I had done that , I desired he would use us civilly and he should have what we had ; then he made use of another oath , and bid us come out of the coach . - There were two others with him . Q . Do you know the other Prisoner ? Hall . I was very cautious of looking too much at them , for fear they should think I was drawing their pictures as they call it . I came out of the coach , MackEvoy rifled my pockets , turned them inside out , and took out 4 s. 6 d. or 5 s. 6 d. and half a guinea , a bone perfume box , a tin tobacco box and a knife ; when they had rifled my pockets so far , I was left by myself ; presently the same man [ MackEvoy ] catches off one sleeve of my coat which came pretty easily off ; then came another and pulled off the other sleeve , and he that pulled off the last sleeve took the coat away , and instantly as the sleeve of my coat was pulled off , my hat and wig were pulled off behind me , but I can not tell who took them ; there was a linen handkerchief taken with my coat it being in the pocket . Q . Considering it was eight o'clock at night , how could you see MackEvoy so as to distinguish him ? Hall . The moon shone , and I had so much reason to remark him , for he was the first man that came up to the coach , and as I was secreting my watch , I looked pretty much in his face to see whether he observed my motion about the watch . He has a very remarkable face , and his voice is as remarkable - After they had robbed me they took the other gentlemen out of the coach and robbed them , and then went up Frog-Lane - They were all on foot . Q . Had MackEvoy a cutlass ? Hall . I saw two cutlasses , but I do n't know whether MackEvoy had any or not . Q . Did they do any thing with their cutlasses ? Hall . They cut one gentleman who was in the coach . Q . When were they taken up afterwards ? Hall . They were taken up by an accident . Capt . Dodd at the Savoy sent a letter concerning them : I saw them before Justice Fraser , and knew MackEvoy directly . Q . Was there any thing taken upon them ? Hall . There was a trunk taken upon them , and in that trunk were several things that were stole . - I had nothing back again but this bone perfume box , which I ca n't tell whether I took out of the trunk , or off the table at the Justice 's . MackEvoy . Pray , Sir , what clothes had I on then ? Hall . I can not tell . MackEvoy . What dress was I in ? Hall . You had a cap or a handkerchief tied about your head , I can not tell which . MackEvoy . Tis a strange case that a man should distinguish a man 's face , when he could not tell whether he had a cap or a handkerchief on . Was the handkerchief down upon my face or no ? Hall . It was not down over your face , it was in the nature of a cap . MackEvoy . Can a man have a handkerchief upon his head without its covering his face ? Hall . Yes , very easily . William Cowland . I was the coachman , and Abraham Carter was along with me upon the coach box ; I saw a man come up and he said to me , D - n your eyes stop , or I 'll blow your brains out this minute , six or seven times over , ( one came a little before the other , and before he stopped the coach , another came to the coach door ) upon his saying these words I stopped ; the first man demanded Carter off the box , and then demanded his watch and money , and robbed him . Henry Gretton . I was in the coach with Mr. Hall , and saw a person come up to the coach with a pistol in his hand : I ca n't swear positively , but I verily believe MackEvoy is the person , he had ( as Mr. Hall says ) a cap or a handkerchief upon his head , but not a wig : he used the same expression as Mr. Hall says ; when he put the pistol into the coach I endeavoured to secrete something as Mr. Hall did . After he had taken Mr. Hall 's money , they took him out of the coach ; then I saw two persons about him , and saw them very busy about his pockets - Rifling them . Q . You say to the best of your remembrance that MackEvoy was one , can you say any thing to Ryley ? Gretton . I said I believed it was MackEvoy ; and I think the same of , Ryley , I have the same idea of both of them , but I ca n't positively swear to them : the moon was in and out , and the moon glistened against the pistol . Q . Did you see ever another person there ? Gretton . Yes , I thought there were four persons in the robbery , I thought so all along ; and Mr. Hall said then that he should know one of them . - Ryley had his hat flapped , and I think a dark wig on as he has now . MackEvoy . Should you know me to be the person , if you were to meet me at any part of the town ? Hall . I really should , for I looked full in your face , and remember it particularly well . Joshua Pickersgill . I was behind the coach : at the end of Frog-Lane I saw three men ; one came up to the horse 's heads , and the other to the coach side , and bid the people in the coach deliver their watches and money , and he that was at the horse 's heads said he would blow their brains out - The first thing I saw them do was taking Mr. Hall out of the coach , and then they rifled him and took his coat , and after they had stripped him of his coat , one of them took off his hat and wig behind him - I believe the Prisoners are the men , they were about their bulk and stature , but I can not swear to their faces . I heard Mr. Hall say at the Justice 's , that he could swear to MackEvoy . MackEvoy . Are there not other persons of my size and stature ? Pickersgill . There may be so , but I verily believe you are the man . MackEvoy . How many came up to you ? Pickersgill . There were three . MackEvoy . The other gentleman says there were four . Pickersgill . I am sure there were three , there might be more ; they came rushing from the end of the lane up to the coach . Captain Anthony Dodd . On Friday night last about five o'clock , MackEvoy came to me with a warrant signed by Justice Fraser , to demand one Patrick Askin out of the Savoy , who was a pressed man from the city : he had sworn before the Justice , that Patrick Askin had picked his pocket in the Savoy of 9 s. 2 d. I thought there was something more than ordinary in the case , and did not believe that he had picked his pocket . I went to Justice Fraser 's , and came back again with a design to make an enquiry into it ; one Mr. Morris came , and said he wanted to speak with Patrick Askin : he said there was a trunk left at his house and he could not open it for want of the key . I told Patrick Askin the mistrust we had , and then he desired to become an evidence , so we took his information : upon which we went between one and two in the morning , to Mr. Maddoxs 's at the Two Chairmen in Drury-Lane , and took Mr. Ryley in bed ; MackEvoy jumped out of the window , but he was taken before he could get off . I happened to hear the sash go , or else they would both have got out of the window , and probably have got off . Then we carried them to New-Prison in a coach my own three men , and Mr. Edwards and I went in the coach with them . Q . Where did you find the trunk ? Captain Dodd . I sent one of my men for it to Mr. Morris 's at the King's-Arms in Bishopsgate church-yard . Q . Do you know whether they owned the trunk ? Captain Dodd . They did not - They did not confess any thing to me . Prisoner Ryley . Askin said the trunk belonged to himself . Captain Dodd . I wondered when MackEvoy wanted to take a man out for 9 s. 2 d. that there were four pounds given for : then I thought that some Irish men had a mind to rob us of all our men , and I bid him go out of the Savoy ; he said he lived in Duke-Street , and that he was a gentleman of a great fortune . MackEvoy . Why do you think 't is an odd thing that I should demand a man that had robbed me of 9 s. 2 d. tell me upon your oath ? Capt . Dodd . You had the 9 s. 2 d. again . MackEvoy . Stay , I have more questions to ask you , was it Ryley or I that jumped out of the window ? Captain Dodd . You were the man that was taken naked in the yard . John Edwards . I was at the taking of Ryley and MackEvoy , at the Two Chairmen in Drury-Lane : MackEvoy jumped out of the window ; after we had taken Ryley I had him below stairs in a box , and he desired to know whether he might not be admitted an evidence , and said if he could , he would confess every thing : I asked him whether he was at the robbing of Alderman Heathcote , and he said he was not : I asked him as to the robbing the coach by Frog-Lane , and I think he seemed to consent that he was there . Ryley . Did not you tell me that my Evidence would go before Askin 's , and desired if I knew any thing to tell you , and I told you I would tell all I knew ? Edwards . I do n't remember I said your Evidence would go before Askin 's , you asked if you could any ways be admitted an Evidence , and if you could be admitted an Evidence you would tell the whole . I said I did not know but you might . Patrick Askin . That night , Luke Ryley , John MackEvoy , and myself met at the Pyed Bull in Whitecross Street , we went out and robbed some Gentlemen in the fields , then we went into Frog Lane and robbed a coach . Q . Who went up to the coach first ? Askin . I went up to the coach first , and robbed the coachman [ Cowland ] and the other man that was with him . Q . Who went up to the coach door first ? Askin . John MackEvoy . Q . What did he do ? Askin . I do n't know . Q . What was Ryley doing ? Askin . I do n't know . Q . Were there three or four of you ? Askin . There were three of us - I was concerned in several other robberies - about twenty or thirty , I believe fifteen or sixteen of them have been committed in about six weeks last past . Q . Would you ask him any questions ? Prisoner Ryley . I think it in vain to ask him any . MackEvoy . We can prove him to be a vagabond and a vile fellow . Askin . I have known Ryley about six weeks and MackEvoy about five months - We have been about five months in committing all these robberies . Q . Have you been promised any reward to be an Evidence ? Askin . There have been no promises made me - I did it voluntarily , to save my life . Q . Has there been any promise of pardon ? Askin . No . Prisoner Ryley . Did not Capt . Dodd desire you to turn Evidence ? Askin . Capt . Dodd said he would save my life , he did not promise he would prevent my being a soldier . Q . Was there a trunk found any where ? Askin . Yes , at Mr. Morris 's - I sent it there by a Porter - 't is my trunk . Prisoner Ryley . Did Capt . Dodd say any thing of your having a reward ? Askin . No , he did not say any thing of that . Q . Did you see Mr. Hall at the Justice 's ? Askin . I saw him there . Q . Did he take that little box [ a little bone perfume box ] off the table or out of the trunk ? Askin . I am sure he took it out of the trunk . Jury . Do you remember what was taken from the Gentlemen in the coach ? Askin . I can not remember - I had all the clothes given me - I had a barragon coat . Q . Where did you divide these things ? Askin . At my lodging , at Mr . Frost 's on the other side of the water . John Thomas . I am a Constable of St. Giles 's , on Friday night last between eleven and twelve , Capt . Dodd came with an information from Justice Fraser , to take two highwaymen at the two Chairmen in Drury Lane ; I said it was a very vile house ( for I am afraid of going into that house when I go my rounds . ) However we went into the house , and MackEvoy jumped out of the window in his shirt and a handkerchief about his head ; and the man of the house stood by the door of the room , where they were , in his shirt and said , I should not go into that room . But Capt . Dodd 's men broke open the door , and I took Ryley covered over head and ears in bed , and this hanger was lying by his bed side . I was not careful enough to secure the hanger then , but the woman of the house put it into another room . The landlord had got into bed again , and I said to him , friend , you had better discover the fire-arms . He said there were no fire-arms , but a hanger in a trunk that belonged to Ryley , and we found these three hangers in the trunk . Pris . Ryley . Did I offer to run away or resist in any way ? Thomas . No . MackEvoy . Are you to turn Evidence , or do you design to be an Evidence ? Thomas . I will do any thing at any time in order to discover villainy . MackEvoy . Do you expect any part of the reward ? Thomas . No not I , I do n't want any reward . Edward Frost . I live in Redcross Street in the Park Southwark . Q . Who lodged at your house ? Frost . The Peacher . Q . Call people by their names . Frost . I am not able to think of their names . Last monday was sennight about eleven o'clock at night , Askin came home and the two men at the bar with him - I am sure it was on monday sennight - I am sure the Prisoners are the men , because they had been with him several times before . The manner of their coming was thus ; Askin came to the door first , and said open the door and take away the light . I did not see any thing brought in for they went up in the dark - I knew who they were by their coming down together afterwards . Askin came down asked for a candle and went up again , and I thought I heard them telling of money . They all came down together I believe in about a quarter of an hour , and they all three sat down in a little room we have below and sent for two full pots of beer . After that Ryley took his leave of the other two and went home , and MackEvoy lodged all night with Askin . After these two went up , I having some suspicion that they were something worse than smugglers , as they pretended to be , stepped up stairs , looked through the door , and saw MackEvoy pull off his clothes and put on a scarlet coat . Those two rose about five or six o'clock in the morning and went out , but what they brought in or carried out I do not know . Peter Burchall . I keep Blossoms Inn in Lawrence Lane , last Thursday [ 6th of Sept. ] MackEvoy and another man with him , ( a short thick man ) came to my house and enquired for the Chester waggon , and whether he could not send a box by it . I said the Chester waggon was gone out , but the Liverpool waggon was in the yard and it might go by that ; MackEvoy said that was much the same . Q . Who brought the box ? Burchall . John MackEvoy brought the box . He asked how he could come at the box again at Liverpool : I told him I would give him a note to receive it there , and I gave him a note to receive it of the carrier at Liverpool , and I directed it by his order ; For Mr. John MackEvoy to be left at the Nagshead Inn in Liverpool till called for . MackEvoy . Did I bring a box to your house ? Burchall . You are the person , and you gave me directions how to spell your name ; you said I must make a large ( M ) then ( ack ) a great ( E ) a narrow bottomed ( v ) and ( oy ) . Q . Is this the box that was brought to your house ? Burchall . This is the box , I know it by the direction , and this is the box that was opened at Justice Fraser 's . There were four watches taken out of it , three silver ones and a studded one , and some plate buttons , and there was a little Ivory Box taken out of it [ Mr. Hall 's box ] - I never saw Ryley till now , and I never saw MackEvoy till he brought the box . John Richardson . I was at the taking of the Prisoners . I heard somebody jump out of the window and saw MackEvoy in his shirt ; I took hold of his shirt and it tore . I took hold of him again and said if he did not stop I would shoot him , and then he begged for his life . Luke Ryley was brought down stairs and sat down in a box , and desired to know if he could not be admitted an Evidence . Mr. Edwards told him he did not know but he might if he made a discovery . He asked him if he robbed Alderman Heathcote , he said no . He asked him if he robbed the coach at Islington , and he told him he did , and that he would make large discoveries if he was admitted an Evidence . Pris . Ryley . Was not you and that Gentleman [ Mr. Edwards ] pumping me and desiring me to become an Evidence ? Richardson . We did so . I did ask you to turn Evidence . Panton Maurice . I live at the King's-arms in Bishopsgate Church-yard . Last Thursday was sennight about twelve o'clock at noon , there was a trunk brought with a direction to be left at the King's-arms in Bishopsgate Church-yard . I went up stairs into a large drinking room , and there was the Evidence Askin , and the two Prisoners together . I asked them if any of them owned a trunk that was ordered to be left at my house , and Askin said it was his trunk , that he had some clothes in it and designed to send it to an Inn to go to West Chester . I had a letter from Capt . Dodd to bring the trunk to Justice Fraser 's , and it was carried there afterwards ; there were in it three silver watches , a silver snuff-box , & c. Q . Was there a baragon coat in it ? Maurice . I can not swear to any coat , there were several coats there . Pris . Ryley . I am no ways concerned in it : did I give you any charge of any thing ? Maurice . No , you said nothing - I saw them all there once or twice before . Pris . Ryley . Mr. Maurice knows me . Maurice . I have seen him several times , and have heard he is a Gentleman 's son . Both guilty Death . 404 . + John MackEvoy , of St. John Hackney , was indicted ( with Christopher Askin not taken ) for assaulting John Gostelow on the highway , putting him in fear and taking from him a watch , value 3 l. the property of Thomas Cox , and 2 s. 6 d. in money , the property of the said John Gostelow , August 15th . John Gostelow . I am coachman to Alderman Heathcote . On the 15th of August , I was driving the Alderman to Walthamslow , and going over Hackney marsh about the midway between the bridge and Hummerton gate , about nine o'clock at night three or four men came up to the coach on foot ; the first man that came up clapped a pistol to me , and said if I stirred another step he would blow my brains out . Q . Is the Prisoner the person ? Gostelow . I believe he is not , but I ca n't be positive ; then another person came to me , put his hand in my pocket , and took my watch and 2 s. 6 d. in money . Alderman Heathcote . Did he take only the watch out of your pocket , or the money and watch both ? Gostelow . I believe he took both ; but I can not be positive - my back was towards them , and I had some difficulty to keep the horses quiet , that I had no opportunity of making much observation . Q . Had the person that came up to you and took your watch and money any pistol in his hand ? Gostelow . I did not observe that he had . Q . Did they rob the coach first or you first ? Gostelow . There were some of them robbing the coach , but whether they robbed it at the same time or a little before or a little after I can not tell - after they had robbed me , they turned about and did not return any more - they went off towards the gate , towards Hack ney . Q . Is the watch your own ? Gostelow . It is mine and it is not - it was in pawn to me for about two guineas - when I was paid the two guineas I was to return the watch . Patrick Askin . On the 15th of August , MackEvoy , Christopher Askin and I went into Hackney marsh , and about nine o'clock at night we saw a coach . I went up before to see what sort of a coach it was , and I believe Christopher Askin stopped the coach - the Prisoner and Christopher Askin had pistols , and I had a hanger . Q . Who robbed the coachman ? Askin . John MackEvoy robbed him of his watch , and I robbed him of his money - MackEvoy had the coachman 's watch for his share . Prisoner . Was it one person that robbed you or were there two ? Gostelow . I think it was one person that robbed me both of watch and money . Q. to Askin . You say you took his money . Askin . Yes , I got up upon the coach box and took his money . Q . Who robbed the coach ? Askin . John MackEvoy . Q . Did he rob the Alderman before he robbed the coachman ? Askin . Yes . Q. to Gostelow . Was your master robbed first or you ? Gostelow . Really I ca n't say , I think it was at the same time . Q . Was it the same man that robbed the Alderman , that robbed you ? Gostelow . It was dark , I could not tell . Askin . After I had taken the coachman 's money I rifled the footman . Then we went towards Hackney , and went that night to the blue Lion in Red-Lion Street . Alderman Heathcote . Did the coachman readily deliver his watch ? Askin . No , he was very unwilling to deliver it . Alderman Heathcote . How came he to deliver it then ? Askin . I believe , because you said , give him the watch and I 'll make you satisfaction for it . Q. to Gostelow . Did the man that bid you stand stay till the coach was robbed , or did he go away directly ? Gostelow . He went off a little way , and came up again . Prisoner . Was Alderman Heathcote 's footman robbed of any thing ? Askin . He was robbed of some money . - I ca n't tell how much , because we committed several robberies that night ; I put all the money together . [ Alderman Heathcote made a motion to speak . ] Prisoner . I beg your silence , Mr. Alderman Heathcote , if you please ; I desire Askin may be asked , whether he took a watch from Alderman Heathcote 's footman ? Askin . No , I did not take a watch from him , if I had twenty watches I would not deny that I had them . Alderman Heathcote . Did not you search my fingers for rings ? Askin . I came up to you and asked for your rings , and you said you had none , and I took your Honour 's word . Alderman Heathcote . My chariot was stopped in Hackney-Marsh , about the middle of the marsh between the bridge and Hummerton-Gate . One of the persons who came up to the chariot door , and presented a pistol into the chariot , had my money and my watch , and took me out of the chariot and rifled my pockets : I saw one of them at the wheel of the chariot , and heard him say he would blow my coachman 's brains out , if he would not give him the watch . I was afraid he would do the coachman some mischief , as he did not readily give him the watch , and ( as the Evidence has declared ) I desired him to give him the watch , and I would pay him for it . Upon which , my Lord , I believe the coachman either gave them the watch , or suffered them to take it from him - He told me he had lost a watch . Q . Did not you look at the person that robbed you ? Alderman Heathcote . I looked at him a little as he was by the side of the chariot , but I did not look much at him , because I thought he might think I did it with a view of bringing him to justice . Prisoner . Please to ask Mr. Alderman Heathcote whether his footman lost his watch ? Alderman Heathcote . I ca n't tell what my footman lost ; he told me he lost a watch , and I advertised it according to the description he gave me of it . Jury . Mr. Alderman , had two of them pistols ? Alderman Heathcote . I only saw one pistol that I could distinguish . Prisoner . I desire Alderman Heathcote 's footman may be called ? Jonathan Trevethan . I was the footman behind the coach . Q . Was you robbed of any thing ? Trevethan . I was robbed of three shillings and a silver watch . John Thomas the Constable . I was at Justice Fraser 's and saw a box there with several watches and other things in it . Q . Did MackEvoy own the box to be his ? Thomas . No , he did not - I ca n't tell whose the box was ; I opened the box and took out four watches , and I took three out of another box the Saturday before . [ The box that had been in the possession of MackEvoy was produced . ] Q . Did Gostelow challenge one of the watches ? Thomas . Yes . Q . Is this the box the coachman challenged his watch out of ? Thomas . This is the same box ? Peter Burchall gave evidence to the same effect as on the preceding trial ; that on Thursday the 6th of September , the Prisoner came to his house and brought a box , and said his name was John MackEvoy , and that by his order he directed it for Mr. John MackEvoy , to be left at the Nag's-Head-Inn in Liverpool , till called for . That he saw that box opened at Justice Fraser 's , and is the same box the Prisoner left with him ; that there were four watches taken out of the box , and that Gostelow challenged one of those watches as his . Q . Who took the box from your house to Justice Fraser 's ? Burchall . I believe it was Alderman Heathcote 's Beadle that broke open my counting-house , and took it up there . Prisoner . I have witnesses to prove where I was at the time they charge me with these things , but they are in the country , so your Lordship may go on with my trial as you please . Guilty . Death . 405 , 406 . + Luke Ryley , and John MackEvoy , of St. George Hanover-Square , were indicted for assaulting Joseph Hazard , in a certain field or open place near the King 's highway , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him a fustian frock with twelve silver buttons , value 20 s. a watch , value 40 s. and 3 s. in money , the property of the said Joseph Hazard , August 28 . Joseph Hazard . On the 28th of August as I was going over the five fields to Chelsea , two men came up to me with pistols in their hands , one presented one of them on one side of my head , and the other presented the other pistol on the other side . - They held them I believe about two inches from my head , one of them had a hanger drawn : I ca n't tell whether both of them had ; one of them said either your money or your watch immediately , but I ca n't tell which . I said , gentlemen , I will give you my money directly , and I gave them 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. in silver ; then they asked me for my watch and my gold . I told them I had no watch , for I had put it into my coat pocket ; they said they must search me : one of them put his hand into my breeches pocket , and took out a 36 s. piece with some keys . I asked them for the keys , and they returned them ; they searched my coat on each side and felt nothing ; then they insisted upon having the coat , and they took it from me with my watch in one of the pockets , and went away directly . Q . Was there any other man with them ? Hazard . I saw but two of them : I met a single person before , but he did not say any thing to me . I saw my watch and my buttons at Justice Fraser 's . This is my watch and these are my buttons . Q . Do you know the Prisoners faces ? Hazard . I do n't know their faces , their hats were quite flapped over them ; it was very dark , they were much about the same size as the Prisoners . Patrick Askin called . Q . Do you know of any robbery that you committed on the 28th of August . Askin . I know of a robbery about that time , but I ca n't tell the day - It was on a Monday or a Tuesday : Luke Ryley , John MackEvoy , and I , set out from the Two Chairman in Drury-Lane in order to rob : we went Chelsea way . I was coming towards London between 8 and 9 at night , a good way before them , to see if there was any watch upon the road . I saw a man coming , and turned back and met Luke Ryley and John MackEvoy in the second field ; they told me they had robbed a man of his watch , a coat , hat and wig , and blamed me because I did not give them notice of the man as he came by me - It was a fustian frock about my size with silver buttons . Ryley . Ask the Prosecutor whether he lost a hat and wig ? Hazard . No , I did not . Q . What makes you say that they told you they robbed him of a hat and wig ? Askin . We had so many hats and wigs that I might make a mistake - They said they robbed him of a 36 s. piece - We took a watch from a coachman one Strutton , and then divided the booty . Q . Who had Hazard 's watch ! Askin . John MackEvoy had the watch and buttons , Ryley had the Portugal piece of gold . - MackEvoy bought the buttons for 16 s and I bought the coat for 8 s. the money was divided between us . Ryley . You said just now we robbed the man of his hat and wig , were there any other robberies that we committed that night ? Askin . We stopped another man on horseback that night and fired at him , but did not rob him . - We gave a coat and a snuff box to Ryley 's man . Q . Did he keep a man ? Askin . Yes , I forget his name , he was his servant , he brought him from Ireland . John Thomas . There were several watches taken out of this box , but I do n't know whether this watch was - Mr . Hazard 's watch . Mr. Burchall gave evidence as on the former trials , that MackEvoy brought this box to his house , and that he saw Mr . Hazard 's watch and buttons taken out of it at the Justice 's . John Thomas . I had this key of Captain Dodd , and this is the key that belongs to the box . John Dell . These keys [ there were three keys produced ] I took out of Ryley 's breeches pocket while he was in bed - This is the key that opened the box , the buttons were taken out of . Ryley . What do you know it by ? Dell . I know it by a dent in it . Ryley . How do you know the breeches you took the keys out of , were my breeches ? Dell . Because you owned the breeches , MackEvoy 's breeches were leather . Ryley . I asked you for a mark upon the keys , and you will not tell me any . MackEvoy . Gentlemen of the Jury , please to hear me ; that key is mine and I can give the description of it before I see it : was there a string to it or no ? Dell . Two of them were tied together with a reddish string , but the other bright key that opened the box had no string . Guilty Death .

Henry Jones . I had business to do last Sunday in Whitechappel , and returning home in the evening with William Berry over Moorfields , it rained , and we went in and drank a pot of beer ; going down Long-Lane between 9 and 10 o'clock , Berry stopped to do his occasions and I went on a little before . As soon as I came to the cross way to go into Hosier-Lane , I was stopped on the highway by three fellows ; the Prisoners are two of them , and the other was a lusty fellow ; he laid hold of my breast , and I said , what do you want ? Another came up to me and said , he wanted my money - That genleman there in the blue , Peirson ; and he bid Fitzwalter put his hand in my pocket , and see what money I had got , and said if I said any thing he would rip me open . Q . Had he a knife in his hand ? Jones . I believe he had a knife in his hand : Berry was then coming along , and I cried , hollo , Mr. Berry ! and then the lusty fellow jumped over the rails with my hat and wig . Q . Did either of the Prisoners put his hand in your pocket ? Jones . Yes , Fitzwalter did , and took out 5 s. 6 d. then Mr. Berry came up ; I laid hold of Fitzwalter , and Berry laid hold of Peirson ; we endeavoured to get them to a publick house to secure them , and up came four or five lusty fellows and said , D - n your eyes let them go , or we will cut you as small as sausages - They had something in their hands , but I ca n't tell whether they were knives or swords , and we were obliged to let them go to preserve our lives , but they were taken again on Tuesday night . Q . How came you to know them again as it was so late in the night ? Jones . The lamps were very light - I am sure the Prisoners are the persons ; I took particular notice of them and of their cloaths . William Berry . Mr. Jones and I went out together last Sunday , and returning home going down Long-Lane , I had occasion to ease myself and he kept on . In about two or three minutes I came up with him , and he was by the rounds near Hosier-Lane , I said , Hollo , Mr. Jones ! said he , I am robbed . I took hold of this boy in the blue coat [ Peirson ] and Jones took hold of him in the green [ Fitzwalter ] one had an apron on hanging down , and the other had something about him tucked up . I saw Jones without his hat and wig ; then four or five fellows came up to us and said , What are you going to do with those boys ? One of them had a stick and jobbed it in my face , and they said they would cut us as small as sausages if we did not let them go , and indeed I was glad to let them go . - I saw something glisten , but whether it was a sword or a hanger I can not tell - I know these are the persons , because we had them a minute or two under a lamp in Smithfield . The Tuesday following I saw the Prisoners in the fair in Southwark , and I said to one that was there , these chaps robbed a friend of mine last Sunday . I dogged them out of the fair to St. Margaret's-Hill , and then took them ; and Peirson said in the coach as we were coming along , that we could not hurt them , for they did nothing but pick pockets of handkerchiefs - They said they lived in Black Boy-Alley . Peirson . We have no witnesses , we have none but our own dear selves . Both Guilty Death . Peirson . I am between fourteen and fifteen years old . Fitzwalter . I was thirteen years old last July . The Jury on account of their youth , recommended them to the Court as objects of his Majesty 's mercy . 410 . + Adrian Hambagh , otherwise Kambagh , late of the Liberty of the Tower of London , in the County of Middlesex , was indicted for that he , not having the fear of God before his eyes , but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil , on the 4th day of September , in the 18th year of his Majesty 's reign , with force and arms at the said parish in the said county , in and upon one Thomas Kempton , in the peace of God and our said Lord the King , then and there being feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did make an assault , and that he the said Adrian Hambagh , otherwise Kambagh , with a certain knife made of iron and steel , of the value of one penny , which he the said Adrian then and there had and held in his right hand ; him the said Thomas Kempton in and upon the back of him the said Thomas Kempton , under the right shoulder of him the said Thomas , then and there feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did strike and stab , giving to him the said Thomas Kempton , then and there with the knife aforesaid , in and upon the back of him the said Thomas Kemp ton , under the right shoulder of him the said Thomas , one mortal wound of the breadth of one inch , and of the depth of four inches , of which mortal wound the said Thomas Kempton , at the said liberty , in the said county , and at the parish of St. Mary Mat-Fellon , in the county aforesaid , from the said 4th day of September of the said year , until the 8th day of September of the same year did languish , and languishing did live , on which said 8th day of September in the said year , the said Thomas Kempton at the said parish of St. Mary Mat-Fellon , in the said county , of the said mortal wound did die , and that he the said Adrian Hambagh , otherwise Kambagh , him the said Thomas Kempton , in manner and form aforesaid , feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did kill and murder , against his Majesty 's peace , his crown and dignity . To which he pleaded not guilty , and put himself to be tried by God and this country . He was a second time charged by virtue of the Coroner 's inquisition for the murder of the said Thomas Kempton . Jeremiah Hartcup . On the 4th of this instant about six o'clock in the evening , the deceased and I were walking on little Tower-hill , I saw the Prisoner in company with a woman standing close to the houses . After I had passed the Prisoner , I walked I believe about ten yards and missed my companion ( the deceased ) I looked back and saw the deceased talking to the Prisoner , upon which having a suspicion of a quarrel , I came back again and interposed between the Prisoner and the deceased . I got between the deceas 'd and the Prisoner without saying any thing to him or he to me , seeing the knife drawn and having no weapon of defence , neither sword nor stick , I went back , and going back the Prisoner made a stab at me with his knife ; upon his making the push at me I got upon the hill , where I saw six or seven Gentlemen with sticks or cane in their hands , upon which I related the affair to them and begged one of them to lend me a stick to defend my life , which I apprehended to be in danger and borrowed one ; I came back to the Prisoner ( who I still saw with his knife drawn ) and said to him , You villain , if you do n't put up your knife I 'll knock you down - I held the stick up at him but did not strike him . The Prisoner upon my threatning him in this manner put his knife up ; upon which I was going to return the stick to the Gentleman I borrowed it of , but before I gave it to him I met with another Dutchman ( as I suppose by his apparel ) and he had one of his hands in the side pocket of his breeches . Then I heard some people cry out for me to take care of my self for he had his hand upon a knife , upon which I bid him keep off or I would knock him down , and the man did not offer to come any further ; so I looked back and saw the Prisoner pursuing the deceased , who was retreating backwards . * The Prisoner being a Dutchman [ a sailor who lately came home with Commodore Anson ] and not understanding English , an interpreter was sworn . Q . Had the deceased a stick in his hand ? Hartcup . The deceased had a stick in his hand and kept going backwards , and the Prisoner with a knife in his hand was pursuing him - I saw the deceased make some blows at the Prisoner at that time with a stick - I ca n't say whether he struck him or no ; upon which the Prisoner rushed upon the deceased , got on his left side and stabbed him in the back . Q . Did he close with him or hold him ? Hartcup . The Prisoner put his left hand to the fore part of the deceased 's body , and put his right hand behind him and stabbed him in the back , upon which the Prisoner run into the sign of the Hamburgh-arms . I seeing what was done pursued him as fast as I could , and came up to the door of the house , but was refused admittance and I could not get in ; then I returned back to the deceased and he was carried into Justice Willoughby 's brewhouse yard : I saw him there lying upon some boards . I believe Mr. Willoughby sent for a Surgeon and he examined the wound - it was under his right shoulder and bled pretty much . I attended him to the Infirmary in Goodmans-fields . About an hour and half after the thing was done , as I was going up stairs with him I asked him how he did ; the answer he made me was , that he should die , and he repeated it often that he should die and was a dead man - the deceased was a soldier , I was conscious he would die and I sat myself down by his bed-side - this might be about three hours after the wound was received : I asked him whether he gave the first offence , the answer he made me was , as I hope for mercy I did not offend him at all [ that is the Prisoner ] . He said he saw a woman in the Prisoner 's company and passed them , but the passage being very narrow he believed he might touch both the Prisoner and the woman , and at that instant of time he received a blow from the Prisoner with a stick ; this the deceased alledged to me was the Reason of his first stopping ; this is all I have to say , my Lord - the deceased was a very civil man , had not been above a month in the regiment , and had an estate in the country of 33 l. a year . John Hagar . I am a labourer at the Victualling-office , about half an hour after six I saw the deceased and the Prisoner at the Hamburgh-arms door . There the Prisoner drew his knife and followed the deceased about twelve yards . I said to the deceased take care of yourself or he will stick you : I believe I said so three or four times . Soon after I had given him this caution , the Prisoner jumped upon the deceased and stabbed him in the back - The deceased had a stick in his hand , but did not strike the Prisoner , as the Prisoner pursued him he held his stick up ( as I believe ) to keep his guard in his own defence . Fortune Willoughby . I happened to hear a noise and run to the gate of the brew-house yard , and I saw the deceased strike the Dutchman two blows with a stick , he offered to strike a third time and his arm fell down . Upon that the deceased clapp 'd his left hand to his coat and waistcoat , unbuttoned it and pulled it off , and the blood came through his shirt from his right shoulder down to his breeches ; then the landlady of the Hamburgh-arms came out and took the Prisoner into the house . With that the deceased 's comrade [ Hartcup ] came up and broke the windows and the mob rose so high that I thought they would have pulled the house down - I believe Hartcup did it for fear they should favour the escape of the Prisoner - I did not see any thing before the two blows , but I thought this was a very peaceable Dutchman to take two blows without striking again , not knowing that the deceased had received a wound before - when he came into the yard he was very bad ; a Surgeon came to examine the wound and I looked on it , which I was sorry I did , for I never saw such a wound in my life - it was a sort of a triangle . The deceased was carried to the Infirmary . Mary Mayhew . Coming by the Ditch-side , I saw a great multitude of people , and saw a Dutchman with a knife in his hand following a man . His hand was round the handle of the knife and he closed in upon him ; - he put his hand to the forepart of his body and jobbed the knife into his back , and then gave his hand a turn - whether it was to pull it out , or to put it in farther I can not say , and as soon as he had stabbed him , he went into the Hamburgh arms . Robert Stevens . I am a labourer belonging to the Victualling-office . As I was coming along I saw a great crowd and the deceased retiring backwards , and the Prisoner pursuing him with a knife in his hand - the deceased had a stick in his hand and did hold it up , but I did not see him strike ; then the Dutchman stabbed him in the same manner as the other witnesses have related . Q . Do you know whether the deceased had struck the Prisoner before ? Stevens . I did not see a blow struck : the deceased did offer to strike him ; but the Prisoner closed in upon him and stabbed him . Mr. Harrison . The unhappy fellow the deceased was brought into the London Infirmary on Tuesday the 4th of September . I did not see him that night , my brother Surgeon of the Infirmary dressed him . The next day I took off the dressing and observed a wound in the back about an inch in length at a small distance from the Spine . I did not see that it bled at that time or that it had bled in the night ; but upon enlarging the external wound , I perceived that it penetrated into the cavity of the breast between the 10th and 11th ribs through which I could very easily pass my finger next day at the dressing of the wound ; upon opening of the wound there was so large a discharge of blood that the man fainted with the loss of it . I took a proper method to prevent a greater effusion being apprehensive of fatal consequences . The symptoms of death encreased so fast that I thought it impossible to do him any good , and he died on Saturday night . Q . Was the wound made at once ? Harrison . It was made at once , for the knife came out in the same direction it went in : I opened the body on Sunday night , and then I made farther discoveries , which confirmed me in the opinion that the wound was the occasion of his death . Q . According to the account that has been given of the wound it was just under the right shoulder . Harrison . That account is erroneous . Q . What was the depth of the wound ? Harrison . I imagine the depth of the wound to be about four inches . The knife must have passed between those ribs through the Diaphragma and wounded the liver ; there was a wound in the liver of near two inches in depth and one in width , and I am very certain that wound was the immediate cause of his death . Q . Did he bleed much inwardly ? Harrison . The cavity of the Thorax might contain at that time a quart or three pints of blood besides what he must have lost before . Q . Did you hear the deceased make any declarations as to the occasion of this accident ? Harrison . He told me he had not given any offence to this Dutchman either by word or deed , and if he had brushed against him or given him any shove , it must have been inadvertently and undesignedly in passing by . - He was very sensible at the time he made this declaration . The Prisoner in his defence said , he was at Mrs. Stepperfields , and saw two or three men walking on Tower-hill , that one of them [ the deceased ] u gainst him , that he asked him why he ran so rudely against him , the other answered him by cursing and swearing and threatning him , to which the Prisoner answered , You must not use me so , you must not speak against my life , that the deceased had a stick and struck him two or three times , and the other soldier [ Hartcup ] coming up , he was necessitated to draw his knife in his defence ; but does not know that he wounded the deceased . Mary Stepperfield . I keep the Hamburgh-arms . I saw the Prisoner and the deceased at words , the Prisoner gave his stick away and said what do you intend to fight ? Then the deceased said , what does that son of a bitch come upon the Hill for ? In the mean while another Dutchman took hold of the Prisoners arm to keep him from fighting , then the deceased run and snatched a stick out of another person 's hand , came behind him and struck him three or four blows over his head , and he had nothing to defend himself with , so he put his right hand into his pocket and drew his knife , and said , take care of your self , keep off , and then jumped at him under the left arm , and stabbed him . Q . Did the Prisoner speak in English or Dutch ? Stepperfield . He spoke in Dutch . Q . Did not you see the Prisoner pursue the deceased ? Stepperfield . No , not at all - the Dutchman had done nothing at all to the deceased that I know of - I did not see the first blow , I saw the deceased give the Prisoner two blows before the accident happened . Q . How far might they be from one another , before the Prisoner stabbed him ? Stepperfield . Not above two yards at the highest . Q. I would ask you whether at the time the Prisoner said keep off , he was not following the deceased ? Stepperfield . He run up to him , he had his knife in his hand then , to do something or other . Q . When was the first time the soldier struck the Dutchman ? Stepperfield . Just before the thing was done - the Prisoner did not pursue the deceased before the deceased struck him . Q . When the Dutchman said keep off , did not the deceased retire ? Stepperfield . No , he did not ; the Prisoner had turned his face to my house in order to go away , and the deceased struck him two or three blows , then the Prisoner turned upon him - both the Soldiers had struck him before he drew his knife - After he had stabbed the deceased , Hartcup came and broke all the windows in the house . Hartcup . There were but three panes of glass broke . John Christian Bremer . [ being a foreigner his Evidence was given by the Interpreter ] . I came out of Stepperfield 's house and saw the Prisoner in trouble , I said what have you to do with them ? I took him away pretty near to Stepperfield 's house , and then both the Soldiers came up to him , and both of them struck him upon his head till he reeled ; I was in fear of being struck by them , so I left the Prisoner . The Prisoner seeing himself alone drew his knife and stabbed him in the manner you have heard . Q. I would ask you whether you did not see the deceased retire , and the Prisoner pursuing him with his knife in his hand ? Bremer . No , I did not ; before the Prisoner stabbed him , he said , beware ( in Dutch ) and one of the Soldiers , ( I think it was the deceased ) gave him two or three blows more after the wound was given - both the Soldiers beat him before the wound was given . Francis Stedt . I am a Hamburgh man . I saw a Soldier [ Hartcup ] fighting with another Sailor . After that one of the Soldiers gave the Prisoner such a terrible blow on the head , that he had like to have tumbled down - the deceased struck the Prisoner before he drew his knife , and then the Prisoner gave him a push in the back - whether he had a knife or no I ca n't tell - he went under and struck him in the back - both the Soldiers struck the Prisoner before he gave the wo . Elizabeth Henry ( servant to Stepperfield ) I was going out of my mistress 's house and saw the Prisoner running to come in . The deceased came behind him and gave him three blows with a stick which made him reel ; the Prisoner asked him whether he had a mind to fight ? the deceased said , yes , then the deceased struck him again - Upon that the Prisoner immediately put his hand into his pocket , but I ca n't tell whether he drew his knife or not . Q . Do you understand Dutch ? Henry . No , Sir . Q . You say you do n't understand Dutch , how could you tell what the Dutchman said ? Henry . A little I do , I could understand that ; he spoke half Dutch and half English . Thomas Way . I was at the Hamburgh-Arms , and hearing a noise I went out , and saw a man in a white coat , and a red waistcoat [ the deceased ] push the Prisoner with his arm ; the Prisoner asked him in Dutch if he would fight - The deceased had no stick , but he jumped over the way and took a stick with a nob at the end of it from another person , and gave the Prisoner three or four strokes over the head , so that he could hardly stand ( there was another Dutchman by , and he went away for fear he should have some other blows ) then the deceased gave the Prisoner some other blows . The Dutchman put his hand to his head to put his hat right , and then put his hand in his pocket and spoke a word that I did not understand - During all this time the deceased was not wounded at all . Christopher Robinson ( a Dutchman . ) I lodge at the Hamburgh-Arms , I saw Hartcup give the Prisoner the first blow with a stick - The deceased struck him at the same time , and gave him several blows before he offered to pull out his knife . Maltus Schutz . The Prisoner has lodged with me nine or ten weeks , I never saw him quarrelsom in my life , he was so far from that , that he used to keep peace among his companions . - Downes ( Constable . ) I am pretty much in this house , and have seen the Prisoner frequently there , he always behaved well and had the best of characters . Q. to Hartcup . I ask you before such time as the wound was given to the deceased , did you strike the Prisoner ? Hartcup . No , upon my oath - I never gave him any one blow at all ; and no blow was given ( that I saw ) till the wound was given . Q . Did you see Sarah Stepperfield there ? Hartcup . I did not see her till after the wound was given ; she came out of the house , but there was no body at the door till after the wound was given . Jury . Are you sure the deceased did not strike the Prisoner ? Hartcup . No , I am not sure of that . The Jury brought in their verdict Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 411 . + Ann Hocks , otherwise Hawhswell , otherwise called Ann , the wife of Dincent Matthews , of Ealing , otherwise Zealing , was indicted for assaulting Moses Brotherton , in a certain field or open place near the King 's highway , on the 8th day of February last , putting him in fear , & c. and taking from him one promissory note , commonly called a bank note , N . 100. subscribed with the name Andrew Prime , for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , bearing date London the 16th day of January 1743 , of the value of 20 l. by which same note he the said Andrew Prime , for the Governor and Company of the Bank of England , did promise to pay to Matthew Collett or bearer on demand , the sum of 20 l.

Moses Brotherton . On the 8th day of February last I was going from the Post Office with the Western mail to Staines - Joseph Tapping and I were together ; and upon Turnham-Green a person in man 's clothes on horseback came up to me . Q . Did the person ride a straddle ? Brotherton . Yes ; Joseph Tapping the other boy was stopped first , and the person told him there was something in the mail that belonged to him , and Tapping said if there was he should not have it - Then the person stopped me , and said I must go along with him and he would not hurt me , then I was carried into a great field about half a mile out of the way ; to the side of a great gravel pit , and the person desired me to jump down that place ; I told him I could not , but at last I jumped down - He made me jump down , for he was going to draw a pistol at me . Q . Did you jump down with your horse ? Brotherton . I sat on my horse and jumped down , I ca n't say I jumped down , for I tumbled down ; then the person opened the mail and took out the Exeter bag and the Portsmouth bag . Q . Did the person stay with you after that ? Brotherton . She put her hand in her pocket , and gave me a shilling . Prisoner 's Council . What makes you say , her ? Brotherton . Because I took her to be a woman . Council . What made you think so ? Brotherton . I thought so by her voice and her hand . Council . Why by her hand ? Brotherton . Because it was a soft hand . Council . How do you know it was a soft hand . Brotherton . Bec ause she took hold of my hand when I was in the pit . Council . What did she take hold of your hand for ? Brotherton . She shook hands with me . Council . Look at that woman with the child in her arms , and see whether you think she is the person ? Brotherton . I ca n't be positive to the person - The person had a crape over her face ; and a long white wig on . Q . Can you give any description of the clothes the person had on , or of the horse ? Brotherton . Yes , the person had on a blue great coat , and rode upon a bald faced sorrel horse . Q . Have you heard the Prisoner speak since ? Brotherton . Yes , and I believe her to be e same person . Q . Why do you take her to be the same person ? Brotherton . By her voice , Sir . Jury . How long was it after the 8th of February before you saw the Prisoner again ? Brotherton . I believe it was about a month - At Sir Thomas de Veil 's . Q . When you were with her there , had you any apprehension that the voice was the same ? Brotherton . Yes , Sir ? Q . And you take upon you to swear that you thought then it was the same voice ? Brotherton . I can not swear 't is the same voice . - I said to Sir Thomas de Veil that I thought it to be the same voice . Q . What time did this thing happen ? Brotherton . Between six and seven in the morning - I believe I did not go out of the office till five . Q . Where did you go after you were robbed ? Brotherton . I went to Staines - I told them I had been robbed - I did not say any thing of it 's being a woman 's voice there - I did when I came to London to Mr. Robinson the Sollicitor to the Post-Office , that I thought it was a woman 's voice , and to Mr. Jesse . Q . When was the crape put over the person 's face ? Brotherton . After I was in the pit ; and the person kept my hat something over my eyes , that I could not very well see . Sir Thomas de Veil . I believe it was on the 29th of March that the Prisoner and Brotherton were before me , and Brotherton gave an account about the robbing the Western mail , and he said then that he was sure it was a woman by her voice , and by her hand : he said to the best of his remembrance the person that robbed him and gave him the shilling was the person that was then before me ; and I think he said that he verily believed that the same blue veins that appeared there , were the same that gave him the shilling . John Jesse . When the Post-boy came to town , he gave an account to the Post Master General that he was robbed . I was immediately sent for ; I asked him whether he could remember any thing about the voice , and he said , it was a comical voice , it was not like a man 's voice , it was a womanish voice . Q . What sort of a person was it for height ? Brotherton . It was a tall person . Sir Thomas de Veil . I must absolutely contradict him there , for when he was before me , he said it was a short thick person , and much about the height of the person then before me . There being no other evidence on the side of the prosecution to prove the fact upon the Prisoner , and the Jury not thinking this evidence sufficient , she was acquitted . 412. Peter de St . Remye , otherwise John Lafontaine , otherwise Lafountaine , otherwise Delafountame , of the Parish of St. James 's Westminster , Gent . was indicted for that he on the 7th day of March in the 14th year of his present Majesty 's reign , in the parish of St. Bridget , otherwise St . Brides , did marry one Ann Hatfield Spinster , and her then and there had for his wife , and that he the said Peter de St . Remye , & c. afterwards to wit on the 6th day of August in the 18th year of his Majesty 's reign at the parish of St. George , Hanover-Square , did feloniously marry * and to wife take , Anne Yarp widow , his former wife Ann being then living and in full life , against the form of the Statute and against his Majesty 's peace , & c . * This prosecution is founded upon an Act of Parliament made in the 1st of James 1st , chap . 11. whereby 't is enacted that if any person or persons shall marry , the former husband or wife being living , every such offence shall be Felony , and the person and persons so offending shall suffer death as in Cases of Felony . Then it is provided that this Act shall not extend to any person or persons , whose husband or wife shall be continually remaining beyond the seas by the space of seven years together , or whose husband or wife shall absent him or herself he one from the other by the space of seven years in any part within his Majesty 's dominions , the one not knowing the other to be living within that time , or where the person is divorced from the first marriage , or where the former marriage is made void by sentence in the Ecclesiastical Court . The Prisoner being a Frenchman desired , a Jury , De medietate Linguae , which was granted , and is as follows , Thomas Niccol James Dalbiac Ralph Marsh Daniel Pilleau Daniel Wedon . Simon Dalbiac Jarvis Weston Peter Meigett Henry Bristow Peter Pontie Francis Calloway Lapton Jourquet . Sarah Rogers . I was acquainted with Mrs. Ann Hatfield when she lived in St. Anns Soho , she passed for a single woman - I saw the Prisoner once there , and she told me she was to be married to that Gentleman - she said he was a Gentleman - I told her he looked like a Jew , and I understood he was angry with me for saying so - he went then by the name of Peter de St . Remye . William Dare - I am a Clergyman of the church of England . Q . Look at the Prisoner , and see if you remember him . Dare . I remember the Gentleman very well , I married him the 7th of March 1740 . In the evening after it was dark - by candle-light at the house of one Mrs. Crook in the Fleet-Market : by the name of Peter de St . Remye , of the parish of St. Anns Westminster , Gentleman and Batchelor , to Ann Hatfield of the same parish Spinster - the Prisoner not only told me his name , but at the same time took a pen and ink and wrote it down , that I might set it down right , this is the entry I made in my book at that time . Q . Who told you that the woman 's name was Ann Hatfield ? Dare . She did her self , and bid me set her down Spinster ; before the Prisoner came to the house , two women , one of whom was Mrs. Ann Hatfield , came there and enquired if they could have a Clergyman , and Mrs. Crook sent for me , and one of them made an agreement with me what I was to have for the marriage - that was 13 s. 6 d. and the Prisoner came in and consented to the agreement - I lived in Fleet-Lane then , but was not a Prisoner . Pris . Coun . Did the Prisoner pay that money ? Dare . It was laid down upon the book with the ring , I ca n't tell who laid it down - they were married according to the form of the Common-prayer and the Ceremonies of the Church of England ; I took the Gentleman 's hand and joined to the woman 's , whether he thought the ceremony was over or no , I ca n't say , but he went to salute her , and I said , pray do n't be in a hurry , have a little patience , and then you may do as you please - she was given away by a Gentleman I do n't know . After the ceremony was over he gave the gentlewoman of the house a shilling for officiating as clerk , I said it was usual to give something more ; he frowned , which made the cresses in his forehead appear more than ordinary , and I took particular notice of him - I observed his nose was remarkable ; my Lord , there is something more corroborating , a gentleman came to me some little time afterwards , to know whether I had married one Mrs. Ann Hatfield to one Mr. Remye , I said I had , he said with an oath ( your Lordship will excuse me ) I am glad of it , for I did not think any body would have had her she is so d - n ugly ; and he said he was glad for other reasons that he did not tell me - He called her his sister-in-law , and desired a stamped certificate . I gave him a certificate with a 5 s. stamp , and he gave me half a guinea for my trouble , and paid the stamps beside . Q . Was she a homely woman ? Dare . She was a very ordinary woman , a tall thin woman . Prosecutor 's Council . Then she was not a tempting piece ? Dare . She would not have tempted me . Prisoner 's Council . Can you take upon you to say that the Prisoner married Ann Hatfield ? William Dare . I am as positive to the Prisoner 's being the person who married one who called herself Ann Hatfield , as I am that my name is William Dare - I never saw the Prisoner since till yesterday to my knowledge . Another thing I thought very odd , he came in a plain hat , and as soon as the ceremony was over , the gentlewoman pulled a lace hat out of a handkerchief and he put it on . Prisoner 's Council . Did the Prisoner make responses ? Dare . If he had not , I should have done as I do at all times , desire him to speak so as I might hear him , for I am a little deaf , but he spoke with an audible voice . Barbara Crook . I live in the Fleet-Market , about three or four years ago two women came about a wedding , and I sent for Mr. Dare a Clergyman of the Church of England , one of them agreed for 13 s. 6 d. - I am very certain the Prisoner is the person who was married to one of those women - Not to her that made the agreement - The marriage was performed according to the ceremony of the Church of England ; before the ceremony was gone through the Prisoner offered to salute her , and Mr. Dare checked him for it , and said it was time enough for that when the ceremony was over .

Elizabeth Doo . I was servant to Mr. Diggle , I saw the Prisoner strike my master three blows , only because he interposed between him and his mistress : the Prisoner abused his mistress , and offered to strike Mr. Diggle , and Mrs. Newman said do n't strike Mr. Diggle for he is Constable , and he said , Let him be Constable or Churchwarden , or what he will , I 'll do for him ; he forced in between my master and his mistress , and struck him several blows .

I heard some words , and the Prisoner and the Deceased were standing at a considerable distance one from the other in a posture of fighting : and I heard the Prisoner say , Let him be Constable or Churchwarden , by G - d I will do for him . I went back to the Deceased 's house , and said for God 's sake , gentlemen , let us prevent mischief : and in about a minute 's time the unhappy blow was given ; the left side of his face was very bloody , and he seemingly not sensible of the damage he had received , sat down in a chair and declined his head upon his left hand , and the Prisoner said , D - n his blood let him be Constable or Churchwarden , I know I have done for him .

The Deceased said the Prisoner 's father might be a thief and a rogue as well as another man ; then the Prisoner said to me , mind , he calls my father thief : then the Prisoner got up , and the Deceased said , a n't you a deceitful dog , you told your master you could not get up ; then the Deceased hit the Prisoner a slap on the face , struck him twice , and called him thief , and then they both fell to fighting - The Deceased struck the Prisoner before he gave him any blow - I ca n't say the Deceased kicked the Prisoner in anger , it might be to make him get up . Mrs. Newman . Mr. Diggle came home with my husband and the Prisoner , and brought some silver home , and laid it upon the table . The Prisoner made a motion to throw the silver at me , with that my husband took him in his arms and they fell down upon the ground , then I persuaded my husband to go up to bed and went up with him , he bid the deceased good night , and bid the Prisoner go to bed ; he said , he would not , he would lie there . When I came down the maid said the deceased had called the Prisoner 's father old rogue , the Prisoner jumpt up and the deceased called him a deceitful rogue , & c. As in the maid 's Evidence . The deceased hit the Prisoner a slap on the face and called him thief , the Prisoner said , call me thief again , and he called him thief again , and then they went to fighting and fell down between a table and a chair , when the deceased got up I saw his eye was bloody - I did not see the Prisoner strike the Deceased till they fell a fighting - the Prisoner did not quarrel with me , he only made a motion to throw the silver at me because he was in liquor . Q . Did not you desire Mr. Diggle to stay to prevent mischief ? Mrs. Newman . I was frightened , if I did , I do n't know that I said so . Mr. Kidney .
