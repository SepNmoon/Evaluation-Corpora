It is the Property of John Barton . There was seventeen Pound Custom-House Weight , it was worth above 5 s. a Pound . - It was about an Hour after they went out of the Shop before I missed it . - I can not tell whether there was any other Customer in the Shop , between the Time of their going out and my missing it .

We sold it to one Elizabeth Bartfoot for five Shillings a Pound . I think it came to 4 l. 5 s. - Briers is transported + for another Fact . - I am in Custody of the Keeper of Newgate .

Thomas Clarke . I went to Church on Sunday the 22d of August , and when I came back I found my Drawer open , it is a Drawer in a Chest of Drawers ; and about two o'Clock this Lad came Home a little fuddled . He had lived with me about three Months . - Mr James ( the next Witness ) was with him , and he begged Pardon , and said he would never do so any more . - He begged Pardon for being Drunk , for he had not been charged with any thing . - I was asked if I had sent him to receive any Money for me , and I said no : Upon this I went to my Drawer , took the Bag out , and laid the Money on the Table , and there seemed to be a good deal less than there was . I missed a 3 l. 12 s. presently . I could not make him confess any thing , so I carried him before a Constable , and he went to the Round-House . I sent for Mr James and asked him if he knew any thing of it , Mr James said , there was one 3 l. 12 s. two 36 s. Pieces , and four Guineas , which he left in his Hand the Day before at Welsh-Fair . I went to the Boy at the Round-House , and he confessed he pushed back the Lock with a Knife , and took out the Money ; he said the Devil told him where the Money was , and that the Devil bid him do it ; he own 'd the 3 l. 12 s. the two 36 s. Pieces , and the four Guineas , and said that was all he took . Mr James . I think the 22d of August , I saw this Boy drinking with three or four Carpenters in Welsh-Fair . I was drinking a Pint of Beer , and seeing him throwing his Money about , I asked him what Country-Boy he was , he said he was out of Wales ; I advised him to go Home , he desired me to drink some Ale ; perhaps , said he , you may think I can not pay for this Ale , though my Hat on my Head is not worth Six-pence , yet I can pay for it , and pulled out one 3 l. 12 s. the Boy said he did not care to go Home , for fear his Master should beat him . I said if he would go Home along with me , his Master should not beat him : Said he , I will give you two Guineas . if you will let me go about my Business ; no , said I , I can not do that , then , said he , take it all . - I thought as he was a little in Liquor , his Master would be angry with me , and think I kept him out , so I would not deliver the Money till Mr Clarke came to me . Said Mr Clarke to me , Have you not two Guineas of my Boy 's ? Yes , said I , I have a great many two Guineas . On Monday Morning he confessed he took four Guineas , two 36 s. Pieces , one 3 l. 12 s. Prisoner . I did not open the Drawer , I found it open , and that Man , James , made me drunk . Q . Can you tell whether the Drawer was locked ? Clarke .

No . 16 . Mary How . I live at Kingsbury , in the County of Middlesex , my House was broke open the 2d of this September . I locked the Door before I went out , but I did not leave any Body in the House . When I came back , I found my House broke open , - the Wall of a back Apartment belonging to my Dwelling-House , the Wall was broke into my Cellar ; seeing that broke , I went up Stairs , and found two of my Drawers open , and missed the Goods and Money mentioned in the Indictment . I live in a lone House . Q . Do you know any thing how the Prisoner at the Bar came to be taken up for this ? How . This Woman was in my Yard , and she described the Man to me . I went to a Farmer hard by , and told him what had happened , and described the Man to him as the Woman had described him to me ; and he pursued him and took him , and the Things were found upon him before I came up , and he desired me to be favourable to him , for that if he was to go before a Justice , he should be a dead Man . John Twyford . I am a Neighbour of this Mrs How 's , she sent me Word by a Woman , that her House was broke open by a Man that worked for me , - he had worked for me about a Month , and I had turned him off . I sent a Man that works for me one Way , and I went another , and when I came to Hendon Church , there was one Hutchins said that he saw such a Man by the Plough ; that he had a good deal of Money , and he believed he did not come honestly by it . I saw the Prisoner laid down in a Ditch on his Face , and he seemed to be fuddled ; the Constable and I searched him , and found all the Things mentioned in the Indictment , and three Pound twelve Shillings . in Silver and Gold ; there was three Handkerchiefs found upon him , he said he took four , but had given one away ; he said at first that we had no Business to stop him , and if we did he would give us trouble for it ; but he confessed it afterwards , he said he crope in at that Place , and crope out there again afterwards . When they are in that Place , they can go all about the House . This is the Purse , I think they say it is a Hart Skin . [ The Things were produced in Court . ] Mrs How . These are all mine , particularly the Purse . There were more Witnesses , but the Court thinking these sufficient , they were not examined . Guilty , Death . 58 . Matth.ew Booney , of Stepney , was indicted for that he , on the 29th of April last , on the King 's Highway , in and upon one Abraham Goodwin did make an Assault , and put the said Abraham Goodwin in Fear and Danger of his Life , and took from him a Watch , val . 5 l. 5 s. a Seal , val . 2 s. a Snuff-Box , val . 20 s. and 18 d. in Silver , the Property of the said Abraham Goodwin . Abraham Goodwin . On Thursday the 29th of April , between Ten and Eleven at Night , between Bow and the Alms-Houses at Mile Edd , ( it was a fine Moon-shiney Night ) I saw two Fellows standing upon the Causeway , on the Right-Hand Side of the Road , each of them had a Pistol in his Hand : They demanded what I had , I told them I would deliver all if they would use me well ; the first thing I delivered was a Seal with a Coat of Arms , with a String , and this Case of a Watch ; he said , Damn your Blood , what is become of the Guts ? I said , Gentlemen , I had forgot it , and gave them that ; then they took from me a Snuff-Box , 18 d. ( and a Handkerchief , and some Half-pence , which is not in the Indictment ) and they made off towards Bow , in the Middle of the Road . I being apprehensive of meeting with some Body else , said , Gentlemen , let me speak a Word to you , you have robbed me , give me a Word by which I may save myself , if I should meet with any Body else ; said one of them , say I have spoke with the Captain , or the Carman , but I think it was the Carman . The Prisoner answers to the Heighth of the Person , and I believe him to be the Person , because I observed a Scar on the Right Side of his Cheek . Cavenagh was dressed in a Brown Coat , I verily believe Cavenagh to be one of them . As to Mooney . I could see the Scar better then than I can now , for his Beard was long and black . Prisoner . Gentlemen , pray observe what he says , he says I had a black Beard , and I have no black Beard . Goodwin . His Beard was rather blacker than it is now . [ William Cavenagh sworn . ] Court . Consider now you are admitted as a Witness , and take Care to speak nothing but what is strictly true . William Cavenagh . I will , my Lord . - On the 29th of April last , the Prisoner at the Bar , John Martin , and myself , went towards Bow between Ten and Eleven at Night , when we came by the Sign of Why not beat Dragon , the Prisoner at the Bar and I went on , Martin said behind , and this Gentleman was walking in the Road Way ; each of us had a Pistol in his Hand , and we demanded his Money : He delivered first the Out-side case of his Watch into Mooney 's Hand , and Mooney gave it to me ; I found it was not compleat , but only a Case , and I asked him for the Guts of it , he said , Gentlemen , I forgot it ; I think he put his Hand into his Breeches and pulled it out : I took a Snuff-Box from him , and a Shilling and a Six-pence in Silver , and 1 d. and when he asked what he should say if he met any Body else , I bid him say he had met the Carman . Prisoner . Ask him how long he has been acquainted with me ? Cavenagh . I came acquainted with him about April , by a Woman that bought stolen Goods . - The Watch was sold to a Man that kept an Alehouse . Prisoner . Ask him why he did not swear against me in his first Information ? William Cavenagh . I did mention him in my first Information ; if you please to look into it you will find it , ( the Information was read and it was found to be so ) . - * Lot Cavenagh is no Relation of mine . * The Person on whose Information the Prisoner was committed . See the Trials in Mr Alderman Perry 's Mayoralty , No . 147 , 148 . Prisoner .

William Cavenagh . Ask him if the Prisoner at the Bar is not his own Son ? Moone . No : he is not my Son , I never knew his Mother in my Life , - he never passed for my Son . Court . It is not customary to work on a Sunday , now the 2d of May proves by the Almanack to be on a Sunday . Moone . Yes sometimes it is , in making Coffins , and he did work for me in making Coffins . - I can not tell which Day the Coffin was made . - I can not tell who the Coffin was for , it was an Oak Coffin . - There was no Undertaker , I was Undertaker . Court . Did you supply the whole Funeral ? - Moone . There was no other Funeral than making of a Coffin . - I found out he was in Goal , by some of his Countrymen ; he did not write to me to come . Prisoner . This William Cavenagh said he had nothing against me , that there was nothing but what Lot Cavenagh had against me . Moone . I live at St Giles 's , in one Gerrard Cavenagh 's House . - I have been in London since Sunday was se'nnight . - I came from Dublin a Fortnight ago , for Debt . - a Debt about 10 or 11 l. - I am an Irishman .

I am Clerk to Mr Penny , an Attorney in New Broad street , my Father is a Woolstapler in Broad-street . Guilty , Death . 59. John Lambert , of St Luke 's , Middlesex , was indicted for breaking open the Dwelling-House of William Brittain , about the Hour of two in the Night , and taking from thence sundry Things , to the Value of 28 s. the Goods of Mary Chambers ; a Perriwig , & c. the Goods of John Chambers ; and other Things the Property of William Brittain , in the Dwelling-House of the said William Brittain , May 16 . William Brittain . I have two Houses , one in Golden and the other in French-Alley , which last was the House that was broke open . I was acquainted with it about four or five in the Morning , and went there and found the out side Window open , and the Wall likewise broke . The Prisoner at the Bar has but an indifferent Character . Mary Chambers . I did not lie in that House that was broke open that Night , but I shut it up about ten o'Clock at Night , locked it , and took the Key away to my Master 's other House ; the People were all in Bed , and the Windows fast shut . I went there between six and seven in the Morning , and the Shutters next the Street were broke , and the Things laid in the Indictment were all missing . - The Prisoner frequently came to fetch Things from our Bakehouse . Abraham Foster . The 20th of July last , the Prisoner came to my Shop to be shaved ; after I had shaved him , I took the Wig out of the Box , to comb it out , and casting my Eye into the Work , I found it was the Wig I had made for John Chambers ; we searched his Lodgings , and found a Shirt which Mary Chambers proved to be her Work , and knew by its being made of two Sorts of Cloth . John Chambers . This Wig is mine , I lost it the 16th of May last ; the Prisoner said he bought the Wig in Rag-Fair , and if he had stole it he would not have worn it . Foster . You might have worn it seven Years , and not have been found out , if you had not brought it to my Shop . Prisoner . I bought them in Rag-Fair , I deal in old Cloaths . Mary Powel and Frances Holgate , knew him to deal in Rag-Fair , and gave him the Character of an honest industrious Fellow . Guilty Felony . Acquitted of the Burglary . [ Transportation .

August 8 . the Property of William Pantell . William Pantell . On Sunday , Aug. 8 , as I was selling my Milk , the Woman at the Bar came and snatched my Hat off my Head , and said I should not have it again , unless I would give her a Quartern . She said if I would come up Stairs with her , I should have my Hat ; and when I came up Stairs , she snatched my Watch from me . I thought when she took my Hat , she was in Jest , so I went a little farther to serve another Customer , before I demanded it . I have seen her before , as I have been selling Milk in the Street . - She lived in Love's-Court Shoe-Lane , it was about six o'Clock in the Evening . John Bannister . I was sitting upon the Bench ; and as he was pouring his Milk out of one Kettle into another , she snatched his Hat off his Head , and went up Stairs , and he went up Stairs too . I did not go up Stairs . John Banks , Constable . On Sunday , August 8 . I was sent for into Love's-Court , Shoe-Lane , about six o'Clock in the Evening , and this Boy and she , ( the Prisoner ) were up one Pair of Stairs , says he , Mr Banks , I have lost my Hat and my Watch ; said I to her , give him his Watch , but she would not give it him : The Boy said she had it in the Inside of her Shift , at her Back . So I felt for it and took it from her , it was the Inside of the back Part of her Stays , this is the Watch I took from her . Pantell . I bought it of one Pearce , under St Dunstan 's Church , I am sure this is the Watch she took from me . Prisoner . The young Man called for a Quartern of Gin , and after that a Quartern of Brandy . There was another young Man there , he went down and left us alone : He had no Money , so he said he would go and pawn the Watch ; but he gave me the Watch to pawn , and the Constable took it out of my Bosom . The Jury desired to know her Character . Banks . I believe she is a loose Woman . Court . Was there a third Person there ? Pantell .

Acquitted . 64. Thomas Griffiths was indicted , for that he , on the Ninth Day of July , not having God before his Eyes , and in the Parish of St Giles 's Cripplegate , in and upon Judith Haswell , Widow , with a certain large Piece of Brick , the said Judith Haswell on the upper Part of the Head did hit ; and gave her one mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch , and the Depth of half an Inch , of which said Wound the said Judith Haswell did die . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the Murder of Judith Haswell . Samuel Walton . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw a Piece of Brick at his Wife . - She asked him to go and carry Malt at the Peacock Brewhouse , he would not go ; but taking up a Piece of Brick , said if she was not easy , he would throw the Brick at her , which he did ; and then said he would throw another if she did not get away ; she said a good while unconcerned , but at Length the Neighbours got her away . * - She never went by any other Name than that of Griffiths . - The Brick was almost as big as my Fist . - He stood five or six Yards from her ; he bid her get away several Times , yet she would not go , and then he threw it at her with his Left Hand , it hit her pretty hard on the Head , and flew behind her . * The Breaks , in this and other Evidence , are to shew , that what follows is in Answer to Questions put to the Witnesses ; which Questions are omitted for Brevity sake , the Answers denoting what they were . Prisoner . Ask him if I did it designedly . Walton . To be sure he did , because he said he would , and did , throw it ; and he said if I say I will throw it , I will be as good as my Word . - I never knew any Harm of the Man before . - I think it was on a Thursday . Robert Rollison . I saw Thomas Griffiths and Judith Griffiths ( as I then thought , I did not know her Name was otherwise before ) go up Three Leg Court , in Whitecross-street , I think it was the eighth of July , it was on a Thursday . I did not see the Brick thrown , but I heard Words pass between the said Thomas Griffiths and his Wife ; he said , Damn your Blood , I will knock your Brains out if you do not get away . I will speak the Truth , for we must all appear before one Tribunal Judge , to be sure ; he said afterwards , God damn your Eyes and limbs , if I have not kill 'd you , I will kill you , and to be hanged for it I do not value it . I heard nothing else worth mentioning . Court . What was it she said to put him in such a Passion ? Rollison . She gave him very provoking Words I do assure you ; she damn 'd him for a Rogue in an illiterate Sort of a Way , for Ignorance and Impudence meet together , it mixes very much , and God will be a righteous Judge . Prisoner . That 's as true a Thing as ever was spoke in this World . Ask him if he did not say he would hang me . Rollison . My Soul , is that apparent . I shall always speak the Truth ; and if I say any thing amiss , I shall ask God 's Pardon , not your 's . I will say nothing to the Blemish of my Escutcheon . Court . Have you at any Time said that you would hang him ? Prisoner . I declare upon my Oath I never did . Margaret Allen . I saw him holl a Brick at the Woman , and saw the Blood come , - it was done with Violence , for it flew from her . - I do not know what Occasion was given for throwing it . - He was about 10 Yards from her - it was about half a Brickbat - I saw him have a second up in his Hand to throw at her , and he said after he had thrown one that he would do the same , for he did not value being hang 'd for such a Bitch as she was . - I believe she lived about 9 Days after this happened . Diana Brislet . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw a Brickbat at her Head , - it was thrown at her - I did not know her by any other Name than Judith Griffiths ; she went for his Wife ; he did take up a second Brickbat , and Mr White was the Man that took it from him , for he said , if he had struck her under the Burr of the Ear he might have killed her on the Spot ; the Prisoner said , Damn the Bitch he did not value being hanged for her , for if he did kill her he was sure he should be hanged for her . Charles Wheeler , Surgeon . The Wound she had was down to the Skull , about one Inch and an half long , and the Skull was bare , it was about the Middle of July , she came to my Surgery in Basing-hall Street , these Wounds are frequently healed , but I believe she caught Cold in coming in the Rain , and had a Fever , and that was the Occasion of her Death ; for the Membrane of the Brain was inflam 'd and that caused her Death ; she came to me for a Week , and I complained to the Church warden and said , she would die if she was not got into a better Place , it was for want of a warm Room and Necessaries , I believe , that was more the Occasion of her . Death than any thing else . Thomas Goodman , Surgeon . I attended the Deceased for two Days ; she had a large confused Wound on the upper Part of her Head : The Woman had no Symptoms of a fractured Skull , or any Injury done to the Brain when I attended her ; her Head and Neck were very much tumisied , and all I did prov 'd unsuccessful , the Humour was suddenly repelled and struck into her Brain : I believe she got Cold , as Mr Wheeler has said , and that was the Occasion of her Death . I do not think but that if she had not caught Cold , that the Wound might have been cured : I laid the Skull bare , and carefully examined it after she was dead , and I did not observe any Injury done to the Skull : Sometimes the Skull shall remain whole and there may be a Concussion of the Brain , I searched the Brain very carefully and it look 'd as in dead Bodies . Q . How can he be indicted for the Murder of Elizabeth Haswell , Widow , when the Witnesses say she was his Wife ? Rollison and Walton were called up again , and said they did not know her by any other Name than Griffiths . Mary Petts . I saw Judith Haswell before she departed her Life , and she said her Name was Judith Haswell ; and being asked , whether the Man was her Husband , she said no , and that the Man that gave her the Blow did not do it designedly , or with a design to do her any Damage , for he was in Liquor , and she had provoked him very much , and she desired he might not come to any Damage , for she should not rest in her Grave if he did . Another Witness said she heard the very same Words . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that there was some Malt came into the Peacock Brewhouse , and he went to pump some Water , that she came and rioted him very much , that he took it patiently till he could bear it no longer , and then he took up that Piece of Brickbat and hit her on the Head with it , but not with a Design to do her any Damage . Mary Griffiths . I am a small Relation , - but very little - I am his Aunt : I was Nurse in the Work-house where this Woman died : Her Name was Judith Haswell , she said she provoked him very much , and it was that Provocation occasioned is to be done , and she would not have him die for it for all the World . Rollison . That Woman that swore last is his own Mother , and she owned she was so . Court . You swore you was his Aunt ; there was no Crime in swearing you was his Mother , but there is a Crime in swearing you are his Aunt when you are his Mother . Mary Griffiths . I am his Mother indeed , but I am distracted , I do not know what I say . Judith Knight . I know the Prisoner was always a poor , harmless , inoffensive Fellow , but a little half-witted : She was a sad provoking Woman in Liquor , and would be both Master and Mistress : I was with her about two Days before she died ; and she desired it might not be laid to his Charge . Susan Baily , Elizabeth arlow , and Joseph Hughes gave him the Character of a Peaceable , harmless , honest , laborious Man . Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 65.

The best Part of my Linnen was in it ; I believe I lost a Dozen Shirts , tho ' I have laid but four in the Indictment . I was not at Home at the Time of this Fire . - I had a Suspicion of the Prisoner , because my Shop-Maid told me she found her at the Till the Day before , with a false Key . - When I came Home , I found my Bureau burnt up to the Well where the Money was ; then I missed these Pieces of Money , and charged the Prisoner with taking them .

I called out for a Light to the Prisoner , who was below , but she brought none , neither did she come up , but some other People came up with more Water . I did not go out of the Room till the Fire was out ; when the Fire was quite extinguished , I moved the Bureau from the Wall , for fear of it 's setting Fire to the Paper Hangings . Then several Neighbours came up , and a Candle was brought ; presently the Desk Part fell down , said I , this is surprizing , it has either been broke open , or was never locked . I looked at it , and the Bolt was shoved back . Soon after this , Mr. Pauncefort came Home . I told him what had happened , he said he had locked his Bureau in the Morning , and left his Money in it , and then he imagined that the Prisoner at the Bar had robb 'd him ; a Constable was sent for , and she was searched by the Constable ; but he did not find it upon her .

I went to Justice Jones and told him this , he said he would admit him an Evidence the next Morning , it being late then , which he did : He named the three Prisoners , Crocket and Emanuel Hubbard , I met Anderson and took him , and he said he believed his ( the Evidence 's ) Brother and Hinton , were at Mother Rippon 's at Epping : I hired some People and Horses , and went down and took them . Anderson and Studder would have made themselves Evidences , but Hinton did not care what became of himself if he could save Studder ; near the Place where I live there is about 60 of this Crew ; Studder , and the Keeper of New Prison 's Son , were the Leaders of this Gang ; we could hardly stir out of Doors for them .

This Lace was in my Box when they came into the Shop . I saw the Lace drop from Canwell . I had a Suspicion , because they bid me a great deal under the Value of it . Davis was at some small Distance from the Lace when it was taken off the Ground . Canwell . Have I not been several Times at your House , and laid out Money with you ? Coverley . She has been twice at my Shop , bought Goods and paid for them . Canwell . Did not Davis take the Lace , and put it upon me . Frances Coverley . I should rather think Davis took it ; I had never seen her before , she looked like an ill Person . - This is not the Lace they cheapened - I can not say Canwell handled any of the Lace , though she might , for the Box was close to each of them , - they stood even with one another . Elizabeth Smith ( Servant to Mr Crawley ) . These two Women came to my Master 's House , they were both sitting close together up Stairs . Davis got up , and one Part of the Lace stuck to Davis 's Cloaths , and the other Part lay upon the Ground . They said they knew nothing of the Matter . Gerrard Crawley .

Anne Young had known her twenty Years , Martha Foxon four Years , and Ann Jones , Susan Phillips , Mary Woolball , and James Woodward , have known Canwell several Years , and gave her the Character of a very honest Woman . Catherine Davis * guilty 4 s. 10 d. Jane Canwell acquitted . * Davis had not one Person to her Character , though she had a great many last Sessions , when she was tried by the Name of Mary Shirley , for robbing Mr Setcole , Linnen-Draper in Smithfield . See her remarkable Trial , No . 21 . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 91 , 92 , 93. John Cooper . John Squire , and John Jennings , were indicted ( together with James Stewart , and George Ewins , not yet taken ) for that they in a certain Place near the King 's Highway , called Grace 's Alley , upon Joseph Daniel , did make an Assault , and put him in corporal Fear , taking from him a wooden Box , sixteen Metal Spurs , one Cock , and thirty Shillings in Money , the Property of the said Joseph Daniel . Joseph Daniel . On the 27th of June last , I think it was between one and two in the Morning , I was going up Well-Street in Rosemary Lane , I turned into an Alley called Grace 's Alley , and heard , as I thought , some Body come after me , presently a Man came up with me , as soon as I could I stopped to let him pass before me ; then I saw several Persons , one of them came up to me , said he , what 's here ; ( I had a Fowl in my Bag ; ) let go . I had another Bag under my Arm , in which were these Spurs , and some trifling Things ; the Man that first stopped me , and took the Fowl , asked me what I had got in my Pockets , and put his Hand into my Breeches Pocket , on the right Side , and took my Money : To the best of my Knowledge , I lost 50 s. though I have laid it but for 30 s. I begged them not to use me ill , as I was a working Man , to hinder me from getting my Living ; one of them held up a Thing like a Pistol , and said he would blow my Brains out if I spoke another Word , or to that purpose ; another held up a Thing like a Hanger , but being very much frightened , I can not be very particular , then one of them said come along ; said I Gentlemen , here is in one of these Bags only a Fowl , which will be but of little Use to you , and upon my saying that , one of them flew towards me in a great Fury , and said , he would blow my Brains out if I said any more ; then I went away . - I can not take upon me to say I know any Thing of the Prisoners at the Bar : A Person came to me some time afterwards and asked me if I had lost any Cock Spurs ; I said yes I had , the Man told me he would go with me on Sunday to look after them . - 'T was Mr Unwin at the Ship , near Well Close-Square , the Spurs are in his Custody ; this wooden Box I am positive I lost , the Spurs were in it . - It was darkish , I can not be positive whether there were Lamps or not . Q . What sized Men were they ? Daniel . I took them to be middle sized Men , but I can not be positive . I am a Plaue-maker by Trade . Q . So you divert yourself now and then with a little Cock-Match . Daniel . I am a Man that does not use much Company , so I think I may as well spend a little Time that way , as spend two or three Shillings any where else . William Hawkins . On the 27th of June the three Prisoners at the Bar , and I and two more , met Joseph Daniel at the End of an Alley near Well-Close-Square . - We all went out together to stop any Body that we met , and to take what we could from them - It was between one and two o'Clock in the Morning . - I knew Mr Daniel again as soon as ever I saw him . Ewins the Irishman asked him what he had in his Bag , and took it from him , and put his Hand in his Pocket , he took out what Money the Gentleman had in his Pocket , which he said was 22 s. and 6 d. which was shared among us ; so he sunk the rest . - Squire was searching his Pockets too . I do not know what was taken out of the other Pocket . Q . Did any Body hold up a Pistol ? Hawkins . Squire had a short Rolling-pin , which might be taken for a Pistol in a Surprize . That young Fellow John Cooper had a Hanger , Squire took the Bag with the Box and Spurs in it . - The Gentleman desired to have his Fowl again , said he , there is nothing in that Bag but a Fowl , I hope you will give it me back again ; and John Cooper said if he spoke another Word he would cut off his Nose ; the Cock Spurs Squire and Cooper sold in Rag-Fair for 3 s. The Fowl was dressed at Mr Smith 's , the Yorkshire Grey in Rag-Fair , on Monday Morning , Squire , Cooper and I were at the eating of it , Jennings was not ; the 22 s. and 6 d. was divided between us , we had 3 s. and 6 d. a Piece , and the other 18 d. was spent in Bottled-Ale and Brandy . Jennings . I am sure of it , I never was out with them before that Night . Hawkins . We robb 'd five People that Night , and every one of the Prisoners were with me then . - I believe this is the Box the Spurs were in ; I took particular Notice of it . Jennings . Please to ask him how long he has known me . Hawkins . I never knew him before that Night ; all five except Jennings were together , and we said we were going out together , and asked Jennings to go along with us , and he said he would ; I had drank with the others several Times , but was never out with them before upon that Account . Jury . Was Jennings in the hearing of them ? Did he know of your Design , that you were to go out to rob ? Because there 's a Difference between taking a Walk , and going out a Robbing . Hawkins . The Irishman said , in the Hearing of Jennings , they were going out to rob any Body we met , and to get what we could . - I am sure Jennings heard him say so , and knew our Design . Samuel Unwin , who keeps the Ship Alehouse . I know of these Spurs , I have seven Pair and an odd one . After Mr Jones , the City-Marshal , had taken up these two Men , ( that is Cooper and Squire ) I heard of the Robbery in Well-Close-Square , and went to Miller , and he said they were sold to his Wife for Silver . I made an Enquiry of one at the Red-Lion Cock-Pit , whether he knew any Body who had been robbed of any Cock-Spurs ; upon that he made an Enquiry , and found them to be Mr Daniel 's . All Three guilty , Death . 94. Mary Mathews was indicted with John Johnson , not yet taken , for stealing one Guinea , one half Guinea , and a Quarter of a Moidore , and 6 s. and 6 d. in Money , the Property of Matth.ew Insom , August the 23d . Insom . A Fortnight ago last Monday , between seven and eight in the Morning , I was in Rag-Fair ; there was no Person in my Company but this Mathews , at a House which is called the Hay field ; I was drinking a Pint of Beer , there she picked me up , and carried me to one Johnson 's , who keeps a private House : We drank together , but I refused drinking any thing but all Ale . We were in a Room by ourselves ; as soon as I came out of the House I missed my Money . I was not there passing half an Hour - I know I had my Money in my Pocket a Quarter of an Hour before I came out of the House ; and in half an Hour 's Time I met her in my Way . - I am sure she is the Person that robbed me . I carried her before Justice Richards , and she pleaded she had not a Halfpenny Piece about her . And the Money was found about her there was a Guinea , and 10 s. 3 d. Joseph Goadby . I found 31 s. 3 d. in her Pocket , though she said she had not a Farthing . Acquitted . 95 , 96. Ralph Coster , and Thomas Coster , of the Parish of St Mary Islington , in the County of Middlesex , Labourers , were indicted , for that they not having God before their Eyes , but being moved and seduced by the Instigation of the Devil , on the 16th Day of August , in the Sixteenth Year of His Majesty 's Reign , in and upon the Body of John Lack , feloniously did make an Assault with a cert ain Dagger made of Iron and Steel , value 6 d. which he , the said Ralph , held in his Right-hand , and him the said John one mortal Wound did give , of the Breadth of half an Inch , and the Depth of 3 Inches , of which Wound he instantly died : And that the said Thomas Coster was then and there aiding , abetting , assisting , comforting and maintaining the said Ralph the said Murder to commit : And that they the said John Lack did kill and murder against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , & c . Josias Lack . The Deceased was my Father : He was killed the 16th Day of last August , in the Road leading from Aldersgate-Street to Islington , near the Turnpike . - The next Day we got a Search-Warrant , and went with the High Constable to the Turk's-Head Alehouse , in the Road leading to Islington . I asked where the Landlord and Landady were ; a Woman said , I am Landlady . The Constable and other Officers searched the House , to see if they could find any Weapon wherewith the Murder was committed . Q . How came you to go to this House ? Josias Lack . Because it was a House of an indifferent Character , and People suspected it : The High-Constable was going there before I saw him . Says the High-Constable to the Woman , Where is your Husband ? Says she , he is in the Country , he has been gone three Weeks . - I have no Lodgers ; there is no body in the House but my Son , and he is making a Perriwig : She would have called him down , but the Constable chose to go up ; and when he came up , the Son was mending a Coat , and the Father was shut up in a Closet . There was a Shirt lay soaking in Water , which was bloody : I believe it was in a Bason in the Room where the Father was . The Son was in another Room up two pair of Stairs . It was asked , How the Shirt came to be bloody ; and the old Woman , and all of them said , the old Man was blooded the Sunday before . - They all three said so : And when they came before the Justice , the old Man and his Son both said it was the Sunday was se'ennight before . The Shirt was brought down and looked at , and it was bloody only on the right Arm . Court . Did you look at the Arm that was bloody ? - Lack . There was a Barber there that did , and he said he had not been blooded so lately as the Sunday se'ennight before . - I did not see any Thing farther than an old Orisice : - It looked white , not red ; he seemed very much frightened , but said , he would send for the Man that blooded him , but I did not see him there . Q . Did you see the Body of your Father ? Josias Lack . Yes , there was a great deal of Violence done to him , he was very much abused ; he had thirteen or fourteen Wounds , they appeared to be Stabs . There was one on his Left-side , under his Left-Pap ; one in his Throat ; one under his Right-Ear ; one in his Left-Cheek ; another by his Left-Eye ; another in his Left-Arm , and one or two in his Back . - It was about 10 o'Clock at Night on Monday , Aug . 16 . He worked at the Tower , and was going home to Islington . I was called out about 11 o'Clock , and the Body lay in the Road about six or seven hundred Yards from the Turnpike . - He had no Wound on the Right-Arm . Court . You say , the old Man said he would send for the Person that blooded him . Did he send ? Josias Lack . He said he would ; and that the Person lived on Little Saffron-Hill , by Hockley in the Hole : but he did not come . Ralph Coster . Did not I send for the Barber ? My own Daughter went for him , and brought him ; and you staid so long in the Mulberry-Garden , that he went away again . Lack . I did not see any body sent for . John Noel . On Tuesday the 17th of August , the High-Constable sent for me to get a Search-Warrant from Justice Wroth , to search Houses who harbour People of bad Reputation . The first House we went into was the Turk's-Head ; the Prisoner at the Bar kept the Turk's-Head at that Time ; when we went in , the Woman was asked , Who kept the House : Then she was asked where her Husband was , she said , he had been out of Town three Weeks or a Month . The High-Constable asked her , if she had got any Lodgers , or any body else in the House . She said , there was no body in the House but her Son , and that he was above Stairs , making of a Perriwig . The High-Constable bid her call him down , and she said she would ; but before she called him down , said one of the Constables , let us go and see what he is doing of ; so I went up Stairs : he was at work , but I can not tell whether it was upon a Perriwig or a Coat . Then Mr Body , the next Witness , said , here is a Man in the Closet . The Door was shut to , and I thought it was a Door that went into another Room , and there the old Man was bolt upright in the Closet - It had no Window , but was big enough to put a Close-stool , or a two-armed Chair in ; and Mr Body pulled him out , and then somebody searched to see if there were any Weapons , but did not find any ; there was a Shirt in a Pan or a Bason of Water , or Urine : I have got the Shirt here . It was the Left-Arm then that appeared to be bloody , for the Shirt was turned . I did not see it when it was taken out of the Pan ; it was delivered me before the Justice . N. B . The Shirt was produced , and appeared to be bloody about half way up the Sleeve for the Right-Arm . Q . When the Shirt was produced , how did they behave ? John Noel . The old Man seemed to be very much frightened , and said , he had been blooded the Sunday before , and that the Shirt was put in Water to soak the Blood out . - I do not know whether the Arm was inspected at the House . Thomas Coster . The Arm was inspected at the House . John Noel . I saw the Arm stripped before the Justice . There did not appear to me to be any thing of a new Orisice ; when he was examined before the Justice , he said it was the Sunday was se'en-night before that he was blooded ; he said the Person that blooded him was a Barber , who lived on Saffron-Hill . Court . Explain yourself as to the Father 's being frightened . Noel . He seemed to be in a Flurry , as if he did not know what he said . Q . How did the young Man behave ? Noel . He said he knew nothing at all of the Matter , and said he would go very quietly with us . Q . Did you observe in the young Man any Signs of Guilt ? Noel . I did not perceive any Timidity in him , there was in the old Man . Ralph Coster . Ask him what I said , when they took me out of the Closet . Noel . I did not take you out of the Closet . R. Coster . Did not I show my Arm then ? Noel . I did not see it . Court . Lack , Was your Father stripped ? Josias Lack . My Father was not stripped , he was robbed - of a Tobacco-Box , an old Knife , and a Key ; and I believe he had about him , between twenty and thirty Shillings , which was lost . Noel . The Justice desired us to try who the Shirt would fit , and it was tried on the old Man 's Wrist , and it would not meet by half an Inch at least , I believe it would hardly meet with a Pair of Buttons . Coster . These are the Buttons I had in the Sleeves when I wore it . Noel . There were no Buttons produced before the Justice : He said there , the Shirt was given him by a Nephew , and he had only wore it that Day ; and that it was to be altered and made fit for him . - There is no Mark at all upon it - The Son said he was a Perriwig Maker by Trade . - There were two or three Razors in the Room , and two or three Staves that they weave their Hair upon . - It looked as if it had been a Room that a Barber had made use of , but not lately , for the Things did not stand in Order for working . William Body . I went with a Search-Warrant , by the High Constable 's Order , to the Turks-Head . Said the High-Constable , Body , come in along with me . Said he to a Woman that was there , Who keeps this House ? Said she , I do . He asked who was in the House , she said I have no Body in the House but my son , and he is at Work . - I did not hear her ask 'd where her Husband was . I went first into the one Pair of Stairs Room on the Left-Hand and found nothing ; and then into the one Pair of Stairs Room on the Right-Hand . I went into the other Room again , and saw a Button to a Closet-Door , which was not buttoned . I went to open the Door , but I believe he held it within , because it did not open immediately . Q . Was there any thing on the inside , by which he might hold it ? William Body . It was a common Wainscote framed Door , and a Body might lay hold of the Frame with one 's Finger . - I believe it was plain on the Inside . - I did not see any thing of the Inside , that it might be hold by , - it might stick a little . My Lord , when I opened it , there was a Man stood upright in the Closet ; said I , What do you do here ? Come out . - I was led a little , for I had no Stick nor any Weapon . The old Man said , I am afraid of Bailiffs , that is the Reason of my hiding myself , I am afraid of nothing else . His Shoes were slipped , - they took the old Man down Stairs . - The young Man was mending a Coat , and he said , My Mother keeps the House , I am not afraid of any thing , What is the Meaning of this ? Said they , there is a Murder committed , and this is a Search-Warrant , and you must go along with us ; said he , I will follow you down . I thought it best that he should go first , and he readily did so . - The Sleeve of the Shirt lay in a Bason of Water , and the Body lay out of it . The High-Constable said it was requisite to take the Shirt along with us , so I went up Stairs and fetched it down . Q . How did the old Man behave then ? William Body . I did not see him any more surprized when he saw the Shirt than he was before . At first he said he was blooded the Sunday before , so did his Wife , and so did his Daughter . - His Arm was stripped up before the Justice , and there was a Man that came from Islington that bleeds People , and he said he was sure he had not been blooded for a great while . Jury . Did you hear that the Person that blooded him had been at the Justice 's ? Body . I did hear it said , that the Surgeon that blooded him , had been at the Justice 's , and that he was gone , but I did not see him . R. Coster . I know no more of it than the Child unborn . This is the Barber that blooded me . Joseph Chandler . I am a Barber , and Perriwig-Maker , and Bleeder . On the 8th of August , that old Gentleman at the Bar came to me to Saffron Hill , to be blooded , between eight and nine in the Morning , and I blooded him in the Right-Arm . Q . Did you go before the Justice ? Chandler . I was informed , that I was sent for twice , but I was abroad . Q. I would ask you if a Man has been let Blood eight or ten Days , whether the Orifice will look red or white ? Chandler . Sometimes it will look red for a Fortnight ; sometimes it may hardly be seen at all , but will close immediately ; sometimes it will be three or four Days , and in eight or nine Days it will look as if it was an old Bleeding . I knew the old Man before he lived there , he kept a House at the Spaw . Ralph Coster . I have Witnesses to prove that my Son and I were in Bed that Night by nine o'Clock . But the Court and Jury being satisfied , they were not examined . Acquitted . 97 , 98. Mary Swinhy and Jane Biller , of St George 's Middlesex , were indicted with Mary Merrit , not yet taken , for assaulting Winifred Owen on the King 's High-Way , putting her in Fear , and taking from her a Handkerchief , an Apron , a Hat , and 17 s. in Money , her Property , Aug. 15 . Winifred Owen . I sell Milk . Last Sunday was three Weeks , between nine and ten in the Morning , as I was going homeward , towards Stepney , in Rag-Fair , I think they call it , I met with these Women , and asked them the Way to the Blue Anchor , they said they would show me : We went about three or four Stones throw together ; then they shoved me into an Alley , and gave me a Blow on the Head . Prisoner Miller . Gentlemen , I desire they may be all turned out of Court , and examined seperately , which was granted . Owen . The Blow stunned me , ( she is not taken that gave me the Blow , there were five of them ) then I said , Lord , have Mercy upon me , What is this for . I clapped my Hand upon my Pocket in a Minute , and caught that little one 's Hand ( Miller 's ) in my Pocket . Said I , Lord , bless me , all my Money is gone ; then one snatched my Apron off , and another my Handkerchief , and another snatched my Hat ; the 17 s. in Money was tied up in a Rag . Miller . My Lord , please to ask her whether she was drunk or sober . Owen . I drunk ! I thought I should have been murdered . God keep me from such People . So I run away , crying , into a little House , for to save my Life . I went to my Sister , and told her of it , who lives just by ; and some of the People said , they knew that little short Body , and she was taken up directly . I went to the Watch House , and they asked me if I knew her ? Yes , said I , that is the Woman that put her Hand in my Pocket . Said I , What have you done with my Money ? She cursed and swore , and abused me sadly , and struck me before the Justice . I thought she would have killed me , and the Justice ordered her to be tied down . My Handkerchief was found upon her . Q . Are you sure Swinhy was there ? Owen . Yes and please you , my Lord , God bless you , I know her very well ; the little one had a black Eye then ; 't is pretty well now : That Handkerchief is mine , I worked very hard for it , and that Hat and Apron are mine . Miller . Ask her if she did not ask for a Dram , and if I did not resent her having one . Owen . I did not call for any Liquor , God bless you , and please you , my Lord , it is she , if I was to die this Minute , God bless you . - That Woman in the blue Knot , [ which was Swinhy ] she was in Company , but I can not say she did what the others did ; - She did not take any thing from me . - I am sure the little one robbed me ; God Almighty bless you , I would not tell a Lye for the World : They snatched behind me , and did it so quick , I can not tell who did it . Joseph Williams , Constable . I was charged with this Woman to carry her to Prison ; this Hat , Apron , and Handkerchief were delivered me before the Justice . Thomas Butler . The Prosecutrix came to my House , I am her Sister 's Husband , and sat about Half an Hour one Sunday in the Morning . - Some time after she went away , I met her full butt between nine and ten , she was crying , and said she had been robbed by four Women , two small ones , a lusty one , and a middle sized one : I heard a Man say he saw four or 5 Women together talking about dividing some Money ; I happen 'd to go into the Black-Horse , in Well-Street , and there I saw Jane Miller ; she was selling the Handkerchief ; then I took fast hold of her , and she put the Handkerchief into her Bosom , then I took her to the Watch-house , and charged Williams the Officer with her ; he kept her in Custody , and then Eleanor Okley was taken , and she made her self an Evidence : Swinhy was taken up upon her Evidence by Inwin and Harris : A Woman came to me with the Apron and Hat , and said , I had these from the Woman that took them from your Sister-in-Law . - I saw Miller take the Handkerchief out of her Bosom , and gave it to another Woman , and that Woman gave it to me : When Swinhy was taken , she said , she was along with them when they went to sell the Goods , but she had no Hand in the Robbery . - Jane Miller told me , she did not drink any Gin in the Prosecutrix 's company . Owen . I drank no Gin with them that Morning , nor never saw them before in my Life . Miller . Pray , Sir , did not he pull me all along ? Williams . I bid him pull you along because you would not go . Eleanor Okley . Jane Miller , Mary Swinhy , Mary Merrit , and myself , went one Sunday Morning to get a Dram at the New Exchange in Rag Fair , and we happened to meet this good Woman , the Prosecutrix , and she asked for the Blue-Anchor . Jane Miller made answer , come along with us and we will show you , we all four of us went along with her ; when we came into the back Lane , Jane Miller , first and foremost took off her Hat ; secondly , she took off her Handkerchief , which was upon her Neck . Mary Merrit gave the Woman the Blow on the side of her Head , then Jane Miller was trying to take off her Apron ; then Mary Merrit came again , and between them both they untied it , and then we all run away . - I did not see any Body put their Hand into her Pocket - as for the Money I know nothing of it , nor never saw any ; I had no intent to rob any Body when I went out in the Morning , and I believe they had not neither - we drank no Gin with the good Woman , we had Gin before . Jury . Were you sober , or were you in Liquor ? Okley . We were not in Liquor , for we had but Half a Quartern a-piece . Swinby was with us , but she did nothing . - I went and left them , and heard no more of it till Miller was in the Cage . - Miller put the Handkerchief into her Bosom , the Hat and Apron Mary Merrit had . Miller . Ask her if she was not at Mrs Bun 's drinking Gin with the Prosecutrix . Eleanor Okley . I did not drink any thing with the Prosecutrix ; I was not in any House with her . Miller 's Defence . I was going down Rag-Fair , Okley stood at the End of an Alley with Mary Merrit , they asked me to go to the New Exchange to drink a Dram ; then I met the Prosecutrix , Okley took hold of her , said she , you shall drink a Dram , she said she did not care for a Dram for she had drank enough already : This Woman [ that 's Swinby ] and Bun 's Daughter , went after the Woman , and brought her into a Gin-shop ; then Swinby was sitting with her Mistress 's Child upon her Lap : I being a little Body like Eleanor Okley , they swear against me : Okley put her Hand in her Pocket and took out only seven Farthings , said I who must pay for the five Quarters of Gin ; and then I took her Handkerchief off her Neck to pay for it : Okley made herself an Evidence against me , for fear I should be an Evidence against her ; but I had no such Intention , because I knew it was a wrong thing . Okley . I do not know that Miller said any thing to the Prosecutrix , when she took the Handkerchief , that she did it to pay herself for five Quarterns of Gin . Jane Miller , guilty of the Felony , but acquitted of the putting in Fear . Mary Swinby Acquitted . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 99.

Edward Rhodes Aris , of St John Wapping , was indicted , that he , with William McBride , not yet taken , did steal and carry away , twenty-nine Pieces of Foreign Gold Coin , called Moidores , out of a certain Ship called the Archibald , the Property of Persons unknown , July 23 . Mr Crawford ( the Owner of the Ship ) produced an Examination taken by Justice Dennet , and signed by the Prisoner , wherein he says that William Mc Bride brought a Box on Shore , which was very heavy , and had a great deal of Gold in it , and that he gave this Examinant thirty-five Moidores of the Money . The Indictment being laid for stealing them , which could not be proved , he being at most only guilty of receiving them , knowing them to be stole , he was acquitted . 102. William Bird , late of the Parish of St Martin in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , Labourer , was indicted , for that he on the Sixteenth Day of July , in the Sixteenth Year of his Majesty 's Reign , about the Hour of two in the Morning of the said Day , with Force and Arms , in and upon one Mary the Wife of John Maurice , did feloniously , wilfully , and with Malice aforethought , make an Assault ; and that he , the said William Bird , into a certain Close-Room , called the Hole , being Part of the Building belonging to St Martin 's Round-House , she said Mary Maurice , with Malice aforethought , did force , put , place , confine , and continue for the Space of two Hours , where there were twenty Persons confined , which said Room was not of sufficient Largeness to contain twenty Persons , for the Space of one Hour , without manifest Danger of their Lives ; and that the said Mary Maurice , during the Time of her Consinement , on the Day and Year aforesaid , in the Parish and County aforesaid , and in the said Close-Room , was suffocated ; and that the said Mary Maurice , in the said Close-Room aforesaid , did die ; and that he , the said William Bird , in Manner and Form aforesaid , with Malice aforethought , the said Mary Maurice did kill and murder . He was likewise charged on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the Murder of Mary Maurice . The Prisoner desired Pen , Ink , and Paper , which was granted . The Court likewise ordered his Irons to be taken off . Bird . If your Honour pleases , I would not enter immediately into the Trial , but would desire an Hour 's Time . I am prepared with Innocence , but my Friends are not all come . [ The Trial was put off for an Hour ; when being again brought to the Bar . ] Bird . There is one Favour I beg of you , Sir John , that this poor unhappy Woman , my Wife , may have Egress and Regress . Court . She shall , and no Body shall insult either her or your Witnesses . Bird . Another Thing I beg is , that the Evidences may be examined separate . ( Which was ordered ) [ Bird then applied himself to Mr Lloyd , one of the King 's Council . ] Mr Lloyd . You will have no Hardship from any Body here . Bird . It 's hard I can have no Council ; Serjeant Hayward is out of Town ; Serjeant Wynne is out of Town ; Mr Benny and Mr Theed desired to be excused . Mr Glanville has given his Brief to one Mr Spiltimber , and he has returned it . King 's Council . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury . I am Council with the Gentleman who open 'd the Indictment against the unhappy Prisoner at the Bar , and you find that the Crime , with which he is charged , is of no less a Size than the heinous one of Murder . It falls to my Share to lay before you the particular Facts on which that heavy Charge is grounded , which I will choose to do with all the Plainness I can possibly use , and without any Comments or Observations upon them , 'till I have open 'd the whole , that so the naked Story may be considered by you in one uninterrupted Light , and the Application of the several Facts to our Law arising upon them , may be the more clearly understood . I always look 'd on Plainness to be the best , or however the honestest , Eloquence ; putting false Colours on Facts is ever unjust , but in Cases where wretched Men are on their Trial at the hazard of their Lives , 't is not only unjust but cruel ; and as the Case now to be laid before you is stated to me in my Instructions , were I ever so desirous and able to use colouring , the Facts are too black of themselves to admit of any additional Horror . Gentlemen , the Prisoner at the Bar has lived some Time in a Place called the Round-House , in St Martin's-Lane ; and has for a considerable Time ( some Years ) acted as a sort of Goaler , and disposed of such Persons as were brought thither in such Manner as he thought proper ; this Round-House consists of several Rooms . On the 16th of July last , very early in the Morning , a Number of People were brought at different Times to this Round-House , I suppose by proper Officers , amongst which the poor unfortunate Woman , whose Death gives you the Trouble of this Day , was one . - Many of them were , as they were brought thither , put by the Prisoner into a Place called the Hole , being under Ground , and about six Foot six Inches in Length , six Foot three or four Inches in Breadth , and about the same Dimensions in Height : I am instructed to say that some who thought proper to spend Money in the House , or to purchase Beds , had more Indulgence than the others , how that Fact may come out I ca n't say ; the Common-Sewer runs underneath Part of this Hole ; towards the Street was an Iron Grate which let in some Light and Air , to which there was a Shutter to be put to on Occasion , and through which were several little Slits where some little Air might come when the Shutter was put to , and there was likewise a cut over the Door which served to let in Light and Air ; the Closeness of the Place , and the Stench within it , caused by its Situation , and by the Increase of the Number of People put in at different Times , occasioned a general Cry of Murder from the poor Wretches within it , they begg 'd for Water , for Air ; called out that several were in Fits , but without Relief ; the Clamours of their Complaints reach 'd the Prisoner 's Ears , but not his Heart , for my Instructions lead me to say , that he not only refused Relief himself , but hindred others who would have afforded it ; for as a Woman was coming to bring them some Water , he push 'd her away , spilt the Water , and took away the little Resource of Air which they had , by closing the Shutter - three more Women were brought to the Round-House , and the Prisoner order 'd the Beadle to carry them into this Hole , but on his Return from it , he told the Prisoner that 't was impossible , that the Hole was too full already , and that if they had not more Air they would die . The Prisoner immediately carried the three Women down himself , and on his Return , told the Beadle , what you said could not be done , I have done in a Minute ; soon after the Prisoner went to his Bed , and this Hole was no more open 'd , till ten in the Morning , and when it was open 'd 't is impossible to describe to you the dismal Scene ! Some gasping , and , to Appearance , expiring ; some recovered who were taken for dead or dying , by the Aid of the Surgeons ; others expired on the opening a Vein , and the poor Woman , for whose Death this Prosecution is carried on , was quite dead . Having thus briefly and plainly open 'd to you the Nature of the Facts , which my Instructions lead me to say will be proved by the Witnesses , I shall take up but a little more of your Time by a few Observations , and which I shall submit to the Direction of the Court . Two Things are necessary to constitute the Crime called Murder ; first , an unlawful killing ; secondly , a malicious Intent at the Time of committing it . And here you 'll observe , that I am supposing the Facts to be true , as I have opened them , for if the Witnesses do not prove them , all that I shall say , or have said , ought to pass for nothing . First then , As to the unlawful killing , I always took it , that the Constable is the proper Officer to confine Persons committed or carried to the Round-House ; and I am informed , that the Prisoner was not properly a Constable , and if so , then most certainly all he did was unlawful ; but as he has acted for a considerable Time in this Capacity , and has been deemed the Officer , perhaps it would be too hard in this capital Way , to take Advantage of the Want of Legality in his Office . I will therefore suppose him the proper Goaler , I will suppose the Persons lawfully committed to his Custody , I will suppose all legal to the Time of putting them in the Hole , and yet it will appear that the killing was unlawful . The End of all Commitments to Round-Houses is , that the Prisoners should be safely kept for the Examination of a proper Magistrate , they are there , as in all other Prisons , in the Custody of the Law , they are sent thither to be preserved for a proper Judicatory , not to be destroyed ; and the Goaler is by Law obliged to treat his Prisoners with all the Care , and Tenderness too , which is fitting and possible . The Law abhors Cruelty , and has an Officer of its own , the Coroner , to enquire into the Death of Prisoners , left they should have met their Fate by cruel Treatment ; in which Case , the Law adjudges the Goaler guilty of Murder : He , by Force of the Law , is to keep , not to destroy his Prisoners ; supposing therefore , this poor Woman lawfully in the Custody of the Prisoner ; yet , if the Facts opened shall be proved to you , she died unlawfully , so that in such Case , here is the first Thing requisite , an unlawful killing . The second Ingredient in Murder , is a malicious Intent at the Time of committing it . Malice and Hatred are very different Things : Hatred is a Temper of Mind antecedent to the Fact ; but Malice may be a sudden Intent , and expressed at once ; thus killing another on a sudden Quarrel , with a dangerous Weapon , is Murder , for the Weapon shews the malicious Intent . In several Acts the Law implies Malice ; but in this Case there is no Occasion for implied Malice , for the Acts shew express Malice ; if he heard their Cries , or was told by the Beadle of the Danger , Why no Relief ? To what else can be imputed one Expression of his , which I am instructed be used , Let them die and be damned . Thus , Gentlemen , I have gone through what I proposed ; the Man is to be tried by you ; to your Judgment and Impartiality the Evidence to be given must be submitted . You will try him by Witnesses , not by Words ; and judge of his Guilt or Innocence , not from what we say within , or others without , but from what shall be sworn here ; and if we who prosecute fail in Proof , God forbid the Man should suffer ; but if the Facts are proved , surely the Prisoner can not have any just Claim to your Pity . Other Murders admit of some Circumstances of Palliation , from Provocation , - sudden Rage , - false Notions of Honour , and the like ; but if the Man is guilty here , What Compassion can he be entitled to from you , who shewed none to his Fellow-Creatures . [ Sarah Bland sworn . ] Council . Pray did you know Mary Maurice ? Bland . Yes , she was the Wife of John Maurice . Q . Were you taken up at any Time ? tell us where , and when . Bland . Mary Maurice and I were taken up some Time in July , about a quarter of an Hour after Eleven at Night , and carried to St Martin 's Round-House . Q . What did Mr Bird do to you there ? Bland . We had not sat down more than the Space of four or five Minutes in the Fore-Room above Stairs , but Mr Bird came to me , and took me by the Shoulder , and bid me go down Stairs . Said he , Madam , go down these Stairs ; and Mary Maurice said to him , let me go along with my Cousin ; and she went along with me into the Hole . Q . How many People were there in the Hole , when you went down there ? Bland . There were about twelve or fourteen People . Q . How many more were put into the same Place ? Bland . There were in all about twenty-four . Bird . I ask Pardon for interrupting . I think the Question asked , is , What Time they were put down into the Hole , for my Life depends upon it . Bland . It was about a quarter of an Hour after Eleven ; and we were kept there till Ten in the Morning ; I was vastly hot , and cried out Murder ; and so did almost every Body that was there ? Q . What Time was it you found it so hot ? Bland . About one o'Clock ; and it was very hot about four o'Clock . I begged for some Water , but Mr Bird made no Answer to that . That Man was there , I believe he was the Beadle , and Mr Bird said he could not stand to talk there . Bird . Please to take Notice , there was an Answer made her by the Beadle . Court . No , she does not say any such thing . Bland . I begged for a little Air , and in order to get some , I told Mr Bird there was a Woman in Labour , and that some were in Fits , and that there were two a dying . Q . What did he say to that ? Bland . He said they might die and be damned . Bird . What Hour was that ? Bland . I believe it was not five o'Clock in the Morning . Court . What State of Health was Mary Maurice in , when she went down into the Hole ? Bland . She was very well then ; but about four or five o'Clock , she was very light-headed , and said to me , Cousin , let me die , let me die , for God 's Sake . She laid her Head upon my Lap for some Time ; and her Head dropped off my Lap , she sunk down and I saw her no more afterwards , I was in a Fit myself . There was a Woman came with a Quartern of Gin to some Prisoner there , but I can not tell who it was for . Q . What Time was this ? Bland . It was before the Hole was shut up , I believe it was before five o'Clock in the Morning . That the Woman came to the Grate ; she had a Quartern-Pot in her Hand ; she said there was Gin in the Pot , and that she was going to give it to one of the Prisoners ; and Mr Bird , by Force , shoved her away , spilt the Liquor , and broke the Glass . - He called her Bitch , and bid her get away from the Window , so the Woman went away and I never saw her afterwards . Soon after Mr Bird came with a Padlock and padlock 'd the Window himself . - It is a Shutter with Iron Bars a-cross , and long Holes cut in it , to let the Light through . Q . Was it opened before the Watchman broke it open about ten o'Clock in the Morning ? Bland . I do not know that . Q . What further do you know of this Matter ? Bland . There was Murder and Fire called ; there was a Woman brought a Pipe , such as People smoak Tobacco in , and went to the Ale-House and got some Beer , and poured it into the Bowl of the Pipe , and we sucked it through the small End of the Pipe , which was put through the Holes of the Shutter , and some Body came and pushed the Woman and broke the Pipe , so we could not get any more . Q . You say there was a cry of Murder and Fire , what did no Body come to your Assistance ? Bland . No , no Body . There were four or five in Fits in the Hole , but it being dark I could not tell who were dead and who were alive . Court . Mr Bird , if you have any Questions to propose to this Witness ask them . Bird . Please to ask her what Time in the Morning her Kinswoman died , with her Head in her Lap . Court . She did not say she died with her Head in her Lap . Bird . I will venture to say she said her Head was in her Lap about two or three o'Clock , and then she died . Bland . She said , let me lay my Head in your Lap and let me die ; but I do not know when she died . Bird . Sir John , I am more afraid of my Reputation than I am of my Life . - Ask her whether she has not made Oath that Mary Maurice died between two and three o'Clock . Bland . I never did declare any such Thing . Bird . Ask her whether the Door or Shutter was shut to murder these People , or only to keep them from being drunk , in order to be carried before that Gentleman [ Colonel Deveil ] to answer the High-Constable . Bland . To be sure he could not be off of knowing our Distress , for he said , Die and be damned ; and there was room enough in the House ; whether he heard any Complaint or Cry of Murder , or their being afraid of losing their Lives , whether he heard my Voice , or made any Repartee to it , I can not tell ; but I heard his Voice , and saw him come down several Times with Prisoners . Bird . Did you ever know me to be such a cruel wicked Dog , as to kill five or six of your Sex ? Bland . No , I can not say that . Bird . I should be a cruel Dog if I had . Bland . He might have relieved us , for there was Room in the House ; there was an old Woman who gave him Six-pence not to be locked down with us , what her Name is I can not tell . Q . How many Rooms were there ? Bland . There were three Rooms in all , that I saw ; there is another Hole besides this , for the Men . Jury . Were those Rooms full ? Bland . They were not full . There were some that paid for their Beds ? Bird . Who paid for their Beds ? Bland . I do not know who they were . Bird . Do you know of one Amey 's striking and assaulting me , and knocking my Candle out of my Hand ? Speak plainly , speak the Truth . Bland . This Elizabeth Amey , insisted on going up Stairs to pay her Reckoning , and Mr Bird gave her a Push and her Cap came off : I did not see any Body strike him ; nor do I know any thing of the Candle 's being knocked out . - You had a Candle in your Hand . Bird . Was I drunk or sober ? Bland . I do not know . Bird . I happen 'd to be entirely sober that Night . Q . You say Mary Maurice went down of her own accord ; did she desire to come back again ? Bland . Yes she did ; and she cried out for Air and for Water . Q . Was she brought in by any Officer ? Bland . She was brought in along with me . Q . What Time did she desire to be let out ? Bland . I believe it was between three and four o'Clock in the Morning . Q . Do you know of whom she asked to be let out ? Bland . She ask 'd Mr Bird , anso did a great many more besides her ; and when Mr Bird came down with more Prisoners , she said , For God 's sake , Mr Bird , let us have some Air or some Water to relieve us , or take some of us away , and put us in another Place . Q . What did he say then ? Bland . He said he would give us no relief at all - he did say so indeed , I am sure he said so . Q . What House was you and Maurice brought from ? Bland . No House at all , we were taken up by the Porto Bello , just by the Round-House . Q . What sort of a Woman was Mary Maurice , was she short or tall , fat or slender ? Bland . She was of a middling Size , a little inclinable to be Dropsical . Q . Who put you into the Hole ? Bland . I am certain Mr Bird was the Person who had the Key , opened the Door , and put us down ; he took me by the Shoulder and shoved me down Stairs . Q. Robert Churchman , Do you know a place called the Hole belonging to St Martin 's Round-House ? Churchman . I am a Carpenter ; I was sent for to measure it ; you go up four Stone Steps into the Round-House , and this Place is below these Steps : The Height of it is six Foot two Inches ; the Length and Breadth six Foot six , by six Foot two ; the Window is two Foot six , by one Foot six ; there are some Iron Bars , but no Glass , there is a Shurter which puts up with three Slits , about a Quarter of an Inch wide , and about 18 Inches long ( but I never measured it ) ; there is a Door to the Passage leading to the Hole , and opens into the Hole , two Foot wide , the Door does not go up to the Top by nine Inches or there abouts , and there is another Room for the Men which is eight Foot five , by six Foot three , and there is a Passage nine Foot three by four Foot ten , which leads from the Women 's Hole to the Men 's Hole ; and there is a Door at the Head of the Stairs . - If the Hole had been left open the Prisoners would have been secure by the Door at the Top of the Stairs , but then the Men and the Women might have gone to o another , which is not customary . [ Robert Bus hel , Beadle of St. Martin 's , sworn . ] Q . Do you remember the Time that a Number of Women were brought into the Round-House ? Bushel . Yes ; it was the 16th Day of July last . Q . Do you know what Time any of them began to be brought in ? Bushel . They began to be brought in about eleven o'Clock , and none were brought in after four . Q . Do you know what Time the Deceased Mary Maurice or Sarah Bland were brought in ? Bushel . No ! there were so many of them that I can not tell their Names . - I was there all Night . Q . Do you know how many People were put into the Hole that Night ? Bushel . I believe there was about twenty People in all ? Q . Do you remember three Women being put down into the Hole ? Bushel . I was ordered to put three Women into the Hole by the Prisoner at the Bar , it was about five o'Clock in the Morning , before the Constable went away . I opened the Door of the Hole , and saw the Hole was so full that I did not think it reasonable to put any more in : - There is no Lock to it , only two Bolts . Q . What Condition were the People in then ? Bushel . They seemed to be pretty much crowded , but did not cry out : said I to Mr. Bird , if you put them in you will stifle them ; but if you bolt the upper Door , and open the Door of the Hole , there will be room enough for them : Mr Bird ran down pretty hastily , and put them in ; and when he came up again , he said , Bushel , I have put them in in a Minute , though you would not put them in . Q . Did you think there was any Danger in doing it ? Bushel . I did it out of Compassion to these poor Creatures . Jury . Did you hear any of these poor Creatures cry out for Help ? Bushel . No , I did not indeed ; I did not hear any Outcry all Night , and I staid till five o'Clock , though four was our Hour to go away . Q . Did you hear any cry of Murder ? Bushel . No , I did not , and if there had been any , I must have heard it . Jury . Did Mr. Bird sit with you . Bushel . Mr. Bird was pretty much at that End of the Table all the Night . Q . Did the Prisoner make any Answer when you said they would be stifled . Bushel . He did not make any Answer . Bird . My going down then was not to put People in , but to see that they were safe . Bushel . The Constable of the Night and I went away just about five o'Clock ; and just before we went away , he went down three or four Steps ; he did not go into the Hole nor into the Passage , but followed Mr. Bird , with his long Staff in his Hand , and Bird went quite down ; for that was the Time they were put in . Q . When you went down , what Sort of Air was there in the Place ? Bushel . There was a little wooden Door opened on the outside of the Round-House next the Street , and that was opened by the Constable 's Order before we went away . - There is a Common-Sewer always runs under it . Bird . I beg the Favour of you to ask him , whether at the Time of my going down , it was not the Care of the Constable ; whether it was not at the Constable 's Request ; and whether I did not say upon the Stairs , What do you bring them down for ? I have more than I know what to do with already . And whether Mr. Akins [ the Constable ] did not say , I will have my House cleared ? Bushel . I can not say I heard any such Thing . Q . If the Constable had ordered any such thing , must you not have heard it ? Bushel . I think I must . Elizabeth Surridge . I was carried to St. Martin 's Round-House , between twelve and one , and I staid drinking till about three o'Clock in the Watch-House , up Stairs ; then I happened to fall a-sleep by the Fire Side , and Mr. Bird came to me , and said , Come , you Bitch , you shall not sleep here : And then he put me and two other Women into the Hole . - Mr Bird himself put us down . Q . In what Condition did you find the Place , when you came into it ? Surridge . It was very hot ; not fit for so many People to be there . Q . Was there any Stench there ? Surridge . Yes , there was the Stench of a Necessary-House . - The Door was fastened presently after we were put in . Q . Did you make any outcries ? Surridge . We desired not to have so many People in the Place ; before Mary Wood came down , some of the Prisoners joined to get a Dram ; there was a poor Woman brought it in a Bottle , and Bird 's Son said , You will all get drunk before Morning , and shut the Window up , to prevent our having a Dram , but he opened it himself again , in about ten Minutes ; and it was not a quarter of an Hour before it was shut again . Mr. Bird shut it his own self ; he padlocked the Window , and said , Now , you Bitches , you shall not have the Window opened , but die and be damned ; and the Window was not opened afterwards , till about ten in the Morning . - This was about six o'Clock . - Some of us sat in our Shifts , one Woman sat naked ; for it was so hot , I thought I could not live . We cried out Murder and Fire , and told him there were People in Labour , for there were two Women big with Child . I beat with my Shoe against the Wainscote , and all this would not do , no Body came to us . - I did not see Mr. Bird after he shut the Window up . St. Martin 's Clock had struck ten before the Window was opened . I thought every Minute an Hour . Then a Watchman came and opened the Window . I took hold of a Woman 's Arm that was dead ; said I , Here is one Woman dead , and the rest are a-dying , and they took no Notice of that ; but Mr Bird hurried us before the Justice . When I came out of the Place , I drank a Pint of dirty Water myself , and said , For God Almighty 's Sake , to Mrs. Bird , give me a little Water , for I am almost perished , and at last she gave me a Pint of fresh Water . Q . Who was it that was dead ? Surridge . I can not tell , I did not know any of them . Q . How many were there dead ? Surridge . Three I can swear to , if not four , - they lay all along , they did not speak . Q . How do you know they were dead ? Surridge . One of them was Stone-dead , her Face was as black as my Shoe , and the others looked as if they were dead or dying . I said to the People above , that one of the Women was dead , and the rest were a-dying . Q . Who did you beg Water of ? Surridge . We begged it of People on the outside of the Window , going by . I sent to my Landlady , and she came and offered Money for Mary Wood and me to go out of the Hole ; and they said they could not let any Body out , for Mr. Bird was in Bed . We sent for a couple of Pipes , and the People put the small End of the Pipes through the Shutter , and Mary Wood and I sucked Water through the Pipes . Q . Did any Body else suck Water out of the Pipes ? Surridge . No . Bird . Look at me , the Law says the Accuser and the Accused shall look Face to Face . [ She turned her Face towards him . ] Q . How many People were there in the Hole ? Surridge . There were about twenty People . Q . How many People will the Place conveniently hold ? Surridge . I believe about eight or nine . Q . Was there not room enough for a great many People in that Room where you staid till three o'Clock in the Morning ? Surridge . There was room enough for a great many more than were there , and there were People that I could hear walking over Head that were Prisoners ; they might have brought a great many Prisoners out of the Hole , and have put them into other Rooms . Q . Would the Passage between the two Holes hold a great many People ? Surridge . I believe it would hold about seven or eight , and if we had had Liberty of being upon the Stairs , I believe none of us would have been dead . Bird . I would ask her whether I came in a tyrannical Manner ; or only in Subserviency to the Constable ? Did not Mr. Bushel go down with me ? Surridge . No indeed he did not . Jury . Please to ask the Woman whether she heard of any Body 's beating the Candle out of Mr Bird 's Hand ? Surridge . I did not hear any thing of that . [ Mr Churchman called again . ] Q. Mr Churchman , you have measured this Room ; how many Persons will this Room contain , to have reasonable Room without doing them a Prejudice , or their being in danger of their Lives . Churchman . I believe there is room for twenty People if there was Air let into it , for there are Benches all round for them to sit on . Bird . I desire this Question to be asked her ; whether about five o'Clock , when you went down , there was not a singing or hallowing ? Surridge . There was a Noise of People 's talking . Q . Was there any Rejoicing ? Surridge . It was not a Place to rejoice in , there was no singing that I know of . Bird . Ask Mr. Bushel if he did not hear singing there ? Bushel . I did not hear any singing , nor any crying out , and I sat where if there had been a cry of any Thing I must have heard it . Jury . Mr. Bushel , is he reckoned a cruel Man to his Prisoners , or does he treat them with Humanity ? Bushel . He is reckoned to be pretty hasty . Bird . Answer the Question plainly , am I reckoned cruel ? Court . A merciful Man may be hasty , is he cruel or humane ? Bushel . He is pretty cruel , my Lord . Q. Mary Cosier , Were you one of the unhappy Persons who were taken up the 15th or 16th of July ? Cosier . I was taken up the 15th between eleven and twelve at Night . Q . What Place were you carried to ? Cosier . To the Watch-House in St. Martin 's . Q . What Room were you put into ? Cosier . I was put into the Hole directly . Q . Who put you down ? Cosier . The Man of the Watch-House . Q . Look round and see whether you know the Person that put you down ? Cosier . It was that Man , the Man with a Paper in his Hand , [ That was the Prisoner at the Bar . ] Q . How many People do you reckon were there when you were first put in ? Cosier . I can not say exactly - there might be about twenty People ; the Place was almost full . Jury . You say it was almost full ; how near was it being full ? Cosier . I can not say how many more it would hold , for I think the Place was full when I went down , but they crowded in more afterwards till four o'Clock in the Morning - It was so dark I could not well tell how many were there ; but in the whole I believe there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight . Q . Was there any Complaint of Heat in the Place ? Cosier . Yes , and we cried out Fire , Murder , for Christ 's Sake let us have Water ; for the Lord 's Sake a little Water , for we are stifled with Heat ; I would have given four Shillings for a Gallon of Water . Q . Did you say so to any Body that came down Stairs from the Round-House ? Cosier . I can not say that ; we cried out as loud as we could cry out ; when the Window was open a Woman came and brought her Sister-in-Law a Quartern of Gin , and Bird 's Son told his Father ; and Bird came out and pushed her down , and shut up the Window of the Hole himself , and said they should have nothing at all . Q . Did you hear him say so ? Cosier . Yes , I did . - It was between four and five o'Clock in the Morning , and the Window was shut up from that Time till a quarter of an Hour after Ten - it was that Time when I went out . Q . How were you forced to sit ? Cosier . We were very much crowded , I never have been my self * since : My Thighs were so black I could not tell what to do with them ; this Handkerchief was as stiff as Buckram , with Sweat from the Heat of the Place . * The Witness appeared to be in a weak Condition , and soon after she had given her Evidence fainted away . Jury . When there was a Quartern of Gin brought to the Window , I desire to know whether she apprehended , that Bird shut up the Window to prevent the bringing them more Gin , or maliciously to do them a Prejudice ? Cosier . I can not tell that . Q . Were any of the poor Creatures in Fits ? Cosier . In the Time I was there , there were four or five in Fits , from the Heat of the Place ; but Ann Branch , the little crooked Body in the red Cloak , died on this Side of me , about seven o'Clock in the Morning . I held her up as long as I cou 'd , for I was very weak myself . Q . Were there any People lying dead upon the Ground ? Cosier . Yes : But I did not know they were dead ; for I strove to awake them , thinking they were a sleep : I was the last that came out alive but three , and I shook two of them to awake them . Q . How many were found dead when you were let out ? Cosier . Four , Sir . Q . If that Door had been open that leads to the Stairs , would there have been room enough for you ? Cosier . Yes , I believe there would ; I would have given a Shilling for a little Air for half an Hour ; about three or four o'Clock in the Morning , one of the Women in the Hole would have given him a Shilling for a Pint of Wine . - She would have given Mr. Bird a Shilling to speak to him , or drink a Pint of Wine with him : He said , Damn you , you Bitch , for your Sake , all shall suffer ; then I made Answer , and said , it is hard that all must suffer for one . What Answer he made to that I can not tell . Q . How do you know it was him ? Cosier . Because it was at the Time he brought that Woman down , and he had a Candle in his Hand . Bird . Do not look one upon another , look at that Gentleman . Q . Did any Body strike that Candle out of his Hand , or put it out ? Cosier . No Body , Sir . Q . Was the Candle put out ? Cosier . No , Sir . Q . Have you seen that Woman lately , that would have given him a Shilling ? Cosier . I saw her just now , but I do not know her Name . [ An Officer with a Person named by the Prisoner , were sent with this Witness , for her to bring from among the other Evidences the Woman who offer 'd Bird the Shilling , and she returned with Elizabeth Amey . ] Bird . Who were you brought by ? for I do not find your Name here [ A Paper in his Hand . ] Cosier . I was brought by two Watchmen . Bird . Was any Body brought with you ? Cosier . No , I was brought by myself . - I was at the Cook 's Shop . Bird . There were none came in singly , but were brought in two and three at a Time . Q . How were you when you came out of the Hole ? Cosier . I was so thirsty by the Confinement , and Heat of the Place , that I drank four Pints of dirty Water , and then I drank all the Water out of a Tea Kettle which stood in the Corner of the Place ; I do not know whether that was clean Water or not ; a Gentleman brought three Pails of Water , and I drank three Quarts of that , but I brought it up again . Q. Elizabeth Amey , Were you taken up at any Time and carried to the Round-House ? Amey . I was taken up about twelve o'Clock at Night ; I do not know the Day of the Month ; we went up Stairs , and staid there till between two and three in the Morning , we drank three or four Pots of Beer , and some Shrub ; I went down into the Hole on my Occasions : Bird followed me down ; pulled my Cap off , and beat me with a Key : I cried and screamed , and desired to go up and pay my Reckoning , and he said I should not ; the Air , on opening the Door , was as that of an Oven : I complain 'd of Drought ; and he said we might all stay there and be damned , for he would not let us out ; - he said something of Bitches . Bird . Look at me , Mrs. Amey , see if you know me . Amey . I do ; I know you to be the Person who pulled my Cap off , and beat me with a Key ; and said , Die and be damned , that was too good for us . I bid a Shilling for a Quart of Water , and four Shillings for a Gallon of Water , and he would give us none . Q . Who bid the Money ? Amey . I did myself . Q . What Time was this ? Amey . It was about four o'Clock . Q . Who shut the Window up ? Amey . Mr. Bird himself shut up the Window , upon the Account of a Quartern of Gin that was brought there , and the Window was never opened any more . Q . When the Window was shut up , did he make use of any Expression that you might die and be damned ? Amey . He said he would not open the Window , for we should all get drunk with Gin , and we might die and be damned : I myself offered him a Shilling for a Pint of Wine , if he would let me go up Stairs again ; and he said I should have nothing , for I was an insolent saucy Bitch . Q . Were there any great Outcries ? Amey . Yes : there were Cries as of People in Labour . Q . Did he hear them ? Amey . He knows very well it was so . Bird . Ask her what Time the Window was shut up ? Amey . It was about five o'Clock . Bird . She says it was about five o'Clock , when the Window was shut up : Ask her whether there was any Body there besides me that could hear their Complaints . Amey . No Body but his Son , I believe ; his Son said we were a pack of Bitches , and wanted Gin , and be damned . Jury . Was there room above Stairs for many more People ? Amey . There was room for a great many more , and in the Hole I really believe there were four or five and Twenty when I went in , and four were brought after : And Mr. Bushel said to Mr. Bird ; you had better open the Door , and then there will be room for them , and Mr. Bird said , Damn them , let them make room . Bird . Did not you assault me and beat the Candle out of my Hand . Amey . I did not beat the Candle out of his Hand , nor blow it out . Bird . Did any Body else do it ? Amey . No , no Body else . [ John Leathes sworn . ] Q . Were you at the Round-House on the 16th of July . Leathes . I was going by the Round-House between one and two in the Morning , ( I do not know whether it was the 16th or not ) and hearing there were a great many People taken up , I went in : Mr Bird , the Prisoner at the Bar , was there . Q . Was you down with the Women there ? Leathes . Yes , I went out of Curiosity to see what Girls were there ; for I did not know ; but I might know some of them . Q . Are you sure Bird went down ? Leathes . I am positively'sure he was down ; I desired him to let me go down , which he did ; but there was none of the Girls I saw , that I knew ; they were dirty Creatures . Q . Did not you tell Bird you had a mind to satisfy your Curiosity ? Leathes . Yes , and I said I would give him a Pint of Beer ; and he said stay a little and he would ; and he went down with three Prisoners , and I went along with them . Q . Was there any Stench in the Place ? Leathes . Yes , a very great one ; and not being used to such Smells , I thought I should have been suffocated , for I believe if I had staid there five Minutes , I should have dropped down ; I told him the Danger these poor unhappy Creatures were in , and that if he put any more in , or let them stay there till Morning , they would be dead ; and he said , Let them die and be damned . Q . Was the Room crowded , or how many might be in it ? Leathes . The Room was very full , but I did not tell the Number of People , for I did not care to stay there long . Q . Did you hear any Complaints or Cries ? Leathes . I heard a Moaning while I was down , as if some Body was dying : This was between two and three o'Clock . I did not go down at first when I came in ; for I waited Mr. Bird 's Leisure . Q . During the Time you were there , did you hear any Cries of Mur der or Fire , or want of Water ? Leathes . No , I did not ; nor nothing particular , only he was abusing the Prisoners ; cursing one and damning another , and laying out the Law in an arbitrary Manner . Q . When you were below and heard that low Tone of a Voice , did you ask the Reason of it ? Leathes . No , I did not : I thought some Body might be sick or melancholy . Q . Did you hear them ask for Water ? Leathes . I heard some of them ask for Water , and one ask 'd for Gin . [ Robert Burns , a Soldier , sworn . ] Q . Were you at the Round-House that Night there was such a Number of People put in there ? Burns . Yes : I was put into the Round-House about one o'Clock in the Morning . I drank and smoak 'd with Mr. Bird for about three Hours ; and after I had spent my Money , I was put down into the Hole , into the Mens Hole . Q . How many were there ? Burns . About eight or nine Men . It is just adjoining to the Place where the Women were . Q . How long did you stay in the Hole ? Burns . I staid from four o'Clock in the Morning till about a quarter after Ten . Q . How much Money did you spend there ? Burns . I think it was two or three Shillings , I am not certain . Q . Was that all the Money you had ? Burns . No , I had a Matter of three Guineas and an half in my Pocket . Q . In whose Company were you ? Burns . There was Mr. Bird , and I think the Constable of the Night . Q . Was there any Complaints or Cries ? Burns . While I was there , the Women were quarrelling , and making a great deal of Noise ; and they were laughing above Stairs ; I heard two or three of them were dead . Q . Who shut the Windows ? Burns . I do not know who shut them . I offered half a Crown several Times to have the Light kept open , which was shut before five . The Women called out Murder , enough to frighten any Christian to hear them . You might have heard them from that Place , almost to Charing-Cross . They called out for Air and Water ; and I believe if they had staid there ten Minutes longer , that every Soul of them would have been dead , for they were half of them almost dead when they came out . The Smell was enough to knock one down . I was almost suffocated myself . One of them came up as naked as she was born , - two of them were dead before six o'Clock . While I was above Stairs with Mr. Bird , and smoaking my Pipe , I heard them cry out . Q . Did you know what they said ? Burns . I did not take any Notice of it then . Bird . I think you are a Man of Honour and a Christian ; What Time did you go down into the Hole , and who put you there ? Burns . It was about four o'Clock in the Morning , and it was by your Order . Bird . I had nothing to do with it ; was not you drove down Stairs headlong , and your Hat knocked off ? Burns . Yes , I was thrown down Stairs , but it was by your Order . Bird . I did not say any thing of the Serjeant 's being sent down . I said if I can get those drunken Fellows down Stairs , you shall all come up again . Burns . He did not say any such Thing . You told me , you House-keepers maintained us , and such Stuff as that . Bird . That was when we were talking about military Affairs . Court . Do you think he was in Liquor ? Burns . Yes , I am sure he was , for he drank a great deal along with me . Bird . I did not put him down . Edward Kelk . I live in the King 's Mews , next Door to the Round-House . Q . Do you know any thing of any Cries there , the sixteenth of July in the Morning ? Kelk . I can not say as to the Day of the Month , because I did not set it down ; nor whether it was Morning or not , because I went to Bed at nine o'Clock . I know nothing against the Man . I can not say I heard much crying out that Night , I have heard more Noise some other Nights . I heard a Noise ; they were making Orations , but whether they were rejoicing , or what it was , I could not distinguish . Q . Did you hear any Thing of Murder or Fire cried out ? Kelk . I did not hear any Thing of Murder or Fire cried out . Q. George Colclough , What Business are you of ? Colclough . I am a Barber , Perriwig-Maker , and Surgeon . Q . Were you sent for to bleed any Body at St. Martin 's Round-House ? Colclough . Yes ; on the 16th of July , at half an Hour after ten , or about eleven in the Morning , I was sent for ; the Person that came , said , For God 's Sake , Mr. Colclough , come and bleed one who is very ill ; I went to the Round-House ; when I went down the Stairs , I saw a young Woman lying upon the Ground . I blooded them first who were in the most Danger . One Mr. Perkins was there , said he , Mr. Colclough , shall I come to your Assistance ? I said , there is need enough of it , so he assisted me . There was one of the Women , I believe , had been dead two Hours . When I came to this Woman that I saw first , she was got up to the Ground-Floor . I blooded her , sent for a Chair , and put her into it , and gave her Wine and Water . Then I went and blooded another Woman at the Plough-Door , in the Street , and took others to the Workhouse ; and one of those in the Work-house was two Days before she spake to me ; one was quite dead when I went in , another was near expiring , and two more died . Q . What do you think to be the Occasion of their Death ? Colclough . They were suffocated with Heat , and smothered . Q . Did you know Mary Maurice ? Colclough . I knew none of them by their Names . - The Heat was enough to kill me , I could hardly hear it . I was wet quite through my Coat , Waistcoat , Shirt , and all , so that I thought I should have died ; and I was not there above a Quarter of an Hour : but I thought it my Duty to do what Service I could to my Fellow-Creatures . Court . How many do you think this Room would contain conveniently ? Colclough . I should think eight enough . Q . But suppose twenty Persons were to be confined in this Room for an Hour , what would be the Consequence of that ? Colclough . I think , if I was to be confined there an Hour , I must inevitably die . Q . Do you think if twenty Persons were to be confined in this Place for an Hour together , it would manifestly endanger their Lives ? Colclough . I should think I might live when I came to a little Air . Court . I wish you would attend to a Question when you are upon your Oath : Do you think if twenty People were confined there for an Hour , they would not be in manifest Danger of their Lives ? Colclough . I think they must be in manifest Danger . Court . Now you answer the Question . Bird . I desire to know who sent for him , for it was I that sent . Colclough . It was Broadbent the Beadle that came for me ; I can not tell who sent him . I saw Mr. Bird very busy a writing , and his Wife vastly concerned . Bird . Did you see any Thing in my Behaviour that was bad ? Colclough . No : Nothing in particular . Bird . Did not I send for the Chair . Colclough . When I asked for the Chair , Bird said he would send for it , but the Chair never came . Q . What Chair is that ? Colclough . The Work-house Chair ; and it did not come till I sent for it a second Time . Bird . I can prove it came immediately , as soon as the proper Person was sent for it . [ John Perkins , Surgeon , sworn . ] Q . Did you see any Woman that died in the Round-House , the 16th Day of July in the Morning . Perkins . On the 16th of July , about 11 o'Clock in the Morning , I was sent for to these unfortunate People . When I came to the Round-House , I saw a Woman in Convulsions . I blooded her . She bled very slow , and was dying ; and I think she died in about half an Hour or an Hour . I was told , there were more of these unfortunate People that wanted my Assistance . There were three more in Convulsions in the Hole : One Woman my Servant bled , another Mr. Colclough bled . I gave proper Orders for these People what to take . I was afraid they would have died , but Nature helped , and with a little Assistance they recovered . There were four of them dead in the Bone-House of St. Martin 's Church-yard . Q . As you are a Surgeon , you can give us your Opinion : What do you think to be the Occasion of their Deaths ? Perkins . I believe they were suffocated for want of a due Quantity of Air : Their Faces were bloated , and the Blood was stagnated ; I looked as far as their Breasts , and they were black , and they were so down to their Fingers Ends . Q . What Colour were their Faces of ? Perkins . Not quite black , but of a livid Colour . Q . Is that the common Appearance that Persons have who are suffocated for want of a due Quantity of Air ? Perkins . Generally , I believe ; but there are some Persons who die a natural Death , that are a little livid . - I was not down in the Hole , but I was willing to do the best I could for the Service of those poor Creatures who were alive , that they said were dying . Council . In order to ascertain that Mary Maurice was one of the Persons who died in the Hole , I would ask Bland what Clothes she had on . Q . What Clothes had Mary Maurice on ? Sarah Bland . She had a black Petticoat , and a white Gown like a Bed-gown , it was a long Gown . [ Elizabeth Surridge called again . ] Q . Did you take any Notice of any body that lay dead in the Hole ? Surridge . When I went down for my Handkerchief , I saw them all lying there ; and the Woman that I saw in the Bone-house , was the same that I saw in the Hole ; she had a whitish Gown , and a black Petticoat . John Maurice . I saw my Wife , Mary Maurice , in the Bone-house , the Day the People were carried before the Justice : She had a white-colour 'd Gown , a black Petticoat , and red Shoes . Council . I must trouble a Gentleman I see upon the Bench with one Question . Colonel De Veil , do you know the Prisoner at the Bar . Colonel De Veil . I know him very well , Sir . Bird . Can a Man be a Witness that offered to lay five Guineas to one that I should be hanged ? Colonel De Veil . I never said such a Thing in my whole Life . I believe the Gentlemen that appear here upon this Occasion will declare , that I never spoke to one of them , but only sent them the Depositions . Bird . I have it so here . Colonel De Veil . At the hazard of my Life I went into the Mob , brought him off and saved his Life . Bird . That was after you had published it in the News , and made me appear to be as cruel a Dog as ever lived . Colonel De Veil . Can you prove I put any thing into the News ? Court . Do not interrupt the Evidence , this only tends to confound us . Council . I would ask Colonel De Veil whether he has ever given this Man any Directions with respect to the Prisoners that are committed to his Charge before this happened ? Colonel De Veil . I sent for him twice to let him know the Complaints that were made against him for putting People into that Hole , who were not Felons ; for I always apprehended that Place was only fit for People who were refractory , and for Felons , I only thought it fit for such People : - He never sent me Word of any Bodies being dead in his Round-House : I had examined thirteen People before I knew any thing of the Matter , and when I knew how they were I discharged them immediately ; and I did not know but some of the People who were in my Yard might have died there ; I believe it was about twelve o'Clock . Bird . Do not go to save your Reputation at the Expence of my Life , but be upon Honour . Colonel De Veil . I had sent out a Warrant ; the Warrant was to be returned at eight o'Clock in the Morning . I examined thirteen Prisoners before I knew of any Thing that had happened in the Round-House . Q . How long may it be from the Time of your giving him those Directions and this thing happening ? Colonel De Veil . It might be half a Year between the Time of my giving him that Caution and this thing happening ? Bird . My Lord , I am very unhappy in having my Papers destroyed : I was in hopes I should have found them : I do acknowledge I had two Summons 's from him , one of them was to know why I discharged two Persons , without Orders from him , for cursing the King ; and the other to know why I did not quarter two Soldiers , when I never had any Licence . Court . You hear what he says , is it so ? Colonel De Veil . Upon my Oath I sent for him twice to check him for that very Thing I have mentioned : I do not know whether it was by written Summons 's , or whether I sent for him by a Message . Bird . If he had sent for me I should out of Complaisance have gone , for I never was afraid of any Thing . Court . They have gone through the Evidence for the Prosecution , and now it is your turn to offer what you have to say in your Defence ; do not hurry yourself , and I hope every one that is within hearing will consider a Man , that stands upon Trial for his Life , and I should be injurious to the Person who is the Prisoner at the Bar , if I should not turn every Body out of Court who will not be silent . Bird . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury ; I am the Person who is so unhappy as to be indicted here for Murder ; I had but seven Witnesses , one of which is in the Hospital , in a Salivation ; and Bushel , who is the principal , has sworn himself out of it . [ Elizabeth Beaumont sworn . ] Q . Where you carried to the Round-House that Night the Women were confined there , and some of them died ? Beaumont . Yes , I was carried there about half an Hour after eleven o'Clock at Night . Q . Where were you put when you first came in ? Beaumont . Into the Drinking-Room ? Q . How long did you stay in the Drinking-room ? Beaumont . Till five o'Clock in the Morning . Q . What came of you afterwards ? Beaumont . Those that were in the Drinking-Room were all put down . Q . Who were in the Drinking-Room ? Beaumont . I can not justly tell , but the Constable and the Beadle insisted upon putting them all down before they left the House , and they were all put into the Hole , but I was not : Mr. Bird went down to put them in , and I followed him down in order to go in ; and he pushed me up again , saying , What Business have you here , I have more than I know what to do with or can shut in ; and he came up and left the Door of the Hole open : He said he would not have them stifled under him ; for he would not shut the Door ; there were five or six came up with me . Q . How came the rest not to come up ? Beaumont . I can not tell ; Mr. Bird said he could not shut them in ; and he said , leave the Door open , and let them be upon the Stairs all Night to give them Room : The Constable of the Night , and the Beadle , insisted on having the House cleared before they went to Bed ; or else they said there would be nothing all Night but drinking Gin and smoaking Tobacco : The Constable of the Night , and the Beadle , came up again and said to Mr. Bird , Damn you , I have shut them in , why could not you ? Mr. Bird insisted on having the top Door shut , and the under one left open , and said , they could not break through an Iron Door and Stone Walls . I paid for a Bed and went up , and Mr. Bird and his Wife came up and laid down till about nine o'Clock , when they opened the Door . Q . From the Time of your coming in , did you hear any cry of Fire , or Murder , or Water , or any cry whatsoever ? Beaumont . I did not hear any - about three o'Clock in the Morning , the People above asked for some Water , and had some brought them ; I heard none below call for Water . Q . Where was you ? Beaumont . I was in the upper Room . Bird . There were none put down till they were forced by the Constable and Beadle , for I would have had them all have staid above ; pray ask her , as to the Liquor that was sold that Night , whether there was any till it was at their own request ; and that was sent for from a Night-House . Beaumont . Several Gallons of Beer were sent for , but I do not know from whence it came , but there was no other Liquor . Bird . Where did I sit ? Beaumont . He sat next to the Constable of the Night . Bird . Did I oblige any People to send for Liquor ? Beaumont . No , Mr. Bird said he did not desire them to send for any . Jury . Did you pay any Money to Mr. Bird for staying above , and having the Use of the upper Room ? Beaumont . No , I had no Money . Jury . Did you promise any ? Beaumont . No , I did not . Q . Did you go into Bed ? Beaumont . No , I did not go into Bed . [ On the cross Examination . ] Q . How came it that you had this Liberty more than any Body else ? Beaumont . There were several Gentlemen above Stairs , who were Officers of the Parish , that desired I might not go down into the Hole . Q . Were there any that desired to be kept above Stairs ? Beaumont . No , I did not hear any . [ Mrs. Amey was going to speak ; says Bird , Pray , Mrs. Amey hold your Tongue , I shall show your Character by and by . ] Q . Was Busbel there . Beaumont . Busbel was there , but he was very drunk . Q . Are you sure the Constable of the Night and the Beadle went down with the Prisoners ? Beaumont . Yes , I am . Q . What Time was that ? Beaumont . It was about 5 o'Clock , and they went away immediately . Q . Who made use of that Expression , Why could not you do it as well as I ? Beaumont . It was the Constable of the Night , or the Beadle , and not Mr. Bird . Q. Mr. Bushel , do you remember this Woman 's being there ? Bushel . She was not there when the Constable of the Night went away ; she was gone to Bed : She was not down at five o'Clock . Jury . Mr. Bushel , were you not in Liquor ? - Bushel . I was as sober as I am now . Q . How near was the Room she went to Bed in , to that you were in ? Bushel . It was up one pair of Stairs . - I went down a little before they were put down into the Hole ; and I told him , I could not put them in . The Constable went down three or four Steps , and Bird went before him ; I saw the Constable upon the Stairs all the Time , he went no farther I am sure of it . Q. I want to know for what Purpose he went down ; whether it was to have the House cleared , or what it was for ? Bushel . I believe he went to have them put in . Bird . Did not Amey knock the Candle out of my Hand ? Beaumont . I did not see any Thing of that : I did hear of the Candle 's being put out , but I can not tell who did it ; but the Candle did go out . Bird . There was no Occasion for another Candle to be brought , if the Candle I had was not out : The Candle was out , and another brought down : You saw that ? Beaumont . I saw the Candle was out , and there was another brought down . Mr. Bird was almost dead among them wi th the Heat and stirring about . Bird . 'T is very odd the High-Constable should not come to have let me known what I must do with People . Council . You say you went up Stairs again with five or six People : Where was Bird then ? Beaumont . Bird followed me close up Stairs . Q . How came the Constable and Beadle to be so favourable to you , as to let you go up , when they put the others down ? Beaumont . The others did not desire any such Thing . - Those five or six that came up desired to be in the Drinking-Room all Night . Q . You said before , you desired a Bed , and said you would pay for it , and that was the Reason you were not turned down . Beaumont . I do not remember that I said any such Thing . Q . If you did not offer to pay for a Bed any more than the rest , how came that Distinction to be made ? Beaumont . There were some Gentlemen drinking there that desired it . Mary Hammond was brought in with me , but was not put into the Hole . Q . When he first went down , did he open the Hole-Door ? Beaumont . Yes . Q . How long was it before the Candle was brought again ? Beaumont . Three or four Minutes . Q . Was the Door open when the Candle came back ? Beaumont . He stood with the Door in his Hand , and shut the Door when the Candle came down . Q . Did any of these poor Wretches come out when he opened the Door ? Beaumont . I can not say that any of them did . Council . You said before , he left the Door of the Hole unlock 'd . Beaumont . He said he would shut the Stairs-door , and leave the other Door open ; but I can not tell whether he did or not . There was such a Mob about the Window , that Bird 's Son came down and told his Father , that they would not have Air ; and Mr. Bushel was sent to beat them away . Council . Why you say , he [ Bushel ] was drunk . Beaumont . Yes , so he was . Court . When the Candle was brought down , could you see how many People there were in the Hole ? Beaumont . No , I could not . Henry Harris . I am a Watchman in the Strand . On the 15th of July I carried a Woman to the Round-House-Door , for making a Riot in the Street , and Mr. Bird refused to take her in , beause he had too many already ; this was between three and four o'Clock . Q . How long have you known him in this Office ? Harris . I have been a Watchman 12 Months , and have known him all that Time . Q . Have you heard any Persons give him an ill Character , as a cruel Man ? Harris . No , none but the Women of the Street , and they will speak any thing . Michael Hayes . I am a Watchman , I went along with Harris , and when we came to the Watch-house Door , Mr. Bird refused to take any more in , for that he had more than he knew what to do with . Council . So he took who he would , and refused who he would . Bird . No , Mr. Stracy , No , no . Thomas Warrington . The sixteenth of July between three and four in the Morning , I brought a Man down to the Round-House , for breaking of Windows , and the Constable and Mr. Busbel discharged him . Q . How did the Constable and Mr. Busbel behave on this Occasion . Warrington . They behaved very well for what I could see . Q . Did you apprehend Bushel to be drunk or sober ? Warrington . I am not a Judge whether he was or was not . Bird . Answer the Question , do you think he was in Liquor or not ? Warrington . I can not say whether he was or not . I staid there about half an Hour . Bird . What Part did I act at that Time ? Warrington . He sat behind the Table : I do not remember what he said . Bird . Did I oppose the Man 's being discharged , or any ways intermeddle ? Warrington . I can not say any Thing to that , but he did not get off his Seat . [ John Tilton sworn . ] Bird . Please to examine him , my Lord , what Time of the Night he came , and what Time he went away . Q . What are you ? Tilton . I am principal Watchman of the Parish of St. Martin 's . Q . What Time did you come to the Round-House , on the 15th or 16th of July ? Tilton . Between ten and eleven o'Clock , the 15th of July , at Night , and staid till five o'Clock in the Morning . Q . In what Manner did Bird behave during that Time ? Tilton . I did not see any thing amiss in his Behaviour , the Prisoners were brought in pretty fast , and he ordered them down into the Hole . Bird . Ask him whether I went from behind the Table , for I sat at the Table with the Constable to take the Names of the Prisoners down . Tilton . He was on the other Side of the Table setting the Prisoners Names down ; there being so many Prisoners they were ordered down into the Hole , for we could not keep them in the Room . - He did come from behind the Table two or there Times to order the Prisoners into the Hole . Q . Did he go into the Hole ? Tilton . I do not know whether he went into the Hole , till between four or five in the Morning . Court . Who went down to put the Prisoners in , and said , he could not put them in ; was it the Prisoner or Bushel ? Tilton . It was Busbel ; he was ordered by Bird . Q . What was the Expression Bushel made use of when he came up from the Hole ? Tilton . He said there were so many there already , that he could not put any more in ; and the Prisoner afterwards said to Bushel , you could not put them in , but I have put them in , in a Minute . Q . Did you look upon Bushel to be sober ? Tilton . I believe we were all sober , I saw none of us drunk . Court . How has he behaved in general to the Prisoners , has he behaved handsomely , or with Cruelty ? Tilton . He always behaved well to them , I have seen him dress them when they came in wounded , and with their Heads broke : And he always endeavoured to make Peace among them , when they have quarrelled . Q . Did he always use them gently ; or was he some Times rigorous ? Tilton . Sometimes one Way , and sometimes another . Council . What Reason did Busbel give , when he said there was so many in the Hole , that he could not put any more in ? Tilton . He said they would be stifled , if there were more put in , and he would put no more in ; and Bird went down and put them in . Bird . Do you think I would have put these three Persons down , if I thought there had not been room for them ? Whether I would have put them in , if I had thought to have murdered or destroyed three or four People . Tilton . I believe he would not have put them in designedly to destroy them . Q . Was any thing said by Busbel of giving them more Room ? Tilton . Yes , he said if the Door of the Hole was opened for them to come to the Stairs , there would be more Air ; and Bird said , if they were let out , they would let the Men out : The Door at the Head is a single Leaf . Q . Has he the Character of a Person that uses the People kindly or harshly ? Tilton . He does use them a little cruelly sometimes . Bird . In what Respect do you mean I use them cruelly ? Whether with a Broomstick , or what ? Tilton . Why with his Tongue , my Lord . Bird . Do not you reckon that it is the Duty of the Beadle , and the Constable of the Night , to put these People there ? Tilton . You had no Occasion to do that , for you took that Business out of our Hands . Bird . I have not any Business with any of the Prisoners , only with the Constable , to attend him and the Watchmen . Q. Tilton , When he put these People down , was it by the Direction of the Constable , or did he do it of his own Head ? Tilton . He did it of his own Head : The Constable ca n't read or write , he knew nothing of the Search . [ Paul Broadbent sworn . ] Bird . Did I not do what I could for the Relief of the Prisoners when the Door was opened ? Broadbent . He said there were People very ill , and he desired me to go down : This was after I had been with some Prisoners to Colonel De Veil 's . When I saw what a Condition they were in , I spoke to a Person to bleed them . Bird . Did not I send you for Coclough and Frasbury 's young Man ; and sent you for Spirits , thinking they were fainting ; not imagining this would be their Deaths . Broadbent . He got Drops to revive them , as soon as well could be , and sent me to Coclough and Perkins . Q . How many died in the Hole . Broadbent . There were four died in the Hole ; one was quite dead when I went down , and three more died in half an Hour , or three quarters of an Hour ; there were six in the Hole then : All the four that died were blooded , as well as those two that lived . Q . What Condition was the Room in ; was it not difficult to breathe in ? Broadbent . It was nauseous with the Sweat of the People . Edmund Thomas . I am one of the Overseers of the Poor . July 16 , about eleven o'Clock he told me , he had had a confused Night of it ; for the High-Constable had been out with a Search-Warrant , and he had a great Number of Prisoners ; and he said some of them were so very ill , that he was afraid they were near expiring , and desired an Order for the Chair of the Work-house : He did not say any of them were expired . Bird . How did I behave while you was Constable ? E. Thomas . I served the Office in 1740 and 1741 , and during my Year he behaved with Humanity . Q. I ask you , Sir , whether that is his general Character , his dealing humanely with his Prisoners ? E. Thomas . He is a hasty hot Man . [ Samuel Attershall , Governor of Bridewell , sworn . ] Attershall . I have seen him five or six Times ; he has brought Prisoners to our House . I know nothing of his Character in this Point . Bird . He is but young in the Place . John Horseman , the Turnkey and Hemp-Dresser . He has brought Prisoners to our House , and ordered Beds for them . Jonas Gray . I was Constable about three Years ago . I never knew any harm of him ; he was apt to quarrel with his Wife sometimes , and then I would bid him go up Stairs , for I reckoned that House mine . - He behaved well to the Prisoners all my Year , - He treated them with Humanity , and oftentimes gave them Victuals and Drink . Q . Had you ever 20 Prisoners in that Place at one Time ? Gray . I have had nineteen there at one Time , and kept them there four or five Hours . - The Dean and Chapter of Westminster had ordered all the Beggars to be taken up , and they were put in there . - It was in the hard Frost , and they had strong Beer , Bread and Cheese , and Air . - I would not have kept them there without Refreshment , but I think the Constable ought to send them to the Gate-house , or some other Prison . Q . Did you see any Person in a white Gown ? Gray . I do not know . I think all their Cloaths were hardly worth 5 s. and I think really they were stifled with drinking of Liquors . Lewis Quondrean . I have been Constable almost twelve Months . Now and then , when the Prisoner was a little in Liquor , he would make a Noise : but to force his Liquor upon People he never did in my Time , nor trouble himself whether they spent any Money or no . Bird . Sir John , as you are my Council , I desire to know whether it is necessary to send for the Constable of the Night ? Sir John Strange . I shall take Care of all legal Advantages for you . You may send for him if you will . Joseph Akins . I was Constable of the Night , when this Accident happened . I went there about eleven o'Clock , and continued there till between four and five in the Morning . I was in the Chair above Stairs all the Time . Q . Did you write down the Names of the Prisoners ? Akins . I can not write . Q . Did you employ any Body to do it for you ? Akins . I employed none , nor asked none . Bird wrote some of them , I do not know whether he wrote them all or no ; he was writing before I came in . Q . How long was it before you went away , that Bird went down into the Hole ? Akins . I do not know any thing of his going quite down into the Hole . Q . Is it usual to have the House cleared before you go away ? Akins . It is just as he likes his Customers . Q . You went down into the Hole , What did you go down for ? Akins . When I was going away , I went down two or three Steps into the Hole , with my Staff in my Hand . Q . For what Purpose did you go down that Step or two ? Jury . My Lord , he seems to be afraid of charging himself . Q . What Business had you to stand with your Staff there , when the Prisoner went into the Hole . [ The Witness made no Answer . ] Q . Did you stand at the Top of the Stairs before you left the Round-House , to see the Prisoners confined in the Hole ? Akins . The Prisoners were nothing at all to me ; I put none down into the Hole . Q . Do you know of the Beadle 's going down with any ? Akins . No : Neither of his going down , or coming up . - Court . Speak the Truth , there is no body will ask you any Questions to charge yourself . Q . Did you see the Beadle go down with any People ? Akins . No , I did not see him go down . Mr. Bushel the Beadle said , There was not Room enough . I can not say whether Bird went down to the Bottom or no . - He said he had done what Bushel could not do . Jury . As you was there all Night , did you see any ill Usage from Bird to the Prisoners ? Akins . I did not see any Thing of any Misbehaviour . - He behaved very well . - I never saw him soberer in my Life . - I believe Bushel was sober . Q . Sir , answer the Question that was put to you , What you stood on the Stairs , going down into the Hole , with your Staff in your Hand for ? Akins . Why , it was to see whether what Bushel said could not be done , could be done . Jury . Did you hear the Cries of the Women in the Hole ? Akins . No , I did not hear any ; there was Singing either among the Men or Women , but which I can not tell : We had more Noise above to drown that below . - I did not see any Gin , or any strong Liquors carried down . John Howard . I have known the Prisoner almost ever since he was born : I have employed him in writing , and always took him to be a good natured Man , but he is hasty and passionate ; - but not cruel or ill-natured . Ann Mables . I have known him nine Years . When I heard of this Accident , I never was so shocked in my Life ; for I always knew him to be a good-natur 'd Man , and never knew him to be guilty of a cruel Action . Ann Catherine Bret , Widow of the late Governor of Bridewell . I have known him three Quarters of a Year , and he always behaved handsomely to the Prisoners , when he has brought any to our House - and sometimes gave them Money . German Merchant . I have known him ten Years ; and he has been often benevolent to the Prisoners , and used them well . John Ellis . I have known him near twenty Years , and his Father before him ; I never heard any Thing amiss of him . Mark Coney . I have known the Prisoner four Years . I never saw any Thing but that his Temper was very well . I served Constable last Year , he behaved very well , unless he was a little in Liquor , and then I used to bid him go out of the House . - He behaved very well to the Prisoners . Mark Hodgson . I have known him three Years . I served the Office of Constable last Year , and his Behaviour was always very civil to the Prisoners , and he has given distressed Prisoners Money to relieve them . The Evidence being gone through , it was observed by the Court , on Behalf of the Prisoner , that the first Part of the Charge , viz . his forcing , putting , and placing her in this Hole , was so far from being prov 'd , that the contrary appear 'd on Evidence ; and they doubted , whether it being so laid , it was not become necessary to be proved . It was said on the Part of the Crown , that if in the first Instance she was not forced , yet from the Time she cried out for Relief , and desired they might be thinned or let out , the continuing her there was a forcible Consinement ; and the continuing her there , knowing the Danger she was in , may make that a Force upon her , ab initio : but that as this particular Fact need not have been laid , there is no Necessity to prove it . For this purpose was cited 2 Hawkins , Chap . 46 . Sect . 41 . Also Mackalley 's Case , in killing a Serjeant in London , on a Special Verdict found at the Old Bailey , December 5 , 1610 , which was said to be a Case in Point . [ The first Exception to which Verdict was , that there was a material Variance betwixt the Indictment and the Verdict , for the Indictment supposed that the Sheriff had made a Precept to the Serjeant at Mace to arrest the Defendant , and by the Verdict it appeared that there was not any such Precept made , so that the Indictment being Special , to make that Offence Murder by Construction of Law upon the Special Matter without any Malice prepense , ought to be pursued , and proved in Evidence , which was not done in that Case , for the Jury did not find the said Special Matter , but the contrary ; and because the Jurors had not found the Special Matter contained in the Indictment , but other Matter , Judgment could not be given against the Prisoner upon that Indictment . To which it was answered , and in the End resolv 'd by all the Judges of England , that there was sufficient Matter contained in the Indictment , upon which the Court ought to give Judgment of Death against the Prisoner , notwithstanding the said Variance . And he was executed , 9 Rep. 62 - 70 . ] Upon the Whole , the Jury found the Verdict Special to the following Effect , viz . We find that William Bird , the Person indicted , on the 15th and 16th of July last , was Keeper of St Martin 's Round-House in Middlesex . And that Mary , the Wife of John Maurice , in the Indictment named , was duly committed on the same 16th of July , to the said Keeper , to be there kept in safe Custody . And we further find , that while the said Mary Maurice was in Custody of the said Keeper as aforesaid , one Sarah Bland , who was then also in the Custody of the said William Bird , as Keeper aforesaid , was on the same 16th Day of July , about the Hour of two in the Morning of the same Day , forced , put , and placed , by the said William Bird , in a certain close Room , called the Hole , then being Part of the Building , called St Martin 's Round-House . And we further find , that the said Mary Maurice then desired the said William Bird , that she might go down into the said Hole along with the said Sarah Bland ; and that she did accordingly go with the said Sarah Bland into the said Hole . And we further find , that the said Mary Maurice , soon after she was in the said Hole , as aforesaid , did request the said William Bird to be released out of the said Hole . But we further find , that on the same 16th Day of July , the said . William Bird , notwithstanding such Request of the said Mary Maurice , to be released out of the said close Room , called the Hole , as aforesaid , did continue and confine the said Mary Maurice , being so in the Hole as aforesaid , for the Space of two Hours , against the Will and Consent of her the said Mary Maurice , during all which Time there were twenty other Persons confined as Prisoners by the said William Bird , in the same close Room , as in the said Indictment is alledged . And we further find , that the said close Room , during the Time aforesaid , was not of sufficient Largeness to confine twenty Persons therein , for the Space of one Hour , without manifest Danger of their Lives , as in the said indictment is also alledged . And we further find , that by Reason of the said continuing and confining her the said Mary , by the said William Bird , in Form aforesaid , in the said close Room , she , the said Mary , during the said Time of her Confinement as aforesaid , viz . on the said 16th Day of July in the close Room aforesaid , was suffocated , and that she there died , during the Time of her said Confinement , of such Suffocation , as in the said Indictment is also alledged . But we find that the said William Bird did not force , put , or place the said Mary Maurice , into the said close Room , called the Hole , as in the said Indictment is also alledged : We find all other Matters and Circumstances necessary for bringing the Point in Issue before the Court ; But whether the said William Bird is guilty of the Felony and Murder in the said Indictment supposed , we know not . But if upon the Whole , & c. * * William Bird was likewise arraigned on an Indictment , for the Murder of Phillis Wells , Spinster . And also on another Indictment , for the Murder of Ann Branch , Spinster ; both which Trials were put off to the next Sessions . 103. Jane Wood was indicted for stealing 13 Guineas , and 7 Shillings in Money , in the Dwelling-house of Samuel Windsor , and his Property , September the 4th . Samuel Windsor . I lost a Sum of Money out of my Drawer last Saturday in the Afternoon ; about 10 Guineas , how much more I can not say : The Money was in a Drawer , in the one Pair of Stairs Room backward . I did not miss it till five o'Clock on Monday Morning . I live at the George in Broad St Giles 's : The Prisoner used to come to my House to play with a Child of mine ; there was no Body up Stairs that Day but that Girl ; and she owned to the Constable , in my Presence , that she took eight Guineas and some Silver out of my Drawer , on Saturday in the Afternoon , and that she took five Guineas from me two or three Months before ; which Money I missed , but did not know she took it Q . Did you give her any Hopes or Promise of Favour if she would confess ? Samuel Windsor . I told her if she would tell me of any Body that were her Accomplices , I would be as favourable as ever I could ; she said she had no Accomplice , but that she gave her Mother one half Guinea of it to pay her Rent ; and had seven Guineas of it in her Box : Colonel De Veil ordered the Constable to go with me and the Girl , which I did ; she unlock 'd the Box , and took out six Guineas , and gave them into my Hand ; I deliver 'd them to Colonel De Veil , she owned these were my Guineas ; she gave me a Pair of Buckles , and a Pair of Ear-rings , and said she had bought them with the five Guineas she took from me before , and delivered up some Clothes . John Harris , the Constable that served the Warrant . She told me she took eight Guineas and some Silver out of the Drawers , that she found the Keys on the Drawers ; and laid them there again . Windsor . I did not know any Harm of the Girl before now . John Hastings . I have known the Prisoner from an Infant , and never knew any Harm of her ; she is very ignorant , but was always reputed an honest , Girl : She was frightened into Fits some Years ago , by some Soldiers coming into the House , which took away her Senses ; I got her into the Infirmary at Westminster , and she was sometime there before she was cured : I am a Gold-smith at Charing-Cross , her Father worked for me , and she used to bring things backward and forward , and I never found her dishonest .

Henry Messenger deposed : That he was on Board the Ship called the Blessing , August the second , at Ratcliff Cross , in the Port of London , about eleven at Night , he saw a Boat come along Side the Vessel , which gave him a Suspicion that something was to be done , and laid his Hand upon Half an Ancher of Brandy ; and then another ; that he seized them , and no Man obstructed him . A Man came and struck him on the Shoulder , or pushed him violently , and struck him Head-foremost down the Ladder into the Stearage , followed him and beat him , and struck him several Blows ; and he took half an Anchor and run away with it ; that John Morell the Prisoner beat him , and said he was Captain of the Ship ; that he [ Morell ] was Boatswain of the Ship , Blessing ; that the Sailors must know him to be an Officer , because they call them Partners , but he did not know whether Morell was present when the Custom-house-Officers came on Board ; that he is sure this is the Man that abused and assaulted him , and that he must know him to be an Officer , because he had suffered him to carry some little Things on Shore . William Walls deposed : That he was a Tidesman on Board the Ship , Blessing : That he saw his Partner , Messenger , fall Neck and Heels down the Steerage , and saw a Man follow him , and saw him strike Messenger two or three Blows . That his Partner , Messenger , call 'd out , What will you stay and see me murdered ; and that then he turned out as fast as he could . That when he came into the Forecastle , he laid his Hands upon a Man 's Legs or Thighs , and asked him , What Business he had there ? He said , Damn your Blood , I am Captain of the Ship , What Business have you with me ? That he ( Watts ) said to him , be you the Devil , I will hold you if I can ; that he said to his Partner , Messenger , here 's one of them . That then his Partner came to his Assistance ; that before he came , he struck him three or four Blows on the Belly . That John Morell , the Prisoner at the Bar , is the Man . That they had no Occasion to declare they were Officers , for all the Ship 's Company knew it . That Morell was Boatswain of the Ship , and came up from Gravesend with them . That they never show them their Deputations - That there was another Man came into the Forecastle with a Handspike , and struck at Messenger , and then they cried out Murder , and had Assistance from other Ships ; three from one Ship , and one from another . Jonathan Bonner deposed : That hearing a Cry of Murder on Board the Ship , Blessing , they went on board her off the Forecastle into the Windlace , and from thence to the Main Deck ; and before the Windlace they found Messenger had hold of the Prisoner at the Bar , and that Messenger kept his hold , till he , Bonner , laid hold of him , with the Assistance of the Rest of the Officers , and they carried him into the Cabbin , and continued with him all Night , and the next Day , till he was brought before Justice Dennet ; and that the Prisoner at the Bar is the very Man : And that it can be no Secret to the Sailors that they are Officers when they go on Board , for they are always called by the Name of Partners . Jonathan Crockson , another Officer , deposed to the same Effect . But the Jury , thinking it was incumbent upon them to prove , that they had informed the Prisoner that they were Officers , ( which they had not ) he was acquitted .
