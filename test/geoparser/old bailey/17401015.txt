Charles Brooks . I live in Green-Arbour-Court , in the Little Old-Bailey . The Prisoner had been a Lodger in my House about a Fortnight before the Fact was committed . On the 25th of September I went out to work in the Morning at 6 o'Clock ; I returned between 6 and 7 at Night , and was told I was robb 'd . I advertised the Things I lost , and the next Morning the Prisoner , and part of my Goods , were brought me by a Pawnbroker to whom she had offered them . The rest I fetch 'd , by the Prisoner 's Directions , from another Pawnbroker . Ann Brooks . I went out between 6 and 7 o'clock that Morning , and left the Prisoner and another Lodger in the House . I double lock 'd the Door , and came Home at 7 in the Evening , then the Key turn 'd but once , and the Door flew open . Upon looking into the Kitchen , I found I was robb 'd of the Things mentioned in the Indictment : I charged the Prisoner with taking them , but she said she was not guilty of it ; so I advertised them , and she was stopped with some of the Goods , and brought to our House . The rest she owned she had pawn 'd to a Man in Wych-street . John Sarney . The Prosecuter came to me , and told me he had got a Thief in his House ; I went Home with him ; he charged me with the Prisoner , and these Things were given into my Custody .

I keep the Anchor-Alehouse in White-Friars . On the 27th of September the Prisoner came into my House , and said , we need not thank her for her Custom , for the Rain had sent her there ; she went into the Kitchen , and called for a Pint of Beer , and afterwards asked if we could dress her a Pigeon , which we did ; soon after she went away . She had not been gone three Minutes but I miss 'd a Quart Silver Tankard , which stood on a Table Bedstead in the Place where she was sitting . She had laid her Cloak and Stick down by it , and I am positive that I saw it while she was there . The Prisoner had enquired the Way to Charing-Cross , and my Wife directed her to go through the Temple ; so I pursued her up Glass-house-Alley , but could not overtake her : I then advertis 'd it , and on the Monday Night following , Mr Gosling came and told me had bought it of such a Person as I had described . The next Morning after this , a Man that was in my Fore-Room , and saw the Prisoner come through the Kitchen with my Wife , stopped her and brought her to me . Prisoner . There was a Man in the Kitchen that sells Stockings about the Streets , and several other People , and they might take it as well as I. Gladman . I saw it there after he was gone , and there was nobody else in the Room , but a young Woman , who is a Lodger , and was called down to the Prisoner , because she said she wanted a Servant . Richard Gosling . I bought this Tankard of the Prisoner the same Day , about 2 o'clock , and it answered the Prosecutor 's Description . Francis Trigg . I was at Dinner in the Fore-Room , when Mrs Gladman came to the Door with the Prisoner , to shew her the Way to Charing Cross . I saw her then , and am positive she is the same Person . I met her in the Street the Tuesday following , and took her . She said when I stopped her , that she was not the Woman , and that she knew not the House . Elizabeth Davis . I lodge in the House , Mr Gladman called me down to the Prisoner , who said she wanted a Servant . My Sister , who was out of Place , was not then at home , and the Prisoner promised to call again the next Day . There was nobody in the Room while I was there but the Prisoner , Mrs Gladman , and I ; the Stocking-Man was gone before I came down Stairs , and then I saw 2 Tankards in the Kitchen . Prisoner . The Woman of the House stood talking with me a great while at the Door , before I went away ; and while I was in the Kitchen , there were several People there .

On Sunday Morning , the last Day of August , the Watchman ( Falconer ) brought the Prisoner to me , and charged me with him . I desired him to confess who was with him , when he took the Lead . He said that one Brown , and one Ford , took the Lead from the Alms-houses , rolled it up , and carried it behind the School ; that one of them gave him this Lead , and bid him go forward with it . I carried the Prisoner to the Gate-house , and went to look for the other 2 Men ; but we never could take them : There had been Lead stole from the Alms-houses , and some of this Lead match 'd with the Place ; but he never would tell us where the other came from . Mr Ilsley . I know the Alms-houses to be the Property of the Dean of Westminster , and the Dean of the Chapel-Royal , during the Time of their being Deans ; it is an Estate of 52 l. a Year , Fee-Farm , which was left by Will in the Year 1682 ; and the Alms-houses were left under their Direction , but the Will is not here .

The cloth was dropped within 20 Yards of the Place where he was taken . William Mills , Constable . The Prisoner was taken by my Man , and is the very Person that was delivered to me . Elias Smith . I was standing at my Master 's Door , and heard a cry of Stop Thief ; the Prisoner ran by , I ran after him , and stopped him .

I felt it go , and I immediately cry 'd out ; the Villain has stole my Watch ; I had a Friend with me , who pursued the Prisoner up Cannon-Alley , into Queen 's Head-Alley ; he fell down , we seized him , and saw the Watch lying within a Yard of him . I am sure the Prisoner is the Man ; he never was out of my Sight 'till he was taken . Prisoner . Ask him , whether he was sober at this time ? Swift . I was ; that declares itself , otherwise I could not have missed the Watch so soon . Prisoner . Ask him , if he did not say , he could not tell which of the Men took his Watch ? Swift . No , I always said he was the Person ; I saw his Hand go down to my Pocket , and when he drew it out , I felt him . Prisoner . By what Circumstances is he sure that I am the Man ? Swift .

I am sure the Man that came up to the Prosecutor is the same Person I took ; for there was nobody between him and me all the Pursuit . Prisoner .

I fancy you must be mistaken ; pray do n't take a false Oath : When you saw me in the Compter did you know me ? Frazier . Yes ; and I said , that is the Woman who robb 'd me . John Williamson . I was with the Prosecutor at the White Bear , and then he had his Watch ; we came out together about 5 o'clock , and I left him at the Door with the Prisoner . Elizabeth Morris . I live in Russel-Street ; the Prisoner was my Lodger : I did not see the Prosecutor come in with her , for I was a-bed , but he went out when I was at Dinner . He asked where the Woman was , and told me she had robb 'd him , and I should suffer if I did not take her ; she owed me 4 s. when she went away , and paid me not a Farthing . Prisoner . I know nothing of what the Gentleman accuses me , and the Room was as common to every Body as it was to me ; I have lost several Things out of it myself . Morris . She had a Key to the Door , and might refuse any Body 's coming in . Henrietta Parker . I have known the Prisoner about a Year , and never heard any Thing of this Nature of her before .

The Counsel for the Prosecution set forth , that the Prisoner was a Member of that Set of Men , who go under the Denomination of Gamblers ; the most dangerous Community to the Publick ; that in the Schemes they lay to trap their Neighbours , Providence takes care they shall be ensnar 'd themselves , and fall into that Pit which they dig for others ; and that the Prisoner had now brought himself into the Commission of a Felony , & c. & c. William Silver was called and sworn . Couns . Go to the Bar , and see if you know that Man . Silver . That is the Man : He met me by Milford-Lane , and gave me a Bobb on the Shoulder ; I turn 'd to see who it was , O , says he , I beg your Pardon . I thought it had been somebody else ; but I can hardly believe my Eyes : Pray , What Countryman are you ? I told him I was Berkshire ; Why , says he , I came from High-Wicomb myself : Pray , Who do you know there ? Said I , I know Mr. Bracken , O , said he , I know him very well , he was the last Person I drank with , may , the last Person I spoke to : What Part of Berkshire ? I came ( said I ) from Walgrove ; Did you , said he ? I want to send a Letter to a Person in your Parish , who had a Debt owing him from one in Town who paid him but 2 s. and 6 d. in the Pound , and is now in such Circumstances , that I believe I can get him the remainder ; and if you will carry it , I will give you half a Pint of Wine ; so we went into the Feathers-Tavern , he asked me if I would not smoak half a Pipe with him , I said , I did not care if I did ; and as we were lighting our Pipes , he stooped down , and took up a Paper ; he then said somebody had had very bad Luck , and wished the Owner had it ; Do n't carry it away , said I , but leave it at the Bar ; then , said he , I 'll pawn it for a Pint of Wine . In a little Time another Man came , and peeped in at the Door : the Prisoner asked him what he meant by coming into a private Room ; I ask Pardon , said he , but I had the Misfortune to drop a Paper here just now ; What is it , says the Prisoner ? It is a Receipt for 200 l. Why , says the Prisoner , I was just going to mortgage it at the Bar for a Pint of Wine ; the other Man immediately threw down a Shilling for it , and was going away , but the Prisoner stopped him , and said , he should take Part of the Wine ; on his Persuasion he sat down . He said he had been at a Cock Match , that the Landlord of the House told him one particular Cock was better than such a one , and persuaded him to lay a Wager on it 's Head , which he did , and lost ; but the Landlord was his Friend , and laid down the Money for him . Before we had drank the Wine out , the Stranger turned himself about , and took a pack of Cards out of the Window , and he and the Prisoner sell to shewing Tricks with them ; the other Man pulled a Card out of the middle , and said , Now I will tell you what that Card is before I see it , and I 'll lay you a 100 l. that I tell any Card in the Pack ; the Prisoner thereupon fetched 20 l. and told it down on the Table , and called me out , and desired me to lend him some Money to make his up ; There will be no Damage , ( said he ) only tender it down , and keep it in your own Hand ; for I may as well win the Fool 's Money as another . I told him I had not above a Shilling in my Pocket ; he asked me if I could not borrow some to lend him , I told him , No ; but he over-persuaded me , and I went to one Davis 's , where I got 25 l. 12 s. and 6 d. and to Mr Ford 's , and had 30 l. Coming back he desired me to go in at Bishop 's , at the Fleece below St Paul 's , that we might tell the Money , and see how much was wanting to make it up 80 l. There were 10 l. wanting , which he said he could borrow of a Friend just by ; he put his Money into my Bag with that which I had borrowed , and I put it on the Table by me . I happened to turn my Head , and in that Time he changed my Bag for another like it , and left me under pretence of going to get the Remainder of the Money . I waited some Time , and he not returning , I examined the Bag , and found in it only Half-a-crown's-worth of Halfpence , and some pieces of Lead . Couns . Who was to have the Bag , before the Wager was laid ? Silver . I was to keep the Money , and had it in my possession till it was taken away . When he had put his Money into my Bag , I put it on the Table before me , and I am sure there was nobody else in the Room , but the Maid , who brought in a Pint of Beer . Couns . What became of the Stranger ? Silver . We left him at the Feathers , while we went for the Money . I never saw him afterwards . Couns . Was you to have any Part of this Wager ? Silver . No : The Wager was between the Prisoner and the Stranger , I had nothing at all to do with it . Couns . On your Oath , Was your Money ever in the Prisoner 's Custody ? Silver . Not , till it was taken away by him . Prisoner 's Q . How came you to borrow Money for a Person you knew nothing of ? Suppose the Stranger had won , Who was to have had the Money ? Silver . The Prisoner said it was impossible he should ; but if it had happened otherwise , he ought to have made it good . Couns . What was the Prisoner 's Money , Gold or Silver ? Silver . There was some Gold , and some Silver , but I ca n't say what Pieces they were . His Money and mine were mixed , and told together . The Counsel for the Prisoner , here made an Objection in Point of Law . That as the Money was borrowed to serve the Prisoner , and as the Prosecutor depended upon him for the Re-payment of it , this Fact could not be deem 'd Felony . In Answer to which it was urged , by the Counsel for the Prosecution ; That this was one of the worst Sort of Felonies , and a Case in which the Publick are greatly concern 'd : That this Money never having been lent to the Prisoner , nor was to have been entrusted in his custody , it must be deem 'd a felonious taking . That a Person having taken a Ring off his Finger , at the Request of another , for him to see it , his going off with it had been adjudged Felony . The Court were of Opinion this Indictment was not well laid ; but the Prisoner was ordered to remain in custody , unless he could find sufficient Sureties to appear , to take his Trial for the Fraud . Acquitted . 454 . + Cane Savage , of St James Clerkenwell , was indicted for breaking and entring the House of Elizabeth Quant , between the Hours of 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , no Person being therein , and stealing 6 Guineas , the Money of Elizabeth Quant , October 4 .

John Savage , the Prisoner 's Father . The Boy had the Misfortune to hurt his Arm , and after that he never was locked up . He did own it before the Justice , but they brought him in crying , and he told them he would say any thing . James Savage . I am his Brother , he came to my House when he hurt his Arm , and he has kept most within Doors ever since . Sarah Cross . I have known him 3 or 4 Years ; and never knew him to be guilty of any thing in my Life . Elizabeth Laurence .

The Prisoner lived with me three Months as a Servant . On the 18th of September I had Occasion to go to my Bureau , and on looking over my Money , I missed 15 l. 4 s.

I told her , I had lost Money ; but she said , she knew nothing of it , and persisted in a Denial of it , till the 20th , and then she own 'd that she had taken the Money , and had filled the Bag with Stones , and thrown it down the Vault , where it was afterwards found by one of my Servants .

Were there not some odd Methods made use of to discover the Thief ? Carpenter .

I imagined that the Person that was guilty should pass by without touching the Table , for fear of being blacked . This was done without Mrs Hewitt 's Knowledge . Sarah Wright .

This Examinant faith , that on Sunday the 7th instant , about 8 or 9 in the Evening , a Woman asked him to shew her a Lodging , for that she intended to go for Worcestershire the next Morning : And then this Examinant shewed her to Mr Life 's Barn , in Horn-Lane , in Acton , where he opened a Truss of Hay for her to lie on , and then left her ; at which Time , the said Woman desired him not to tell any body that she was there : And this Examinant went to the House of one Cannon , in Acton , where he met with Henry Richards , John Wolfe , and Jack at the Captain 's ; that they were all going home , when they met with John Davis , and George Curtis , alias Tug-mutton : That this Examinant having told Jack at the Captain 's , that he had put a Woman into Mr Life 's Barn , they all ( except this Examinant ) whispered together ; that then the said George Curtis said , that he would go and shew them a Girl in a Barn ; that then they all agreed to go together , and found the Woman ; Tug-mutton then ask 'd who was there ? the Woman replied , A poor Soul ! do n't meddle with me ? Curtis put his Hands several Times up the Woman 's Clothes , and swore , if she did not hold her Tongue , he would kill her . The Woman said she was pox 'd ; Curtis replied , pox 'd , or pox 'd not , by G - d I will - . Curtis then , with the Assistance of the Examinant , and of the rest , had Carnal Knowledge of her ; during which , the Woman cried out Murder several Times . Then John Davis swore , if she would not give up to him , he would kill her ; the Woman cried out Murder ! for God 's Sake do n't kill me ! Davis thrust a Pin . of the Length of about an Inch and half , into her hinder-part , up to the Head , and beat her with his Fist : After he had done with her , Henry Richards lay with her ; and then John James , alias Jack at the Captain 's ; then John Wolfe ; and lastly , this Examinant . After this George Curtis got upon the Woman again , and swore , if she would not give him what Money she had , he would kill her ; the Woman answered , for God 's Sake ! do n't kill me , I will give you my Money ! but she not giving it soon , Curtis beat the Woman with his Hands , and Captain Jack swore he would kill her ; then Curtis cut off the Woman 's Pocket , and took out of it Two-pence Three farthings , and a Pass , which she said , she had to travel with ; that they then all went to the Star in Acton , where they proposed to drink together ; but this Examinant having no Money , they told him , he should not go with them ; whereupon he left them , and went home , between 2 and 3 o'clock on Monday Morning . In the Account of what passed between himself and the Woman , and of what each of the others had declar 'd , such Terms were used , as fully denoted the Offence to be a Rape in each . Samuel Lock . The Day before the Woman * died , I went up to the Barn to see her : She did not say any thing in particular against the Prisoner . I asked her whether she had been ill used ? she said , they had ravished her against her Will , and had robbed her of almost Half a Crown , and Six-pence , but she did not know any of them , for it was in the Dark ; and she believed she could not live over the Night . * The Coroner 's Inquest sat on the Body September 19 , but not agreeing on a Verdict , adjourned to October 10 , when they brought in a Verdict that she died a Natural Death . John Chester . This Curtis lay in Mr Franklin 's Barn : I asked him where he had been , and he told + me , that they had found a Woman in a Barn , and had lain with her . + George Curtis , otherwise Tug-mutton , was committed by Sir Joseph Ayloffe , for this Rape , on his own Confession : He died in Newgate on the Day he was to have been tried with Duell , - John James , otherwise Jack at the Captain 's , was apprehended October 19 . - The others are not yet taken . John Weston . On Monday the 14th of September , I went , by Sir Joseph Ayloffe 's Orders , to Mr Life 's Barn , to see this Woman : I asked her how many Boys there were ? she said there were 6 or 7 , that they had lain with her against her Will , and robb 'd her , and beat her with their Hands and Knees . She likewise said , that Duell was the Boy who shew 'd her into the Barn , and afterwards came with the others ; and that they had used her so ill , that she was light-headed . Prisoner . I had not a Farthing of the Money , for the Boys beat me about sadly . The Prisoner 's Mother . He never did an ill thing in his Life before ; he is not seventeen Years old .

The Prisoner , when he lived with us , was very poor ; but after this Robbery he went pretty tight . Ann Wilson . The Woman Prisoner came to me , a Week after Whitsuntide , and said , that her Brother Robert would give her a pair of Sheets , which were in pawn , if she would fetch them out ; and if I would lend her 3 s. she would fetch them . She got the Sheets , and left them at my House till she could pay me ; she went away with her Husband , and I saw no more of her till she was taken .

When she was committed to New-Prison , I went to see her , and she told me that she was not at the breaking the Locks . A Woman .

Before McCormock was robbed , he had only two old Shirts to his Back , but afterwards he fetched his clothes out of Pawn , and began to be very tight . John McCormock . I went out between 9 and 10 in the Morning , with my Coach ; I came Home between 1 and 2 the next Morning , and my Neighbours told me there was bad News ; I could not believe it till I got up Stairs , and then I saw the Drawers open , and my Goods were gone This half Sheet was found on Mrs Wilson , who had it from the Woman Prisoner . Ann McCormock . I left this Sheet on the Bed when I went out ; I am sure it is the same , for the cloth was very thin , and I had overcast it . Prisoner Robert . These Sheets were in pawn four Months before the Robbery ; I paid Half a crown and 4 d. for them . Prisoner Hannah .

Catherine Cunningham . I keep a Shop in Bloomsbury . On Thursday last , about 3 in the Afternoon , this Mary Mills , and another Woman who is not taken , came to my Shop to buy a Yard and half of Cotton , for a child 's frock ; they were very difficult to please , but at last bought some , and paid for it . The Woman , who bought the cotton , had not Money enough to pay for it , but borrowed a Shilling of Mills ; first they disputed about the Price , and were going away , but came back again , and found an Opportunity to take this piece of cotton away . I had shewn them this very piece among others , and did not miss it 'till the Prisoner Hall was brought back ; Mills was taken at the Door , but the other Woman crossed Bloomsbury-Market , and got off . The next Witness , observing what had passed , went after them , and took Hall with my Goods in her Apron . Mary Cresswell . I keep an Herb-Stall opposite to Mrs Cunningham 's , and saw the Prisoner Mills , and another Woman , in the Shop , looking over divers Goods , and seemed to be very difficult : they both came out of the Shop , made a Stand , and went back again , the other Woman towards the Shop-Door , and Mills went towards a Gateway . The Prisoner Hall was then standing on the other Side of the Way ; Mills beckoned to her to go under the Gateway ; she did so , and Mills followed her ; Hall immediately held up her Apron , Mills turned something into it , and went back to the Shop to the other Woman , who still remained there . Hall was going off , but I slipped after her , took hold of her , and said , she must come back with me ; she asked me what she must go back for , I said , she had got something in her Apron , she said , she had not ; so I took hold of her Apron , and found this piece of cotton in it , before several Neighbours . I carried her back to the Shop , and saw the Prisoner Mills waiting at the Door for the other Woman , a Constable was sent for , and the 2 Prisoners secured , but the other Woman walked away . Prisoner Mills . Ask her if I offered to go away . Cresswell . No ; but I saw her put the cotton into Hall 's Apron . Mills .

Hall . I was newly come out of my Time , so I went to get me a Place ; I met this Woman ( who is gone off ) in Holbourn , and she hired me , and said , that she bought and sold old cloaths . She went into this Shop , and brought out this thing to me , and when Cresswell came up to me , to ask me what I had got , I told her , nothing but what my Mistress had given me . - I have not one Friend to come near me , to speak for me .

I saw the Prisoner run a-cross the Yard , and we took him . When we had seized him , we went up Stairs to see what had been done ; and found that Lead had been cut out of the Gutter , but how much I ca n't tell . The House , from whence this Lead was taken , belongs to Mr Maylin , as one of the Assignees of Richard Johnson , a Bankrupt . Daniel Draper . I was drinking at Bradley 's , when I heard that there was a Thief in this House . Bromley , Bradley , and I , went to the House , and as soon as we were got in , the Prisoner try 'd to escape over the Pales . I heard a Noise of something running , and threw a Bit of Wood at him in the dark ; but that not hitting him , I ran up to him , and took him , just as he was getting over the Pales to go away . After he was sent to New Prison , we searched the House , and found Part of the Leaden Gutter cut away ; and the next Morning going into the Yard , I saw that the Main Pipe was taken from the Front of the House , in the Yard . Thomas Bromley . On Wednesday Night , coming out of the Publick House , I was told , that some Men were taking my Master 's Deals . I went down the Alley , the Back-way , but Bradley and Draper went the Fore-way .

The next Morning we found a Piece of Leaden Pipe , about 5 Foot long , which was taken from the Front of the House . Prisoner .

Mr. Jones . On the 17th of September , I was standing with a Man in Fleet-Street , and the Prisoner passed me several Times : I could not imagine what the Fellow wanted , and I resolved to stop him , if he came by me again . He passed me , and I ran after him , and took him to the Sugar Loaf Alehouse , and gave him into the Custody of the next Witness . I found these 8 Handkerchiefs concealed about several Parts of his Body . - He could give no Account how he came by them , nor say any thing for himself , or his Character . Mark Bushell . All that I have to say is , that it was about half an Hour-past 8 , when Mr Jones brought the Prisoner into the Sugar-Loaf Alehouse . Prisoner . Was you there ? Bushell . Yes , I was . Prisoner . Very well then . Bushell . He had one Handkerchief taken from one Arm-pit , another from the other , and so from several Parts of his Body , and were all separate . Prisoner . The Case is this . I was coming from a Place , - what do you call it ? - by Fleet-street , where they sell Saloop , my Ship-mate met me , and we went into a House , and drank 2 Full-pots of Beer ; he gave me these Handkerchiefs , that my Wife might wash them for him , and that Man took them from me : I know no more of them . Here are some Witnesses to my Character and Behaviour . Mary Margaret . I have known him above 20 Years , I never knew any Harm by him in my Life ; I ca n't say as for hearing , - but we are not to go by Hear-say . What he is taken up for , I ca n't say nothing ( any thing ) in his Behalf ; I have heard no ill of him , any farther than as People have said , that he has been a wild young Man . I have 'trusted him , and never lost any thing by him . Jury . Have you ever heard that he gets a Livelihood by stealing ? Margaret . I ca n't say - I have heard - but I can prove nothing against him . He goes to Sea , but he is not always at Sea . I never lost any thing by him . Ann Stanford . I never knew much of him , his Wife , I believe maintains him : I knew him when he was a Seaman on board the Hampton-Court : but I have not seen him these 2 Years till now . Mary Margaret again .

October 5 . Martha Swinney . I live in Wild-Passage , near Drury Lane . On the 5th of this Month , I went out at 3 o'clock , and left the Prisoner in my Room . I left my Things all safe , and bid her go out , and take the Key of the Door with her . I return 'd at 5 o'clock , and found my Door lock 'd ; but the Key was left in the inside . I asked my Neighbours , whether they had seen the Prisoner go out ? and was told , that she was gone , and had carried a large Bundle out with her . I immediately gave notice to several Pawnbrokers , to stop my Goods , if they should be offered to pawn , and accordingly , Mr Johnson , in Wych-street , stopped 2 Coats , which were brought to him by a Woman , who had them from the Prisoner . She confessed , before Mr Justice Frazier , that she took these two Petticoats , which were not quite finish 'd , and one which was almost made up , and that she had left the Shift and Apron at Rebecca Rines 's ; but the Handkerchief she dropped , as she was going along . - Freer . On the 6th of October , Rebecca Rines brought 2 quilted Petticoats to our Shop to pawn ; My Master was not at home , so I stopped them , and gave Notice to Mrs Swinney .

Rebecca Rines . The Prisoner came to my House , and asked me to let her lie there ? I told her , she was welcome if she pleased . I asked her what she had got in her Apron ? She said , she had got some Petticoats , and would be glad if I would pawn them for her ; I told her , I would , and accordingly I carried them to Mr Johnson 's , in Wych street ; they asked me where I had them ?

John Clack . My Place was broke open the 17th Day of last Month , while I was a-bed . When I arose , I was in a great Fright to see what was done ; I found the Door broke open , and I am very sure it was shut fast , and double-locked over Night , with a Padlock on the outside , and a good Stock-Lock on the inside . These Men will make you sensible that I found a great many of my Goods again , though not all . The Goods which are here are mine , I am on my Oath , and I would swear a hundred Oaths that they are mine , and that I lost them at that Time , for I left them in my cellar when I went to Bed . The Prisoners were taken the same Morning at this Man 's House ; there were four of them , but one is made an Evidence , and the other is got away . When they were apprehended , they owned that they had a Hand in breaking my Place open , and here is the Adz they did it with . There is a Woman , who is out on Bail , has got part of my Goods , and when I was called out of Bed , I went with the Officers to her House , suspecting that the Man , who got away , was there ; we desired the People of the House to open the Door , but they said they could not find the Key , and kept us on the outside a Quarter of an Hour before they would let us in , and in that Time I imagine they let him out . When we got into the House , I found a Wastcoat of mine , and a great many other Things tumbled down the Stairs , and those I took away . I have been very badly used , for they have taken away my Substance , and ruined me . Prisoners . Will he swear that we did it ? Clack . No ; I ca n't swear that any one of them did it , but here is their Accomplice . Charles Wood . I was drinking last Wednesday Night was a Month , at Mr Phillip 's Gin-shop in Rag-Fair , and this Man that is run away , and the Prisoner , asked me to go out with them . We went to the Prosecutor 's , and the Man who is gone broke the Door open with this Adz , there were two Locks to it ; I stood by while he did it ; the biggest of the Prisoners went down into the cellar , and brought up the Goods , and that little Man and I carried some of them to Harman 's House , and some to Mrs Carlow 's , who is out on Bail . When we went to Harman 's House , he said he would fetch us some Bread and Cheese , and Beer ; but instead of Victuals he brought the Watch and Constable . Prisoner Madder . Ask him , whether he did not come to me when I was asleep , and bid me get up ? Wood . No , I never saw him asleep at all . Valentine Harman . The 2 Prisoners , the Evidence , and one more , came to my House on the 17th of September , between 1 and 2 in the Morning ; each of them had his Arm full of Clothes ; I asked them where they had them , and they made me no Answer ; I tapp 'd the least of the Prisoners [ Clack ] on the Shoulder , and he told me that they had them from Rag-Fair , and were going for more : they went away , and I called my Neighbour up , and told him that I believed the Things were stole . He came with me , and when they knocked at the Door , I shut him into a closet that they might not see him ; they came in , and laid down their Bundles , and said one to another , Let us go to Carlow 's , and fetch the Things from thence , for there are as many there , as there are here ; they were going again , but that little Man said , let us have some Victuals and Drink first ; I told them , if they would go up Stairs into my 1 pair of Stairs Room , I would knock up the People at the Anchor ; and then I let my Friend out of the closet . I went immediately to the Watchman , he got me an Officer , and we secured three of them , and carried them to the Watch-house ; but the other Man went away , pretending to call his Wife . We called up Mr Clack , and went to Carlow 's , suspecting that he was there , and when we got in , we saw several Things lying about , which Mr. Clack owned . Clack . The Goods which were at Harman 's , were brought to the Watch-house to me , and I knew them to be mine , and what I lost that Night . Thomas Revel . I was the Constable . Between one and two in the Morning , Harman called me out of Bed , and said , that he had got some Goods which were left at his House by Thieves . I went home with him : He shewed me as many Things as a Horse could carry , and on going up Stairs , I saw the 2 Prisoners on one Bed , and the Evidence on another . I took hold of the Evidence , and after we had searched him and the Prisoners , and found nothing on them but this Adz , we sent them to a little Place we have , called the Bail-Dock . There were as many Cloaths afterwards brought to the Watch-house , as would load a Horse , they were shewn to Clack the Prosecutor , and he owned them . The Prisoners confessed before the Justice , that they had been into the Man 's Cellar . John Man . I am a Watchman ; and going to beat my Rounds , Harman came to me , Jack ( said he ) I want a Constable , for some Fellows have brought Goods to my House , which I believe are stole ; I got an Officer , and went to his House , where I saw these Men , and a great Quantity of Cloaths . We secured them , and went to Carlow 's , and brought the Goods away which were there . Prisoner Madder . These Men came to me while I was asleep , and asked me what I did there ; I told them , I was just laid down because I had no Money ; they bid me get up , and go with them . I did so , and stood off at a Distance ; they brought out Cloaths , and I took them ; we carried them to this Man 's House , and they said , they did it for fear the Beadle should take them away . I never was in a Prison before . John Cundell . I knew the Prisoner Madder 's Friends very well , and never heard any Harm of him . His Father kept the Woolpack at St. Edmund 's Bury , and was a very honest Man ; the Prisoner is but lately come to Town . Mary Cundell . I have known him from his Infancy , and always thought him a very honest , just Boy . I know his Friends to be very honest . He was brought up to no Trade , but sent to Sea ; I believe he might be out 2 Years , but I do n't know in what Manner he has lived since he was at Sea . He brought me a Letter them his Mother about a Year and half ago , and I have never then him since till now . I received another Letter from his Mother about three Weeks ago , but she takes no notice of him in it , any farther , than that he was come up to Town . A Witness . I knew the Prisoner Madder at Bury , and his Father and Mother were very honest People . I was told that he never was in the Man 's cellar . Accomplice . He entered the House with us , and helped us to carry the Goods to Harman 's House . The Jury found both the Prisoners Guilty , Death ; but desired the Intercession of the Court , that Madder might be transported . 497 + Margaret Stanton , otherwise Ruggetty Madge , of St. Martin in the Fields , was indicted ( with Catherine Butler not taken ) for assaulting Benjamin Parish , in the House of Edmund Cahoe , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , val . 3 l. 10 s. a pair of Silver Knee-buckles , a Holland Shirt , a pair of Breeches , three Portugal Pieces , 1 Moidore , 14 Guineas , and 6 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of Benjamin Parish , October 8 . Benjamin Parish . On the 8th of October instant , about 12 o'clock at Night , I was going to enquire after my Wife 's Brother , at Mr. Fulman 's , in Windsor-Court , Drury-Lane . I went close by the Door where the Prisoner and the other Woman were standing , and this Woman at the Bar said , Countryman , I want to speak with you ; I could not refuse , as I was so close to them , so they laid their Hands , one on one Arm , the other on my other , and with the Assistance of somebody behind , pull 'd me down on my Back , into the House of one Edmund Cahoe , which is a Den of Thieves . As soon as I came into the Door - the House is not above 8 Paces long - I was no sooner within the Door , but it was shut on me , and , as I am inform 'd , Butler was the Woman who kneel 'd on my Breast , and held my Arms , I am sure some Woman did . The Prisoner kneel 'd on my Legs , so that I lay like a dead Man ; she forced open my Breeches Pocket , as you see , [ they were Leather Breeches , and torn down the Side ] and took out about 23 Guineas in Gold , and some Silver , my Watch , and a Pair of Silver Knee-buckles , and out of my Great Coat Pocket , a Pair of Breeches , and a Holland Shirt , my Hat and Wig from my Head . When I first came in , I could discern a great many Men in the House , I cried Murder ! as loud as I was able , but none came to my Assistance . As soon as they had robbed me , they opened the Door , and I went away , designing to go to my Inn ; but I met a Watchman who pretended to shew me the Way thither , and instead of going the right Way with me , carried me to the Cart and Horse , in St Giles 's , where some Irishmen made me drunk , so that I did not get to my Inn till Morning . After this I went to Fulman 's , in the same Court where I was robbed , and they advis 'd me to be easy ; Mrs Fulman told me that there was a Person who would give me 15 Guineas , and my other Things should be laid down in the House , if I would be quiet , but she would not tell who it was . When I found that I could not command any thing , I gave a Fellow a Crown to discover the People who had robbed me , and I took the Prisoner , and charged her with the same before the Justice , as I have now . She own 'd that she was in the House ; but that Butler had the Money , and one Shields the Watch , and she was innocent . Prisoner . What Hour of the Night was it ? Parish . About 12 o'clock . Prisoner . He swore before the Justice that it was between 8 and 9 . I beg you would ask him in particular , whether I was the Woman who brought him into the House ? I do n't deny that I saw him him in the House . Parish . She was one of the Women who was standing at the Door , and pull 'd me into the House . The Justice . The Evidence which the Prosecutor has given now , is exactly the same Word for Word , as that which he swore before me . He said that it was between 11 and 12 , and that the Prisoner was the Person who rifled his Pockets . When she was before me , she acknowledg 'd that she was present ; but said that she had no Part of the Money . Prisoner . It is proper if I took the Money , that I should have some Share of it . There is a Man in the Gate-house , and I think he ought to be brought before my Life or Liberty is taken away . My Friends are not here , and I have not a Half-penny to save me .

On the 29th of September , I was sent for to Whetstone ; and returning to London , about a Quarter before 7 in the Evening , I was stopped between the 7 and 8 Mile Stone , on Finchley-Common , by a Person on a little Bay Poney ; who it was , I ca n't say , for it was Night . I was on a Bay Mare which belonged to William Davis . The Man who stopped me , presented a Pistol , and swore he would shoot me through the Body , if I did not give him my Money ; I was very much terrified , and he took from me a Half-Guinea , two Half-Crowns , 6 d. and a pair of Silver Buckles ; he likewise took the Mare which I rode , and left me his in the Room . After this was done , he went toward the Right-hand of the Common ; the Mare was advertised , and the Prisoner taken upon her ; but whether he is the Person that robbed me , I ca n't tell . I ca n't say but the Prisoner may be about the Size of the Man who attack 'd me . Prisoner . He advertised the Mare , and I picked her up . John Kerton . On the Thursday after the Robbery was committed , a Boy at Barnet told me , that a Man had stolen a Mare , and was upon her about 200 Yards off ; I went after him , but missed Sight of him , and coming back I met a Man , who was likewise in pursuit of him ; he desired me to go with him , I did so , and we met the Prisoner on the Mare . We seized him with the Assistance of one or two more , and pulled him off the Mare , down on his Back . When we first took hold of him , he swore he would shoot the next Man that touched him ; upon that we searched him for Arms , and found 2 Brace of Pistols loaded in his Pockets , and a Hanger concealed under his coat ; not visible to any Body . I did not see his Pistols before he was taken , if I had , I should have been cautious of touching him . We tied his Hands , and carried him to Whetstone , and sent for the Man who was robbed , but he could only swear to the Mare . The Prisoner said , before the Justice , that he was in Debt , and carried those Arms about him only for his Guard . These are the Pistols , and one of them we found loaded . Thomason . I saw this Mare which the Prisoner was taken upon , and is the same that was taken from me . Prisoner . Ask Kerton , whether I behaved like such a Man when he seized me ? Kerton . When he was pulled down on his Back , and could do nothing , he said he was in Debt . The Man looked to have no Harm in him . The Pistols were in his Pockets , the Hanger was under his Coat , and not visible to any Body . George Christmas . I pursued the Prisoner , having had a Description of the Mare , and desired another Man to help me . I assisted in taking him , and saw the Pistols taken out of his Pockets , and the Hanger from under his Coat . He said , he was not afraid of any Thing we could do to him , for he was in Debt , and carried those Arms about him for his own Safety . Samuel Wheeler . I was at the taking of the Prisoner , he said when he was down , he had no Occasion to fear any Body , and if we would let him get up , he would go any where with us . We asked him how he came by the Mare , and he said , that he found her on the Common . I saw the Pistols taken out of his Pockets , and the Hanger from under his coat . Defence . On Thursday Morning I was going to gather Mushrooms , and saw this Mare bridled and sadled upon the Common ; she was advertised , reasonable charges born , and no Questions asked , but I ca n't tell what Paper it was in . Thomason . The Mare was advertised , to be left at the Axe-Inn in Aldermanbury . Kerton . When we took him he was in a back Road , and said he was going to Enfield . Mary Sanders . I live at Enfield : The Prisoner lay at my House Tuesday and Wednesday , he is no Relation , only a Friend . I have known him a great while , he is a Leather-Cutter , and lives at Stratford . When he came to my House he was on Foot , and carried away a Pair of Boots , which my Husband wanted to be done . I do n't know where he was on the Monday . Robert Sanders . I have known the Prisoner these 8 Years , he is a Cordwainer , and keeps a House at Stratford : I live in Shoreditch Parish . He was with me on Sunday about Noon , and said he was going to a Christening to his Wife . On the Monday he din 'd with me at Haggerstone : he left me between 1 and 2 in the Afternoon , and said he was going to Enfield . I know him to be very honest , but in Debt . He was very shy of the Bailiffs , and I know that he has had a Hanger and Pistols a pretty while , but I saw none on him when he was at my House . I have seen him have them sometimes , and when he has come in , he used to lay them down , and take them up when he went away . I take him to be very honest , as far as I know . Thomas Hodson . I knew him when he was 6 or 7 Years old his Father and Mother are very honest People , and as for being in Debt , I know he was . Thomas Harvey . I live at Stratford . I know this poor young Fellow ; he has ( been ) absconded from his Family a long while , but I never heard of his Dishonesty . Zaccheus Bourne . I have had Knowledge of the Prisoner some Years , and never heard any thing a miss of him in my Life . I am Beadle of Aldgate Parish , and his Father lives in Aldgate Parish now , and is a Man of Reputation . John Organ . I have known him between 6 and 7 Years , and have served him with Bread ; he has a great Family , and I always thought him a very honest young Man . Thomas Stevens . I have known him about 6 Years , and took him to be a very honest , industrious Man . I serv 'd him with Shoes , and all the Time I dealt with him he behaved well . Anthony Spire . I have known him between 6 and 7 Years , and he always bore a very good Character : I never heard any thing amiss of him , his Father is a very honest Man . The Jury withdrew for some time to consider of their Verdict , when they found him Not Guilty . 499 , 500 . + Thomas Bates , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , Tobacconist , and Elizabeth Bates , of the same , Widow , were indicted , for that they feloniously and falsely made , and caused to be made and procured , a certain Writing , sealed with the Name of Henry Sandys , purporting to be the last Will of the said Henry Sandys , in the Words and Figures following , viz . In the Nam of God , Amen : I Henry Sandys , of the Parish of St. Giles in the Fields , Painter , being somewhat infirm , & c. do make and ordain this my Last Will and Testament , commending my Soul to the Creator , and my Body to the Earth , to be decently interr 'd , & c. my Temporal Estate I dispose as follows , my Debts being first paid . Imprimis , I give and bequeath to Frances Woodward , the Sum of 80 l. to be paid in Quarterly Payments ; the first Payment to be made the Quarter Day after my Decease ; and in case she die before the same be fully paid , then the Remainder shall be divided among the Children of Richard Sandys . Item , I give and bequeath to Bridget Grimes , my Sister-in-law , 10 l. To John Grimes . 5 l. Item , I give and bequeath to Matthew Roberts my Brother-in law , and Mr. John Harris , One Guinea to buy Rings . Item , I give and bequeath to the Children of Elizabeth Sandys , 20 l. Item I give and bequeath to the Children of Richard Sandys 40 l. a-piece , at 21 Years of Age ; and in case any of them die , their Parts to be divided among the Survivors of them . Item , I give to Francis Roberts the Sum of 30 l. Item , I give to Elizabeth Bates the Interest of 500 l. out of my South-Sea Stock , for her natural Life , and her Husband shall not intermeddle there-with , but it shall be for her own Maintenance , without Controul of her said Husband ; and I give the said Principal 500 l. among the Children of my Brother Sandys ; and in case any happen to die , then their Share shall be divided among the Survivors of them . Item , I give to Thomas Bates 10 l. for his Care and trouble in executing the same Will . All the rest not bequeathed , or disposed , I give to Elizabeth Bates , to enjoy the same during her natural Life ; and after her Decease , it shall go among the Children of Richard Sandys . And I do hereby appoint Thomas Bates , and Elizabeth Bates , joint Executors of this my Last Will and Testament , revoking all former Wills whatsoever by me made . In Witness whereof , I have set my Hand and Seal , in the Fourth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord George the Second , & c. Henry Sandys . Sign 'd , seal 'd and declared in the Presence of Alexander Andrews , and Richard Curtis . With Intent to defraud John Grimes , & c. They were a second Time indicted for publishing the said Will , knowing it to be forged , false , and counterfeit , April 7 . The Counsel for the Prosecution set forth , that the Prisoners were indict ed on a late Act for Forgery ; and that this Prosecution was set on foot , to bring to Punishment two Persons , who had offended against the Act , in publishing a Will for a true one , which when it was looked on , would appear to be a manifest Erasure . That there was no positive Evidence against the Prisoners , of their forging this Will ; and without that it would be hard to say they were guilty of it ; but that the Crime of publishing it , knowing it to be forged , is equally the same ; and if the two Prisoners should happen to be guilty of that only , it would be within the Meaning of the Statute . It was farther observed on the same Side ; that as transactions of this Nature are of the worst Consequence to the Publick , where People are so hardy as to alter Mens Wills , to alter the Sums , to increase or diminish them ; so there was an absolute Necessity for putting a severer Punishment on the Crime . That a Will was made by Mr. Sandys , and the old Gentleman having had Prosperity in the World , did intend to make an equal Distribution of his Effects , and consider all his Relations . That it happened some Time before this , that Mr. Sandys was afflicted with Blindness , so that he could not write : I hat he was got into the Hands of an artful Woman , one of the Prisoners , and nothing was done without her Consent ; and that the 2 Prisoners prevailed so much over him , that he made them Executors of his Will . That some little time before his Death , as his Relation Mr Grimes , was a Man of worth , he had taken an Affection to him . and had promised him a Legacy ; and that it would be proved , that the Old Man declared before his Death , that he had left Mr Grimes 50 l. That Mr Sandys dying soon after , no one was privy to it , but the 2 Prisoners , and they never gave notice of it to any of the Relations ; but Mr Grimes afterwards hearing of his Uncle 's Death , went to the Prisoners ; that he asked them , why they did not let him know , that he might come and search ; that the Prisoner Thomas Bates reply 'd , `` there is `` no Occasion for that , for I am one Executor , `` and here is the other , ( meaning Mrs Bates ) he `` has left you 5 l. and here is the Will . '' That Bates then produced a Will , and on Inspection , there appeared to have been a manifest Erasure , and in another Hand , a 5 put in the Place . It was again observed , that the ink on this alteration was fresh , the Sand was on the 5 , and crumbled off when touched . That Mr Grimes was tender of what he did , and went to Curtis , who was then in Goal , and enquired of him whether there had been any Directions given about the alteration of the Will ; that Curtis owned , that he had some time before made a Will for this Mr Sandys , and that it was a Rule with him , when he made an alteration on an Erasure , he always made a Memorandum on the Back . That this gave a strong Presumption , and put Mr Grimes on sifting into the thing , and when the Man came to be buried , a Person came to Mr Grimes for Wine , and entered into Discourse with him about this Will , and said that Mr Bates sent for him , the Day after the Man died , to break open a Box ; that he did open the Box , and saw the Will in the same Condition , as when given to Mr Grimes . It was likewise offered , that on examining this Will , it appeared that the 5 in several other Places was wrote in a different Manner , which could not be done by Mr Sandys himself , because he was blind ; that notwithstanding this , it was insisted on by the Prisoners Thomas Bates , that the writing was all the same , but it would be proved that he saw the Sand fresh on the 5 , and must know that somebody had made an Erasure . That as this was a Case wherein Life was concerned , it required the strictest proof to be given , and it was presumed that what should be offered against the Prisoners , would be a sufficient Proof of the Publication , and within the Act of Parliament . Mr Grimes sworn . It was here urged on the Part of the Defendants , that it appeared from the Face of the Indictment , that Mr Grimes was a Party interested in the Cause , therefore could not be a legal Evidence . The Case of Mr Barton * , who was prosecuted by one Collins for forging a Bond , ( where the Court was of Opinion that Collins could not be an Evidence ) and William Judd for a promissory Note , were mentioned as Cases of the same Nature with this . * See his Trial in the Sessions Book for April last , p. 133 . No . 231 . In Answer to which , it was said by the Counsel for the Prosecution , that the Cases which had been mentioned were quite different from this , for if Mr Grimes should give Evidence , it would be to over-throw the Will , then consequently he could have no Part of the Man 's Estate , and would swear to his own Prejudice , therefore must be allowed to destroy his own Interest . On the Part of the Defendants it was offered in reply , that this was not an Answer to the Objection , for , according to the Tenour of the Indictment , his Testimony would be to prove that there had been an alteration in the Will , from 50 to 5 , to his Prejudice ; and if that should be proved , the Court of Equity would give him what was originally intended him . Upon the whole , it was the Opinion of the Court that Mr Grimes was a Party interested , therefore could not be admitted a legal Witness . Couns . We call Mr Justice De Veil to prove that the Will was produced before him , and that the Prisoner Thomas Bates , insisted on it , that it was a true Will . Mr De Veil . This Will was produced before me , in order to take out a Warrant for the Prisoner , but he came without . Mr Grimes brought the Will . Couns . When the Prisoner was before you , did not he say that it was a true Will ? Mr De Veil . Yes ; he said he had no concern in it ; Mr Grimes produc 'd the Will before me , and the Prisoner said he thought it was in the same Manner as it was left , and insisted on his Innocence . There came 2 Neighbours , and told me he was incapable of this thing . I saw the Will , and it appear 'd just as it does now ; I took a great deal of Notice of it , and thought some Part of it to be fresh done , because the Sand appear 'd to me to be still on it . Couns . How did Mr Grimes use the Prisoner ? Mr De Veil . Mr Grimes treated him with deal of good Nature when he was before me . Couns . Did you see the Prisoner Mrs Bates ? Mr De Veil . I think she was before me , and said it was the same , but I ca n't be positive . Mr Needham sworn . Couns . Look on that Paper . Mr Needham . I saw it about 5 or 6 Months ago ; I live opposite to Mr Grimes , and he told me his Uncle was dead , and he was going to Long-Acre to see what was left him . When he came back , he shew 'd me this Paper . Couns . Look on it where those two fives are wrote . Mr Needham . I observ 'd it then , and it appear 'd just as it does now . I did not observe any Sand , but Ink appear 'd to me to be fresher in that Place than in any other . Mr Grimes shew 'd me the Will within an Hour after he came from Bate 's , and after he had been to Mr De Veil . - Curtis sworn . Couns . You were sent for to make a Will for Mr Sandys in the Year 30 ; is this your Writing ? Curtis . Yes Sir . Couns . Did you draw all this Will ? Curtis . Yes ; I engross 'd it . Counsel . Have you ever seen those Figures ? look on them ; 5 l. to John Grimes . Curtis . I believe it was so when the Will was made ; there was a Paper which was wrote by Sandy 's Order found with the Will , wherein all the Legacies were set down . Couns . Did not Mr Grimes come to you about an Erasure ? Curtis . Yes ; I told him I knew nothing at all of it ; it had escap 'd my Memory . I commonly made a Memorandum if any Erasure should happen . They shew 'd me the Will but I could not charge my Memory with it . Couns . On your Oath , did not you say that those two fives were not your Writing . Curtis . I said nothing at all like it , to the best of my Remembrance ; I did not say so . Couns . On your Oath , are they your Writing or not . Curtis . I do believe them to be mine . Couns . How came you to write that Word Five with a small s ? Curtis . I said I could not charge my Memory with it ; I could not be positive in it so long as ten Years . Couns . Are they your Writing or not . Curtis . I do believe them to be mine . Couns . On your Oath , were they wrote on an Erasure ? Curtis . It is an Erasure plain . Couns . How came that Word Five to be in a different Ink ? Curtis . I ca n't tell that ; there was something I believe wrote before the Word Five was there . Couns . Did not you declare , that when an Erasure happened , you always made a Memorandum on the Back ? Curtis . I did not say so , I usually did , I could not say I always did . Prisoner 's Q . Did you mention to Mr Grimes , when he apply 'd to you , that there was another Paper ? Curtis . I did not at that time . After Mr Bates brought me the Paper , I said it was my Writing . The Testator desired me to make a Memorandum of the Legacies . Prisoner 's Q . Was not Mr Grimes at the Expence of a Rule in Easter Term last , to bring you to Westminster ? Curtis . Yes ; I went in a Coach ; the Tipstaff 's Man paid for it . Prisoner 's Q . For what Purpose was it ? Curtis . I ca n't tell what ; to be a Witness on his Behalf I believe , but I told him then that a Paper of all the Legacies was found , and I could not be a Witness for him . Upon that he gave me some opprobrious Words , and I walked back again . I believe it was the Day before Term ended . Prisoner 's Q . Did he say any thing to you about an Indictment ? Curtis . There was a Parchment Writing at that time produc 'd , but he did not tell me what it was . We had a great deal of Talk , and I said there was such a Paper found , it is my Writing by the Testator 's Directions , and it settles in my Mind that you have no more than 5 l. left you . Here is a Man that has a Copy of the Will , I prepar 'd the other from this ; the Alterations here are my Writing ; this was a former Will , dated 1729 . Couns . How came you not to write the 5 l. in this Will , as fair and plain as the other Words ? Curtis . There was a Mistake but how I ca n't tell . Couns . Was that Paper which was found , your Instructions to draw the Will ? Curtis . No ; I wrote it by the Testator 's Desire , that he might know how much the Legacies amounted to . Couns . Did not you copy that Paper from the old Will ? Curtis . No , I took it from the new one . Couns . Your Memory is very good in every thing , but you ca n't tell us , whether there was an Erasure made . Curtis . I ca n't remember , but there must be a Mistake . A Witness . I was present drinking with Curtis , when Mr Grimes came in with the Will . I will tell you how it was . On Easter Monday I was with Curtis ; Mr Grimes and Mr Bambridge came in and wanted to speak with Curtis ; they laid the Will down on the Table , and ask 'd him if he made that Erasure ; they bid him look carefully over it ; and he said he could not remember that he did . The Question was asked him , whether he made that Erasure , and he answer 'd he knew nothing of it ; he could not charge his Memory with it . He said nothing of there being a Paper that would set Things right , but that the Alterations were not his own Writing . This was in the King's-Bench , and I always call 'd to see him when I went that Way . Couns . Did not Curtis say that he could not charge his Memory with Facts ? The Witness . I can say no more than I have told you . Couns . Did not he say that it was a great while ago ? The Witness . Yes , 10 Years ago , and he could not remember so long . I believe Curtis to be an honest Man , and I do not think he would be guilty of Perjury . Mr Bambridge . Mr Grimes came to my Chambers in Easter Holidays , and said there had been an Erasure made in a Will to his Prejudice ; he desired me to go with him to the Man who made the Will ; I went with him , and we found Curtis with two Men ; I called him out , and told him what we came about , but he did not remember any thing . We went in and opened the case before them all , and then he said he did remember the making of the Will ; are the Figures which stand on that Erasement your 's ( said I ) or not ? He said , I think not , and gave us a Reason , that he always made a Memorandum on the Back ; and he made no Hesitation . I can not be so particular , as to remember whether he made use of the Word usually or always . Webb Sworn . Couns . Did you know Mr Sandys in his Life-time ? Webb . Yes . Couns . When was it that you heard him say he had left Mr Grimes any thing . Webb . He dined at Mr. Grimes 's House , and Mr Bates was there at the same time . Couns . Was there any talk about a Will ? Webb . Mr Sandys told my Master , that he had left him 50 l. and it would be the last time he should see him ; he said he left Mr Grimes 's Sister 50 l. There was no mention made of Mr. Grimes 's Mother , what Sum he had left her , only that he had left Mr Grimes and his Sister 50 l. Our Bar-keeper was present , it was the 22d of February . Prisoner 's Q . Do you live with Mr Grimes ? Webb . I have lived with him as a Cellar-Man these four Years ; he deals in Wine by wholesale , in Princes-Street , Drury-Lane . Prisoner . Then you are not his Servant in the Capacity of an Attorney . Mary Smith Sworn . Couns . Do you remember Bates and Sandys at your House . Smith . Yes ; he died the latter end of February , and was at our House the 22d . He had fell down in the Dirt , and my Master asked him if he had hurt himself , and why he would not take a Coach when he came out ; he said if ever he came out again he would have a Coach , but he believed he should never see my Master any more . He said he had left him and his Sister 50 l. Prisoner 's Q . Do you live with Grimes ? Smith . Yes ; I have lived with him as a Bar-keeper about 2 Years ; and Mr Sandys said at our House , that he had left my Master something to remember him . Prisoner 's Q . How came he to say afterwards 50 l. Smith . After Dinner , my Master asked him how he did , he said indifferent , and that he had left him and his Sister 50 l. a piece . The Conversation was almost the same as before Dinner . The Evidence for the Prosecution rested here ; and it was urged on the Part of the Defendants , that what has been offered to support this Indictment could not in the least affect them with respect to the Publication of the Will , knowing it to be forged . Juryman . The Will had been some time out of Mr Bates 's Hands ; a five might have been erased , and another wrote thereon . Acquitted . 501 . + Britannia Wood , otherwise Woolstonecraft , of Christ 's Church Middlesex , was indicted for stealing 3 Pieces of Silk and Cotton , val 2 l. 2 s. the Goods of John Dale , in his Shop . Sept. 30 . John Dale . My Shop is in Skinner-Street . On Monday the 29th of September , I had some pieces of Cotton brought home from the Calender 's , and missed them out of the Shop on the Thursday following . I went out to see after them , but could not find them ; I blamed some People that I have in the House , and making a Noise about them , I was told on the Friday Morning that one of my Pieces were in a Shop in White-Lyon Yard , bought for 8 s . which we never sell for less than 16 , and there I found it . I took up the Prisoner on Suspicion , and charged her with the Fact ; I asked her where the other 2 Pieces were ; at first she denied that she knew any thing of them , and that she bought this Piece which I found , of one Cross ; but at last , she said it I would go out with her , she would tell me where they were , and said that they were pawned at two places . When she was before the Justice , she confessed that she came into my Shop , and asked for some Checque for a Gown , that we could not agree about the Price , and when I turned my Back , she took these 3 Pieces of Cotton off the counter . I found the other two Pieces according to the Prisoner 's Directions , pawned in the Name of Britannia Wood . She said if I would let her go I should have my own again ; I was apprehensive that I had lost a great many more things , so I made her no Promise of Favour . This Letter I received from her while she was in New-Prison ; she told me she sent it . The Letter was read. `` To Mr John Dale , opposite the five Canns `` in Skinner-Street . New-Prison , Octob . 7 , 1740 `` Good SIR , `` I beg Pardon for the crime I have committed `` against you , and the Reproach I have brought `` upon my Family . Good Sir , be favourable to `` me ; consider my unhappy case at present , hoping `` the God of all Mercies will prosper you `` Night and Day , which is the Wish of `` Your afflicted Prisoner , `` Britannia Wood . '' A Woman . The Prisoner brought these three Pieces of Cotton to my House , I asked her the Price of one of them , she said it was 2 s. per Yard ; I took one , and was either to pay for it , or return it on Saturday , but on Friday Mr Dale found it in my House . Mary Turner . She brought one Piece to me , and I lent her 6 s. on it ; I deliver 'd it to the Prose-cutor . Jesse Byrom . The Prisoner brought one Piece to my House , I lent her 6 s. 6 d. on it , and I deliver 'd the same to the Prosecutor . A Witness . I took one Piece from Mrs Turner 's , and one from Mr Byrom 's ; that is all I have to say . Prisoner . I beg the Mercy of the Court ; I have no Friend now , they will be here to-morrow . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 502. Catherine Deleroy , of St. James Clerkenwell , was indicted for stealing 2 Linnen Pillowbiers , 1 pair of Linnen Sheets , a Child 's Shirt , a Child 's Wastcoat , a Piece of Silk , and other Things the Goods of Thomas Trueman , Gent . Sept. 18 . Mr Trueman . The Prisoner was my Servant ; On the 17th of September she went away and took her Things with her . She came again the next Day and ask 'd me for her Wages , and desir 'd my Wife to let her fetch her Bundle down , for when she went away , she said , she had left one behind her ; my Wife said , I do n't know of any Bundle you have here , pray let me see what is in it . We open 'd the Bundle , and found these Things in it , which the Prisoner said were given her by a former Mistress ; but they were my Goods , and had my Mark on them . She brought them out of the Garret , and would have gone off with them if we had not stopp 'd her . They were a piece of Silk , 2 Pillowbiers , a pair of Sheets , and some Childbed Linnen , a Hatband , a Child 's Shirt , a Wastcoat , a Cap , a Forehead Cloth and a Biggin , I know of nothing more . Elizabeth Boyce . I have lived with Mr Trueman a great many Years , and saw the Prisoner take the Goods away , I was above Stairs when she took them , but she did not know that I saw her . I did not say any thing to her 'till she was brought into the Parlour , and the Bundle was open 'd . There were in the Bundle a piece of Silk , 2 Pillow-biers , a Hatband , and several other Things of Mr Trueman 's ; I knew them to be his by the Marks ; some of them were mark 'd with 2 T 's , and some with M and M T. The Prisoner would not confess any thing when we took her , but when she was carry 'd before the Justice , she own 'd she had taken them . Prisoner . Did not I ask my Mistress to look at my Bundle when I brought it down ? Boyce . She went into the Shop , and did not ask her Mistress to look at it before I made the Discovery . She had these things under her Arm , and was carrying them away . Prisoner . When I went up Stairs for my own Bundle , there was this in the Room of it , and when I came to look at it , I found it was not my own ; I wanted to ask my Mistress for my Things , but she hid herself behind the Screen , and would not see me . Boyce . There was no other Bundle put in the Room of her 's . Jury . Why is not the Prisoner 's Mistress here ? Boyce . She is at Market in her Business ; Mr Trueman was bound over to prosecute . Defence . Mary Cuart . The Prisoner lived with me twice ; and behaved as an honest Servant : I have known her 16 Years ; she always had the Character of a sober Girl . I had a Lodger who used frequently to leave his Desk open , and scatter Money out of his Pocket , and she always gave it him again . Peter Brown . I have known her almost from a Child , and always knew her to be a very honest Body ; I was surpriz 'd when I heard that she was taken up for this . William Cash .

Acquitted . 503 . + Mary Harwood , of St Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 3 Thirty-six Shilling Pieces from the Person of Paul Le Cour , Sept. 17 . Paul Le Cour . Between one and two in the Morning , I was coming out of Russel-street , by Drury Lane , and stopp 'd with a Man who sells Salop to drink a Dish ; the Prisoner came up and ask 'd me to treat her ; I did give her a Dish , and after she had drank it , she said she wanted to speak with me ; I was curious to know what she had to say , and went to the corner of the Street with her ; then she ask 'd me to go to Tom King 's , and drink a Glass of Wine , I refus 'd , and while we were talking , she put her Hand into my Breeches Pocket and took out three 36 s. Pieces . I had felt them in my Pocket , not 5 Minutes before I lost them . Prisoner . How is he sure that I took them ? Le Cour . I felt her , and took her Hand in my Pocket . Prisoner . How came he not to prevent me , if he felt my Hand in his Pocket ? Le Cour . She was too quick for me . When I found that my Money was gone , I held her fast against the Wall , and a Fellow she call 'd Husband , came up and insulted me . The Watch was called , and we went to the Watch-house ; when we were there , she said she never saw me ; but I am sure she is the very Woman .

John Loppenburg , of Paddington , was indicted for that he , after the 24th Day of June , 1731 , viz . on the 26th of April , 150 lb . of Lead , val . 15 s. the Goods of James Frapwell , fixed to a certain Messuage , he did rip , steal , and carry away . The Prisoner , being a Foreigner , demanded a Party Jury , and the following Persons were sworn . English Samuel Adderson , Robert Tonstal , Richard Spire , Thomas Wilkin , Benjamin Eager , John Brice . Foreign Charles Delahaye , John Payne , Robert Wanmer , James Grelliere , Peter Lemaistre , Francis Roasiere . Walter Dobener . On the 26th of April , I was informed that a Leaden Gutter , and several Pipes , were stolen from Mr Frapwell 's House . I thought fit to get a Warrant to search proper Places , and just as we were got to Marybon Turnpike , a shower of Rain came upon us , and we stood up in the Turnpike House . While we were there the People were talking , that a Man was taken in a Brick-Field with Leaden Pipe upon him , and that he was carried to the Bell at Paddington . We went to the Bell , and found the Prisoner with some People , who had secured him , in a little Room in the House , and a Bag of Lead on the Table . I took Dimensions of the Lead , and went to the House from whence it was taken , and it fitted exactly . I then charged a Constable with the Prisoner , and carried him before a Justice , where he said , that he found it in a Pond . When he was taken he was asked where he found the Bag , and he said in the other Field , behind the Bush ; and that there was a Lock of Straw on it . I was not at the first taking of the Prisoner ; I was going to the Gravel-Pits , but hearing at the Turnpike that a Man was taken with Lead , I turned back again . When I charged him with stealing it , he behaved very cooly , and said , that he found it in a Pond , and the Bag behind the Bush . There was a wet Shirt in the Bag beside the Lead , and before the Justice he said , that he went to the Pond to wash his Shirt , and then found the Lead . There was about a Quarter of a hundred in the Bag , and the wet Shirt . The Shirt was produced before the Justice , and was very dirty . John Gays . On the 26th of April , I was informed that some Lead was found in Spruce and Baker 's Pond at Paddington . I went with them to see it , and a Storm of Hail occasioned us to go to a Hedge 40 Yards from the Pond for Shelter . In the Interim the Prisoner came into the Field , and went towards Bay's-Water , I did not suspect him by his Dress ; he came between us and the Pond , and I took particular Notice to see if he looked towards the Pond , but could not perceive that he did . We set a Man to watch , imagining that the Lead would be fetched out of the Pond in small Quantities . I put the Lead , which had been taken out of the Pond , in again , after the Prisoner was gone out of the Field towards Bay's-Water . I then went away , and sent a Man to watch ; he came running back to me , and said , he saw a Man come to the Pond with something in a Bag ; I went after the Prisoner , and when I came near him , I saw that he had a Bag in his Hand ; he went over a Ditch into another Field , put the Bag into the Ditch , and then retreated from it 3 or 4 Yards . I ran up to him , imagining it to be the Lead , and asked him how he came by it ; he said , he found it in the Pond . We then carried him to Paddington , and he answered all the Questions that were put to him , in English , very distinctly ; he had the same Coat on then as now , his Shirt was not so clean , and he looked a little rough . There was a Shirt found by the Bag , and he said he went to the Pond to wash it ; but there were many other Places more private where he might have done it . Richard Hammond . I am Mr Frampton 's Gardiner , and lie in the House . On the 26th of April last , I heard a Noise between 1 and 2 o'clock in the Morning ; I got up and looked out at the Window , and saw a Ladder against the House . I did not go to Bed again , but looked about the House , and found that a great deal of Lead had been taken from the West End ; there were leaden Pipes , and part of the Gutter gone . The Lead was pretty substantial , and required some Work to take it down , and the Noise waked me , but I heard no Voices . The Ladder belonged to a Carpenter at Kensington , and he lent it to a Bricklayer . John Green . On the 26th of April , between 8 and 9 in the Morning , I was sent for to watch at the Pond , and while I was there , I saw the Prisoner go from the Pond with the Lead in a Bag ; he did not take the Foot-path , but crossed the Road , and seemed to run with it . I then called Gays , and he ran after the Prisoner and overtook him , and when I came up he had hold of him ; the Bag and a dirty Shirt lay by him ; I asked him what he designed to do with the Lead , he said it was to make Shot , to go a shooting with , and that he was going to wash his Shirt , and found the Lead in the Pond . Defence . I went out that Morning in order to wash a coarse dirty Shirt ; I was ashamed to be seen doing it by any body , because it was torn and ragged . I went to one Pond , and saw People there , so I went to another , and as I was washing it , I saw Lead in the Pond . I hung my Shirt up to dry , and walked to and fro while it was drying , and saw two Men walking about ; I threw the Shirt from me least they should laugh at me , and imagining they would come and find the Lead , I thought I might take some of it too to make Shot , and finding the Bag , I took a little out and put it into the Bag . Erasmus Preia . The Prisoner came into England with Esquire Burrard , who had serv 'd as a Voluntier in the Russian Army , against the Turks . When the Prisoner first lodged with me , I liv 'd in King-Street , St. James 's , but now I live in Leicester-fields . On the 25th of April , the Prisoner went to Bed at a little after 10 , and I lock 'd up the Doors and took the Key with me . I deliver 'd the Key to my Maid a little after 6 , that my Lodgers might go out to Work , and I did not see the Prisoner afterwards . I take him to be very honest ; he always kept the best Company ; but never gam 'd at Cards , or any thing like it . He had washed his Linnen often himself , and used to wash his Master 's , when in the Russian Camp . John Christopher Mendel . I know the Prisoner ; ed with him in that Gentleman 's House all the Winter . On the 25th of April he lay with me all Night . I awak 'd several Times in the Night and found him abed , and we 'rose together at half an Hour after 5 in the Morning , but I went out and left him at Home . I do n't know any thing about his going out that Morning in particular , but I know he frequently used to go into the Fields to wash his Shirts , because he did not care that any Body should see them . Jury to Prtia . How far is it from your House to Paddington . Prtia . About half a Mile . Mendel . He never lay out all Night , but behaved very civilly , and frequented no bad company . Mr. Burrard . I have known the Prisoner since last June was Twelve-months , I had leave from his Majesty to make a Campaign under Count Munich , in 1738 , and he came from abroad with me . He lived in my House , and behaved himself as a diligent Servant , and I always thought him as honest a Fellow as ever I knew in my Life . My Brother gave me a Character of him , and he had 'trusted him by himself through Poland with his Baggage , where he did not meet with a House , or an Inhabitant for 100 miles . I really believe the man to be as innoceent of this as myself . He propos 'd to go into the India Service , if this had not happened . Mr Bromfield . I have known the Prisoner about 12 months ; I have been frequently in this Gentleman 's House , and never heard a better Character of any one in my Life . Mr Burrard again . When he has been with me , he has not had his Cloaths off for 3 Weeks together , and if he had had a mind to have wrong 'd me and gone off , I could not have enquired after him , because I could not speak the Language of the Country . He has had frequent Opportunities in my House , to wrong me , if he had been so inclined . He has the best of Characters , I never saw him drunk in my Life . Earnest Cibber . I knew him at Petersburgh , in Muscovy , he lived with an Ambassador at that Place . I am a Goldsmith , and have entrusted him , and he always behaved very honestly . I took him to be a very sober man . Christian Lisener . I have known him about a Year , he always behaved well , and I never heard any Harm of him in my Life . I have been at his Master 's House , and was always desirous of his Company . Acquitted . * * This Trial came on in a former Sessions , but was then omitted merely for want of Room .
