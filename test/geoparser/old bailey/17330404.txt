William Higgs . The Prisoner , Jo . Phips , is my Apprentice , and the other Prisoner , Jenny Tinsley , was my Journeywoman . He was a good Servant till she spoil 'd him . I am a Turner by Trade , but my chief Business is to make Babies , and when they are made my Wife dresses them , my Boy and my Journeywoman follow 'd the same sort of Work ; she lodg 'd with one Margaret Davis , and was very intimate with one Johanna Morgan . My Wife going to Davis 's House , found one of my Matted Chairs there ; Davis said , she bought it of my Apprentice for 10 d. tho ' it stood me in 14 d. I tax 'd him with it , and he own 'd he sold it to her , that Tinsley took the Money , gave him 6 d. of it , and had the remaining Groat for her self ; and she own 'd that she took the Money and carried it to him . Upon this I got a search Warrant , and found 14 of my naked Babies in Tinsley 's Room , in Davis 's House . I know my own Babies from any other Man 's , I can swear to my own Work , for there 's never a Man in England that makes such Babies besides my self . Then I went to Johanna Morgan 's in the Minories , and there I found 2 Dozen more of Babies ready dress 'd , in a Basket , and these were my own work too . Judith Higgs . I miss 'd my Journeywoman , and going to see for her at her Landlady 's , there I found one of our new Matted Chairs . Tinsley own 'd she receiv 'd 10 d. for it , and said , that she gave the Money to my Apprentice . He said , he had but 6 d. of the Money , and that she had the remaining Groat . Tinsley confess 'd that he gave her the Babies , and the Silk they were dress 'd with , to carry to Morgan 's . Margaret Davis . I bespoke a Chair of Phips . He brought me one , and said the Price was 10 d. and so much I gave for it . Tinsley and Eleanor Maclande brought some Babies to my House to dress . Tinsley . Did not Maclander bring them ? Davis . They both brought Babies , and when they had dress 'd them , they carry 'd them away . I thought they had carry 'd them to their Master 's . Court . Is it not usual for Workwomen to carry the Babies home to dress ? Judith Higgs . No , my Husband makes them , and I and my Women dress them at my House , and I have often charged them never to carry the Babies home . Tinsley . My Mistress having given me Warning , I bought some Silk and Tinsel to dress Babies on my own Account . I had as much Silk of a Rag-woman for 6 d. as would cloath a Dozen Babies . As for the Babies that were found at my Lodging , Maclander brought them thither ; and as for the Chair , Phips brought it to my Landlady 's , and she gave me 10 d. to carry to him for it , and I gave it him all , for the Groat that I had was my own Money . John Wood , Constable . I took Tinsley out of her Bed , and she confess 'd that she had a Groat out of the 10 d. that the Chair was sold for . Peirce Newton . Tinsley has dress 'd Babies for me , and about a Year ago , she went from me to work for the Prosecutor , and whatever he may say , my House is Superior to his for Babies , and if she was now deliver 'd of his Babies I would make no Scruple to trust her with any of mine . Johanna Morgan . I have known Jenny Tinsley these 5 Years , and a very honest Body she is . For my own part , I never dress 'd a Baby in my life ; but on the 21st of March about Noon , Nell , what d 'ye call her ? a crooked Body , brought two dozen of these Dolls to my House Jenny came with her indeed , but it was Nell that had the Dolls . And so , says Nell , says she , I wish you would go and sell these Dolls for me to such a Man , in St. Catherine's-Lane , that has bespoke 'em I am afraid Nell , says I , that these Dolls belong to your Master [ the Prosecutor . ] No , says Nell , they are nothing but old rubbishing Dolls that lie about our House , and such as we often fling away , and I have got our Joe to paint their Faces up , and make them look a little smug ; so away goes I to this Man 's House , but when I came there he was provided , for he had just bought half a Gross of Dolls for 15 s. back I comes to Nell , and tells her how , and about it . Well , says she , go to Mr. Robottom 's in White-Chapel , and see if he wo n't buy them . No , says I , Nell , any Body may see by my Looks , that I am no Doll-dresser . So then Nell was for going away , and Jenny said to her ( but I do n't know what she meant by it ) I wish you would dress those two odd Dolls for me . When Nell was gone , I advised Jenny to go to her Master 's , for fear she should lose her Work ; but it raining very hard , she could not go without being wet to the Skin , and so she staid till 9 at Night , and then went home . About half an Hour after comes Nell again , and asks for Jenny . I told her she was gone , and with that Nell turns about , and beckons thus with her Finger - I ask your Lordship 's Pardon - and in comes Mr. Higgs and his Wife . Says he , What 's in that Basket ? A Parcel of Dolls , says I . Give them me , says he , No , says I , you may take them if you will . So his Wife took the Basket , and turn 'd the Dolls out upon my Bed and told them , and then she put them up again . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 5.

Thomas Russell . The Prosecutor came to me in Drury-Lane Playhouse-Passage , and asked for a Constable . I went with him to the House , where we found only the Prisoner . I ask 'd him , if it was she that took his Watch , he said , No , the Women that took it were gone . I told the Prisoner if she 'd procure the Watch I 'd give her half a Guinea . Give it me then , says she , and I 'll find the Watch . Will you so ? Says I , then if you can find it for half a Guinea you shall find it without . But she would not , and so she was sent to Bridewell , and while she was there , the Watch was sent to the Keeper . Prisoner . I was a poor desolate Girl , and had been but a Week in the House , but I thought it was better to be in any Business than to live idle . The Prosecutor came home with my Mistress , and they and another Woman had two Quarterns of Brandy , for which he paid me a Shilling , and then bid me go out , which I did , and in about an Hour he and the Women went out together , and afterwards he came again with a Constable , and said , he had lost his Watch , and offer 'd me half a Guinea to help him to it again ; but because I could not , he had me before Justice De Veil , and so I was sent to Bridewell . The Jury acquitted her . 9. Robert Lloyd was indicted for breaking and entring the House of John Big , Esq ; and stealing three pair of Curtains , a Cloak , a Gown , and a Key , March 23 . about four o'Clock in the Night of the same Day . John Wallington and his Wife were left in the House , in Denmark Street , to take care of it till it was Let . About 4 in the Morning the Watchman seeing a Light in the fore Parlour , had some suspicion of Thieves , and knocking at the Door alarmed Wallington , who got up , and upon search they found the Drawers open , the Goods laid on the Floor ready to pack up , and the Prisoner hid under the Kitchen Stairs , with a Candle newly extinguish 'd , the Key of the Street Door , and Seven picklock Keys in his Pocket . The Prisoner in his Defence , said , that he pick 'd up a Whore , who carry 'd him into this House ; that he lay with her on the Stairs , and afterwards fell asleep , so that he could not tell what became of her .

William Raven was indicted for stealing an Iron Rail , value 2 s. the Property of Arabella Scattergood , March 22 . William James . This Bar fell in the Airey , and alarmed me and the Watch . James Fenning . I am Watchman in Cavendish Square . As I was standing in my Watch-box between 2 and 3 in the Morning , I heard the fall of an Iron Rail , and running out I saw the Prisoner coming from the Steps at Madam Scattergood 's Door with a Bar in his Hand . As soon as he perceiv 'd me , he took to his Heels , and I ran after him . He threw away the Bar , and ran by the Duke of Argyle 's down King-street ; I cry 'd out , stop Thief , he got past the first Watch , but was stopt by another Watch , and he was not out of my Sight till he was taken . The Moon was up , but it was a little cloudy , though not so much but I could see him . Jonathan Dickenson , Watchman . As I called Two o'Clock in Marlborough-street , I found a Bar of some Pallisades bent , and looking farther I found another in the same Condition . Upon this I thought there was some Roguery going forward ; so I planted my Lanthern in the middle of Blenheim-street , that my Inhabitants might see I was upon my Duty , and then I went aside and stood upon the Watch , and presently I heard a cry of stop Thief . Says I to my Brother Watch , do you go down Tyler-street , and I 'll go down Little Marlborough-street , and so we did . I met the Prisoner running with his drawn Sword ( for he is a Soldier ) and I knocked him down . My Liberty has lately been very much robbed , which is a sign that it is pestered with Rogues ; I have lost a great deal of ron and Lead - not that it was my own , but my inhabitants ; and as several Attempts have been made , they had lost a great deal more if it had not been for the Care of the Watch , which is a Sign that the Watch have not neglected their Duty ; and if the Watch should sink , by consequence my Inhabitants can not stand . And therefore , pray , my Lord , stand by the Watch whatever you do , or else my People will be undone ; they will be robbed , and have their Throats cut , and their Houses burnt about their Ears . The Prisoner has threatened to be even with the Watch , but he did not say which of them ; therefore , I hope , the Watch will be protected . When I knocked the Prisoner down , he reeled six Yards before he sell , and then he said I had killed him . Luke - Watchman . I heard a cry of stop Thief , and met the Prisoner running with his drawn Sword ; I made a blow at him , but he put it by with his Sword ; I called out to Jonathan Dickenson , who knocked him down . The Prisoner was upon Guard , and had his Accoutrements on . I found this Chissel in his Cartridge Box . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 15.

John Harrison . I had been drinking too much in the City , and in my Way Home I parted with a Friend who call 'd me by my Name , and bad me good night . The Prisoner Leakin coming by , and hearing my Name , she call 'd to me , and said , Wo n't you give me a Dram , Master Harrison ? Who are you , says I ? What ! says she , do n't you know me , Master ? I am Leakin the Waterman 's Wife . So I went with her to Mrs. Robinson 's Brandy-shop in Nightingale-lane , and there was a Boy playing on the Bell-harp ; I threw down a Half-penny ( as I thought ) to the Boy ; but the Woman of the Shop took it up , and said it was a Guinea . I told her , since she was so honest , if she would give me 20 Shillings in Change , I would leave the other Shilling to be spent among the Customers . So she gave me 20 s. and presently Michael Roop ( Frances Roop 's Husband ) came in . He was a Waterman , and I had some Acquaintance with him . Lord ! Mr. Harrison , says he , how came you here ? Let me see you Home ; but I hope we shall drink together first ; wo n't you give me a Pint . Master ? With all my Heart , says I , and so he and I and his Wife and Betty Leakin went to the Horse-shoe and Ship Alehouse , where I gave them three Pints of Two penny , and a Pint of hot ; I paid a Shilling for the Reckoning , and then he talked no more about seeing me home . Then I went out and said I would go home , but his Wife and Leakin said No , you shall go and lye at our House . So I went with them to an empty House in Black-Jack Alley , and there they set me on the Floor , and I fell fast asleep , and lost the Goods and Money mentioned in the Indictment , but I do n't know who took them from me . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . 21.

They were a 2d time indicted , for assaulting Eleanor Stevens , Spinster , on the Highway , putting her in Fear , and taking from her 20 s. on the 20th of January last . Dr. Stevens . I live in Covent Garden . On St. Paul 's Day in the Evening , I went with my Daughter to visit a Friend in Silver-street . About Eleven I sent for a Hackney Coach , for as I expected to stay late I had discharged my own Chariot ; the Coach waited at the Door about an hour and a half , and then I and my Daughter stept in . I suppose some Street Robbers had taken Notice of the Coach 's standing there so long ; for at the End of Foster-lane my Daughter told me there was a Couple of Men that follow 'd us . The Coach going faster in Cheapside , she observ 'd that they mended their Pace accordingly ; Pappa ! says she , how those Gentlemen run ! She took them to be Gentlemen , for they were well dress 'd . We went down Pater-noster-Row , and in Ave-Mary-Lane , the Coach was stopp 'd . A Man came to the Coach-door , and holding a Pistol to my Daughter 's Head , he said , Do n't be frighten 'd Madam ! but God damn you if you squawl , I 'll shoot you thro ' the Head ! I had a Purse with 10 Guineas in it , which I secur 'd , and gave him only a half Guinea , and a Spanish Dollar , which were loose in my Pocket . God damn you , says he , you have more ! No I ha'nt , says I , you shall search me if you will . My Daughter gave him her Purse ; he ask 'd her what was in it ? She said , Not above 3 or 4 Guineas . And then he bid the Coachman drive on . Court . Do you know the Person that robb 'd you and your Daughter ? Dr. Stevens . Yes , I am pretty sure it was that young Fellow there , he in the Blue-grey Coat , Edward Powers . As soon as he was gone , says I to my Daughter , you told me there were two Men , but I saw but one ? Pappa , says she , there was another , but he stood at a Distance . The Coachman likewise said there were two , but neither my Daughter nor he saw any more ; and therefore I ca n't apprehend that Powers and the 3 Prisoners could all be there . Miss Stevens . My Father and I were robb 'd by one Man . I gave my Purse to that Man . I ca n't say how much Money there was in it , any farther , than that there was above ten Shillings . I know none of the Prisoners , nor who it was that took my Money . The Account my Father has given is true , and I can add nothing more to it . Edward Powers . The Prisoner Elms and I went to Will . Morris 's Mother 's ( in Eagle-Court in the Strand ) to sell some things that we had stole ; we staid there till 9 at Night , and then I ask 'd Will Morris to go out with me ; but he not being well , refus 'd ; then Elms and I agreed to go together ; he had two Pistols , and I had one , and a great Knife . We went down Holbourn , and so to Cheapside , where we met the other two Prisoners , Kemp and Taylor . They ask 'd us to give them a Dram , for they said , they had been picking of Pockets all Night , and had got nothing but two Handkerchiefs , but they must get something else or it would never do . We went to a Gin-Shop over-against Stocks-Market , where we had half a Pint of Gin , and we agreed to go out together , and get some Money . Court . Was that Agreement made in the Shop ? Powers . No , it was as we were coming out . Court . What Time was this ? Powers . It was between 9 and 10 at Night . I do n't remember the Day of the Month ; but I think it was on a Friday . We went as far as Fleet-Street , and return 'd thro ' St. Paul 's Church-Yard , and so to Cheapside again , before we met with any thing ; but then we saw this Coach and agreed to rob it . It was then between 12 and 1 a-Clock . We all follow 'd it to Cheapside-Conduit , and there we agreed that Elms and I should still follow the Coach , which went down Pater-noster-Row , and that Kemp and Taylor should go thro ' Paul 's Church-Yard , and meet us . We did so , and met in the Street that is over-against Warwick-Lane , and turns out of Pater-noster-Row into Ludgate-Street ; I forgot the Name of the Place , and there we stopt the Coach . Court . Were you all four together then ? Powers . Yes , but not very close . We were in Sight of one another . Court . Are you sure that Kemp and Taylor agreed with you to rob this Coach ? Powers . Yes , we agreed so to do as soon as we saw it , and they two agreed to go thro ' Paul 's Church-Yard for the same Purpose . Court . And how did you dispose of your selves when you met ? Powers . Elms bid the Coachman stand . Says I to Taylor , the Watch is hard by . But says he , they do n't see us ; but for fear they should disturb us , it was agreed that he should stand and keep an Eye upon them . Then I went to the Coach-door , and desir 'd the Doctor to deliver . The Doctor gave me a Dollar , and something else , but I do n't know whether it was a half Guinea or a 6 Pence , for I dropp 'd it out of my Hand . Then Kemp came and robb 'd the Doctor 's Daughter . Court . Are you sure that kemp robb 'd the young Lady ? Powers . Yes , I am positive of it . I sold the Dollar for 4 s. 4 d. to a Silversmith in the Hay-Market in the Borough ; 't is on this Side the King's-Bench , and almost over-against Blue-Maid-Alley . Court . Is that Silversmith here ? Powers . No . Court . And whither did you go after the Robbery ? Powers . We went to Smithfield , and there we shared the Money in the Street . There was 11 s. 6 d. in the Purse . I had the Dollar for my Share , which they reckon 'd at a Crown , and said , it was more than my Due . Then I cross 'd the Water , and they went over the Bridge , in Expectation of meeting their Wives who walk 'd the Streets . Elms . Where was I ever drinking in your Company , or in any Robbery with you ? Powers , I have known Elms three Years . He never robb 'd in my Company before , except only trifling Things , as when we took some Goods out of a Sash Window in Chancery-Lane . I was with him in the Poultry-Compter , where he robb 'd two Taylors , and it cost me six Guineas to have the Bill brought in Ignoramus . And we have been in Newgate together too . Court . Call the Turnkey ; swear him ; Have you seen Elms before ? Turnkey . Yes , my Lord ; he and Powers were both Prisoners together , in the Common Side in Newgate . Elms . I was sent to the Compter only for an Assault . Kemp , to Powers . When we were in the Brandy Shop [ at Stocks market ] was any Body else with us ? Powers . No . Kemp . Was I ever with you since you have been an Evidence ? Powers . No , I have been in Jail ever since . Kemp . I mean , before you was an Evidence . Powers . Yes , when my Lady Page dy 'd , he carry 'd me down to Greenwich to cut Pockets at the Burying , and we follow 'd her to Bunhill-Fields . Taylor . Was I ever drinking with you ? Powers . Yes often , but we never were in any Robberies together , except in picking of Pockets , of Handkerchiefs and such Trifles . Kemp . Powers took me in Bird-Cage-Alley in the Mint , ( on the 15th of February ) to bring me on this Side of the Water . I resisted , and desired to go before a Justice , and so I was carried before Sir John Lade , and there this Cabbage * as they call him ) swore that we broke open a House against the School in Chancery-Lane , and Stole some Books , and that we robb 'd a Coach in Ave-Mary-Lane , of 11 s. 6 d. and a Silver Dollar . * A cant Name that Powers goes by . Court . He swears the same now ; have you any Witnesses ? Kemp . I know no Body here , and therefore it 's in vain for me to call for any . Taylor . I have been at work above this 12 Month with this Gentleman here , and never was out of the House at unseasonable Hours . John Tomlinson . I have known Taylor from a Child . He 's a Taylor by Trade , and has work 'd for me within these six Months . I think he 's as sober a Man as any upon Earth . I never heard any Ill of him before , and would trust him again . Martha Claridge . Taylor lives with his Mother . I lodge in the same House ; he was always at home by 8 or 9 at Night , I never knew him given to drinking , or that he kept ill Company . John Miller . Taylor was my Journeyman three Years ago . I have trusted him with my House and Shop , and never heard any Ill of him before . Officer . My Lord , here 's the Coachman . Court . Let him be sworn . Do you know Powers ? Charles Headly , Coachman . Not by Name ; but if this is he , I have seen him before ; he robb 'd my Coach . I took up Dr. Stevens and his Daughter in Silver-Street . He bid me drive to King's-Street in Covent-Garden . That Day was three Weeks , about 3 in the Morning , I had taken up a Fare , to carry to the Sun in Clare-Market , and going behind Paul 's my Fare was robb 'd . And therefore not thinking it safe to go that way again , I drove down Pater-noster-Row . I was got but a little way down , when I saw two Men by my Coach side , one kept even with my Fore-Wheel , and the other with the Hind-Wheel . If I trotted , they mended their pace . There was no Watchmen on that side of the Way , but there were some on the other . I having been robb 'd so lately , I had a Suspicion of them , and taking fast hold by my Seat . I stoop 'd down and look 'd hard at them betwixt the Wheel . I saw they were well dress 'd , and Zookers , thinks I , why should I have an ill Opinion of these Persons , they look like Gentlemen ? So I drove on ; but in Ave-Mary-Lane , before I came to Stationery-Court , one of them catch 'd hold of my Horse 's Head , and the other went rou nd to the Coach Door , and open 'd it , on that Side next to the Watch , which I thought was a little bold , for the Watch stood but at the Corner of Pater-noster-Row . When he had robb 'd my Fare , they did not run away , but stood still , and bid me drive on , which I did . I look 'd back three or four Times , and saw them both walk leisurely off together . Court . Both ? Did you see but two ? Headly . I saw no more . Court . Did they both go to the Coach-door ? Headly . No ; but one of them , and that was Powers . Court . Are you very sure of that ? Headly . Yes , I am certain of it ; for the other all the while walked to and fro by the Horses Heads , and cried , Hoy ! - Have a Care ! - What 's the Matter ? - Stand away ! - to make believe that the Coach stood still to set down a Fare . Court . Look at the Prisoners - go nearer - Did you see either of them there ? Headly . I think that Man [ Elms ] is very like him that stopt the Horses , but I ca n't be positive ; I would not swear away any Man 's Life for the World . Court . Mr. Stevens , I think , Sir , you said , that the same Person who robbed you , robbed your Daughter ; are you positive as to that Particular ? Dr. S. I am positive it was the very same Person . Court And are you , Madam ? Miss S. Yes , my Lord . Court . And neither of you saw any more than two Men . Both . No more . Court . The Coachmen swears the same ; and yet Powers has sworn , that there were four concern 'd in the Robbery , and that self robb 'd the Doctor , and Kemp the young Lady : This considerably lessens the Credit of Power 's Evidence . Joseph Tanfield . Elms was my Neighbour above a Year ; he was a very civil Man ; he 's a Cutter of Gloves , by Trade , and follow 'd that Business . Court . Did you never hear that he was a common Thief ? Tanfield . No , never before this John Dobson . Elms lodged in my House ten Months , I never heard any Harm of him before ; he went out early to Work , and came early Home . Court . Did you never hear that he was in Newgate ? Dobson . No , never . Mary Tanfield , Sarah Dobson , Jane Jenkinson , and Margaret Crabtree , depos 'd to the same Effect . The Jury , after near two Hours Consideration , acquitted Kemp and Taylor , and found Elms guilty of both Indictments . Death . 53. William Gordon of St. Margaret 's , Westminster , was indicted for assaulting Francis Peters , Gent . on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat with a Crape Hatband , value 5s . a Wig , value 40s . a Silver Watch , value 4l . a Gold Ring , value 15s . and 12s . in Money , Feb. 26 . At the Prisoner 's Prayer the Witnesses were examin 'd a-part . Mr. Peters . On the 26th of February , near 8 at Night , I and my Daughter were returning from Kensington in a Hackney Coach ; the wooden Shutters of the Coach-doors were drawn up close ; a little on this side of Knights-bridge , some body tap 'd at one of the wooden Shutters , and my Daughter let it down , when presently a Man on Horseback put something into the Coach ( I suppose it was a Pistol ) and said , Deliver your Money ! I took out some Money , I guess it might be about 12s . and gave him . He then said , Give me your Hand , which I did ; and he pulled off my Ring . It was a mourning Ring , I had it made with several others of the same kind , on the Death of my Uncle ; the Inscription was , Dan . Brown 22 May , 1732 . AEt . 80 . He asked for my Sword ; I told him I had none ; Then give me your Watch , says he . I pulled my Watch out , and in pulling , the Chain slip 'd off . I gave the Chain to my Daughter , and the Watch to the Prisoner . Whether it was after I had given him my Watch , or before , I can not be certain , but he snatch 'd off my Hat and Wig . I expostulated with him on that Occasion . I told him it was very unusual for Men of his Profession to take such Things , and that it being very cold it might indanger my Health . He swore plentifully , gave me a great deal of opprobrious Language , and told me that he would take all he could get . While we were in this Debate , a Man came from the Causeway with a Candle and Lanthorn , upon which the Highwayman rode off . The Man with the Lanthorn follow 'd , and alarm 'd the Neighbourhood , and my Servant ( Tho Watts ) who was behind the Coach , got down and went after them , but return 'd before the Prisoner was apprehended . I ty 'd a Handkerchief about my Head , and the Coachman drove on . Next Morning , being Tuesday , I sent for Mr. Delander , who made my Watch , to have it advertis 'd . He went home to look for the Number , and brought me word , that the Prisoner was taken at Knightsbridge . I have a Friend there ( Major Aldy ) who is a Justice of the Peace . I sent my Man that way , to enquire if any of my Goods were found upon the Prisoner ; my Man went to the Major , who sent me word of the Particulars , and that he could not detain the Prisoner without my Evidence . I took Horse , and went thither that Afternoon . Mr. Aldy shew 'd me these Goods . This is the Watch , I have Reason to know it , for I have had it these 20 Years . The Swivel is broken off , and here 's my Name F.P . In a Cypher engraven on the Back of the Case . This is the Wig , 't is seal 'd with black Wax ( 't is my Daughter 's Seal , with my Coat of Arms in a Lozenge , ) this , with as much Certainty as is possible , I believe to be mine ; and this is the Ring which I verily believe is mine too . Here 's the Inscription on it , which I mentioned before , tho ' indeed I gave away several of the same Sort upon my Uncle 's Death ; but they were all made fit for the Persons they were design 'd for , and this fits me exactly . Mr. Aldy told me , the Prisoner was in the Round-house , and ask 'd me if I would have him sent for , but I chose to go to him . There 's an Inner-Room in the Round-house , in which the Prisoner was lock 'd up . I told him , he had used me hardly , in taking my Hat and Wig . He said , he had no Remembrance of it , but he was sorry - Court . What did he say he was sorry for ? Mr. Peters . He did not say for what , but only that he was sorry . I told him I did not expect him to make a Confession to me . As near as I can guess , he at that time had on the same kind of Habit as the Person had who robbed me . And I thought him much of the same Bulk and Size , being a very lusty tall Man , though I am the less certain as to that , because he that robbed me was on Horse-back , and I could not so well determine as to his Height . And as it was near Eight at Night , it was too dark for me to distinguish his Person , or the Colour of his Clothes , though when the Lanthorn came , the glimpse of the Candle gave a better Observation , but not enough to enable me to be positive . Prisoner . When the Gentleman came to me in the Roundhouse , he said that I was the Man ; upon which I told him , if I was , I was sorry for it . Court . The Gentleman speaks very fair , he does not swear that you said you was sorry you had robbed him , but only that you was sorry . Thomas Watts . I was behind the Coach when my Master was robbed ; it was about Eight o'Clock on Monday Night , betwixt Knightsbridge and the Park-Gate . I believe the Prisoner to be the Man ; I could distinguish his Person by the light of the Lanthorn ; he had a whitish great Coat on ; he bid the Coachman stand , and then went to the Window and bid them open it . Then he said , Give me your Money ; which I suppose was done , because I heard him say , Is this all ? Then he said , Give me your Sword . My Mistress answered , My Father has none . And then he asked for my Master 's Watch and Ring , and I believe they were delivered to him , but I do not know for certain . And about that time I saw him make a Motion with his Hand in the Coach , and he brought out my Master 's Hat and Wig . A Man coming along with a Lanthorn , I beckoned and spoke to him softly . He came towards me , and I jumped down , and told him , that a Highwayman was robbing my Master ; the Light coming up , the Prisoner turn 'd his Horse and rode towards Knights-bridge . That 's the Man , says I ; and so I and the other Man follow 'd , and alarm 'd the People ; but the Prisoner was not then taken . So I came back , and found my Master with a Handkerchief on his Head . Next Morning my Master sent me to Newgate , to see if any such Person was come in . I heard of none there , and then I went to the Gatehouse , and there was none there neither ; but going towards Kensington , I called at the Sun Alehouse , where I heard that such a Man was taken , and coming back I saw the Prisoner going from the Roundhouse to the Justice 's . The Justice gave me a Note to my Master to desire him to come and see the Prisoner in the Afternoon , and my Master went . Henry Spencely . As I was coming home from London with my Lanthorn , I saw a Coach standing in the Road , and the Footman behind beckoned to me . I went towards him , and said , What do you want honest Friend ? He made me no Answer just then , but presently such a Man as the Prisoner is for bulk brushed by me . He was in a white Rug Coat , he had something in his Hand , which I guess was a Pistol ; I struck at him , and cry 'd out , Stop Highwayman . The Town was alarmed , but no Body stopt him . Court . How so ? Spencely . Because I suppose they did not dare to do it . I followed him , and Mr. Peters 's Man came after me , expecting the Highwayman had been taken ; but finding that he was not , he return 'd to his Master , I continued my Pursuit till I came to the Halfway-House betwixt Kensington and Knights-bridge , and looking through the Window I saw the Prisoner sitting on Horseback in the Kitchen . Court . On Horseback in the Kitchen ? Was the Door high enough for him to ride in ? Spencely . Yes ; I saw he was such a Man as I had seen at the Coach-side about a Quarter of an Hour before ; that was at about Eight a Clock , and this was at about a Quarter past Eight . I would have gone in and taken him directly , but 2 Women ( who were with me , and saw him sitting upon the House - the Horse , I would say - as well as I ) would not let me . Says I , There 's a Highwayman , by God . - I beg your Lordship 's Pardon - and I 'll go and pull him off his Horse ; ( for I was Man sufficient to do it without any Assistance ) but as I said , the 2 Women would not let me . They begged me not to venture ; for said they , If you should be murder 'd , we sha n't bear to see your Wife . Though I had certainly done it nevertheless , if he had been alone ; but besides the Prisoner , I saw the Landlord there , and a Woman , and a Soldier , and the House was a House of ill Repute . So I proceeded to get more help , and met the Kensington Stage-Coach with some Men in it , and desired them to assist , but they refused . Then I went to Mr. Swinnow 's , where the two young Women ( who went forward while I stopt to speak with the Kensington Coach ) were got before me . There I found Henry Cornish , and he agreed to go with me . We went back to the Half-way-House , but the Prisoner was not then in the Kitchen . Mr. Peters . When you saw the Prisoner thro ' the Window , had he one or two Hats on ? Spencely . I ca n't say as to that ; but not seeing him in the Kitchin when I came back , I asked the Landlord if such a Man had not been there . He did not answer me readily , which made me suspect the Prisoner was concealed in the House ; but at last he said , such a Man had been there , but he was gone . I told him that Gentleman was my Friend , and I should be glad to drink with him . My Landlord made me no answer , and I finding that the Pretence I made would signify nothing , I told him that that Man was a Highwayman , that I had seen him thro ' the Window but a little while ago , and that I had been to get Assistance to take him . Presently a Man came to the Door , and cry 'd Hollo ! some Body said , That 's he . I was just going to step out , but my Landlord pushed out before me , and seized him first ; I followed directly , and others after me , and then my Landlord pulled him off the Horse . Court . Did he make any Resistance ? Spencely . After we had seized him , he dragged us , I believe , a matter , of 18 or 20 Yards before we could get him down , and he struggled a little upon the Ground , but I believe that was rather to make away with what he had about him , than upon any other Account . Court . What Clothes had he on at that time ? Spencely . A dark Wig , a light Rug Coat , with a Red Coat under it . Prisoner . Was I drunk or sober ? Spencely . He was seemingly very sober . We brought him into the House and searched him . I examined his Right hand Coat Pocket , and took out a Handkerchief , a light Bob Wig , and this Ivory Whistle ; it has a single Call at one end , and a double Call at the other . You shall hear now - Here 's the single Call [ whistles ] - and here 's the double one [ whistle again . ] Mr. Peters . The Wig that Spencely found was not mine . Spencely . While we were searching him , the Landlady seem 'd to take the Prisoner 's part ; What ! are you going to rob the Man ? says she - He 's a substantial Innkeeper - and as he is a Gentleman , use him like one . I carried him before the Justice at Knights-bridge , and there the Things that were taken from him by several Persons were produced and put in a Hat . I saw there was a Mourning Ring among them with the Name of Dan . Brown upon it . Mr. Peters . I have People here , who made the Watch , the Ring , the Hat , and the Wig , if your Lordship pleases to have them called now ? Court . No ; six them first upon the Prisoner . Shew that they were in his Possession before you give any farther Proof of their being your Property . - Arundel , I am Landlord of the Halfway-House . On Monday the 26th of February , about 6 at Night , the Prisoner , on Horse-back , call 'd at my Door for 2 Mug of Beer ; he drank and did not stay a Quarter of an Hour , but went away , and came again in about half an Hour more . Then he alighted and came in a-doors , and I put his Horse in the Place where I Brew my Beer , for my Pigs were in the Stable . He call 'd for a Quartern of Brandy , and when he had stay 'd a little while , he bid me bring out his Horse , which I did , and he mounted , and rode away . It was then 7 a-Clock , or a little after . Court . Which way did he go ? Arundel . I do n't know . Mr. Peters . Had he but one Hat on then , or two ? Arundel . I saw but one Hat . He came a third Time , and call 'd at the Door for a Mug of Beer . It wanted then about 10 Minutes of 8 . We desir 'd him to come in , as People often ride into our Kitchen . He did so , and had another Quartern of Brandy , and would have had a third Quartern , but I did not care for drinking any more . Then he rode out again , and said , Now for London . Court . Had he one Hat or two when he call 'd this third Time ? Arundel . He had two Hats , and the uppermost had a Crape Hat-band - Presently after he was gone , Mr. Dukes a Distiller of Hammersmith came in , and said , You had a Highwayman drinking here just now . I do n't know what he was , says I , but he paid me honestly for what he had , and it was no Business of mine to inquire into other People 's Affairs ; tho ' if I had known as much before , I should have taken him if I could . Then Spencely came in and said , a Highwayman had been there on Horse-back , and that he saw him thro ' the Window , but was afraid to come in . While we were talking , the Prisoner came the fourth time to the Door , and cry 'd , Hollo ! I went to the Door , and catch 'd him fast by the Arm , and said , I take you on Suspicion of being a Highwayman . He snatch 'd his Arm away , and I catch 'd hold of the Lappet of his Great Coat . He made off 18 or 20 Yards , but I still hung by his Lappet , tho ' I could not have held much longer ; but then I fetch 'd him off his Horse , and said , I have him ! Spencely , I believe , was the next Man , for he was just by at the Door , when I came out ; but I think no Man was anewst me when I first seiz 'd the Prisoner ; then he was search 'd . Mr. Peters . Did he pull out a Watch when he came in with the two Hats ? Arundel . Yes . Mr. Peters . Had it a Chain ? Arundel . No ; it was a Silver Watch , I look 'd on it to see the Hour . Court . Is that the Watch ? Arundel . It was about this Size , but I ca n't swear to it . Prisoner . Was I drunk or sober ? Arundel . I do n't think he was quite sober , but he was thoroughly merry ; for if a Man is capable of sitting upon his Horse , I ca n't think , he can be said to be drunk . Susan Arundel . The Prisoner was 3 times at my House that Night , but I never saw him before . I took notice of him by his coming so often , but I knew nothing of him before . Court . The Court is not now enquiring how long you have known him , and therefore you need not be afraid on that Account . - Did you observe whether he had one Hat on or two ? S. Arundel . The first time he came into the House he had but one Hat ; but the second time he had two . Court . The second Time ? S. Arundel . Yes , the second time he came into the House . He was in the House but twice , for the first Time he call 'd , he only came to the Door . Court . Then it was the third Time of his calling , that you saw him with two Hats : Did he pull out a Watch then ? S. Arundel . Yes , he held it in the Palm of his Hand by the Fire-side . I said it was 8 a-Clock , but he said , it wanted 10 Minutes . Court . Had it a Chain or not ? S. Arundel . I saw no Chain . Court . Was it a Silver Watch or a Gold one ? S. Arundel . Silver . Then he paid , and went away , and presently Mr. Dukes came from Hammersmith , and said , we had a Highwayman there , who had robb 'd a Coach . Upon which I said to my Husband , My Dear , if he comes again stop him . After that there came in five or six People more , and the Prisoner came a fourth Time , and rid to the Door as usual ; says I , My Dear , that 's the Man , I beg you would go and take him . And with that my Husband went out , and the People follow 'd , and I heard them say that my Husband pull 'd the Prisoner off his Horse . Solomon Powell . I was call 'd out of my House , by a young Man and Harry Corney , to assist in taking a Highwayman , and after he was taken he was search 'd ; I did not see the Things taken from him , but when we came before the Justice , they were put in a Hat , and I saw among them a large Knife and a Whistle , and 16 s. 3 d. in Money . Henry Corney . I assisted in taking the Highwayman . The Prisoner is the same Person that we took . I saw him searched , and saw a Wig , a large Knife , a Whistle , some Powder and Ball , and 16 s. 3 d. taken from him . Court . Any Thing else ? Corney . Nothing else . Court . Recollect . Corney . Yes , there was three Keys . Court . Nothing else ? Corney . No ; the Wig had a black Seal in it ; I believe , this is the same . After the search I went out into the Road to the Place , where he was taken , and there I found two Hats one in another ; I brought them in , the Prisoner own 'd one of them , and the other had a black Crape Hat-band . I found a good double breasted brown Cape-Coat too ; but the Prisoner did not own it , nor did any Body else . We found a Loaded Pistol too , near the same Place , this is the same ; but this was not found till after he was carry 'd to the Round-house . Court . Do you know any thing of that Ring ? [ a Ring is shewn him , he looks at it and returns it . ] Corney . Yes , I remember now , that this Mourning Ring was taken out of his Breeches Pocket , at the Halfway-house . This is the very same , I am sure of it by the Name . Court . What Name ? Corney . Name - Name - let me see - it is - it is - Daniel Brown . John Wheeler . I was call 'd to aid Spencely , I believe the Prisoner is the same Man , that we then took at the Halfway-House . He was search 'd there , and I saw a large Knife , two Keys and a Whilstle , and some Money taken from him . Court . Any thing else ? Wheeler . I did not see any more taken from him ; but there was a Wig and a Watch produc 'd . John Gritton . Coming from Kensington , I met Kensington Stage-Coachman , and he told me , a Highwayman had robb 'd a Coach , and was gone into the Halfway-house . I went thither , and call 'd for a Mug of Beer ; by and by the Prisoner came to the Door , and Hollo 'd . The Landlord went out and I follow 'd , and assisted . The Landlord and the Prisoner struggled on the Ground together ; but in about 5 Minutes , we got the Prisoner into the House , and I took a Silver Watch out of his Hand . It had no String nor Chain , and there was a Cypher on the Back-side . This is the Watch , to the best of my Knowledge ; I kept it all Night in my Custody , and deliver 'd it to the Justice next Day . Justice Aldy . This is the same Watch that I had from that Witness . Gritton . I searched the Prisoner farther , and took a Wig with a black Seal in it out of his Coat Pocket - I believe this to be the same . I gave it to George Lines , who delivered it to the Constable or the Justice . The Prisoner stood still , and was easy while we search 'd him . George Lines . That 's the Wig that was taken from the Prisoner in the Halfway-house , I can swear to the Seal . I deliver 'd it to Justice Aldy , and the Justice gave it to the Constable . Prisoner . How was I dr ess 'd ? Lines . You had a black Wig , a light colour 'd Great-Coat , and a Red-Coat under that ? Prisoner . Was the Great-Coat Cloth ? Lines . Yes . Court . Are you sure of that ? Recollect . Lines . Yes , it was Cloth to the best of my Knowledge . William Wichelow , Constable . On Monday Night the 26th of Feb. the Beadle told me , that a Highwayman was apprehended , and I must come and take him into Custody ; I found him at the Beadle 's House , from whence he was carry 'd to the Round-house , and next Morning he was taken before the Justice . Several things were given me in a Hat ; there was a Whistle and three Keys , a Bag with some Powder , and five Bullets , and a Mourning Ring - this is the very Ring ; and the Justice gave me a Wig that was deliver 'd to him by George Lines ; this is the Wig , I have kept it ever since under Lock and Key . J. Walker . I was quarter 'd at Mr. Arnold 's [ Arundel 's ] House , where the Prisoner was taken . The second time he came into the House he had two Hats on , and the top Hat had a Mourning Hat-band . He asked what a Clock it was ; Somebody said near 8 , upon which he pulled out a Watch without a Chain . He ask 'd how far it was to Kensington ? I said half a Mile . Then he said , he 'd go to London . Soon after he was gone , Spencely the Baker came in , and enquired for him , and in a little time the Prisoner rid up to the Back-Door , and call 'd . I saw him thro ' the Window . I ask 'd him what he would have ? He said , A Mug of Beer , Soldier . I went into the Back-Parlour , and told my Landlord . Then I went out first , and took hold of the Prisoner 's Horse 's Bridle , and then my Landlord came out , and seiz 'd him . Upon which he spur 'd his Horse , and broke the Bridle out of my Hand , and as he turn 'd about ; my Landlord slipt his Hand , and catch 'd hold of the Lappet of the Prisoner 's Coat , and cry 'd , I have him . The Prisoner got Seven or Eight Yards from the Door , and then we secur 'd him . Court . Seven or Eight Yards ? Walker . It was there or thereabouts ; I wo n't swear to a Yard or two . The Prisoner was brought in , I saw two Wigs taken out of his Pocket . This Wig with the Black Seal is one of them ; there was a Whistle and a Ring too ; I heard it said before the Justice , that there was the Name of one Mr. Brown upon the Ring . There was a Purse of Powder found upon him too , and five Bullets , and a green Silk-Purse , with 16 s. 3 d. After he was search 'd , I and another Man went out with a Lanthorn and Candle to the Place where he was taken , and there we found two Hats stuck-together , the same that he had on in the House ; the outermost was a new Hat , with a Mourning Hat-Band . I left a Mark on it , and this is the very same . We found a brown Double-breasted-Coat too , I suppose he might let it fall , when he was pull 'd off the Horse . I brought all these Things into the House , and the Prisoner own 'd his own Hat , and his Wig that was in it . Charles Stafford . I was present when the Prisoner was taken ; I saw him search 'd , and two Wigs taken out of his Pocket , one of them had a black Seal ; a Mourning Ring was taken out of his Breeches Pocket , the Inscription upon it is Dan . Brown - this is the Ring . I held him while he was searched ; I had the Ring in my Hand , and look 'd on it , and so did others , but we did not then stand to read the Inscription . Court . You said it was inscribed , Dan . Brown ; when was it that you saw that Inscription ? Stafford . Not till we came before the Justice . John Garlick . Coming from Kensington , our Stage Coachman , Will . White , said there was a Robbery committed between Hyde-Park Corner and Knights-bridge , and the Highwayman was at the Half-way House , sitting on Horseback in the Kitchen . We went thither ; the Prisoner was gone ; but in a quarter of an Hour he came again , and knock 'd at the Door , and said , Hollo ! let 's have a Pint of Beer . Says Spencely , That 's the Man . The Landlord and Gritton went out and seiz 'd him , and cry 'd , Help ! I lifted the Prisoner up , and said Let 's bring him in , and see that he do n't kill some of us . Gritton took a Watch out of his Hand , and a Wig with a black Seal , out of his Pocket . The Watch had no String , nor Seal , nor Chain , and there was a Cypher on the Back , for I took Notice of it , and this is the same Watch . I took the Powder and Ball , and Ring , out of his Pocket , and I saw the two Hats taken up where the Prisoner was pull 'd off his Horse . Mr. Delander . I made this Watch for Mr. Peters , and I had it to mend about a Months ago . And this Ring is one of those I made for him , on his Uncle 's Death . The other Rings had the same Inscription . Mr. Gambl . I sold this Hat to Mr. Peters , I know it by my own Mark in the Crown . Robert Martin . I made this Wig , and sold it to Mr. Peters , and I put this black Seal in it ; and besides , I know it by the Work and the Caul , and by its being taken up at Ears . Prisoner . Pray let Gritton or the Constable be ask 'd if I was drunk or sober . Gritton . I believe he was drunk . Wichelow . And I believe so too , because after I had put him in the Watch-house , I heard him a hammering and thumping , and I called to him , and told him , I 'd be with him presently , and when came he had broke down the Bracket of a Bench ; I asked him why he did it ? And he said , he wanted to get out . Court . Is a Man 's endeavouring to get out of Custody a sign of his being drunk ? Prisoner . What Coat had I on ? Wichelow . A lightish-colour 'd Rug Coat , with a Nap Gritton . The Morning after the Prisoner was taken , he said , he believed the Ring and Watch would be of detriment to him . Prisoner . Yes , I said I had committed the Fact , they wou 'd be so - I own such Things were taken from me ; but I found them on the Road , and I was so drunk that I fell twice off my Horse at the Park Gate . And it is strange that a Man in such a Condition should in 5 or 6 Minutes afterwards commit a Robbery . Court . Have you any Witnesses to the Fact , or to your Character ? Prisoner . None to the Fact ; but I have several to my Character . Then he call 'd several Butchers ; but none appear 'd , except his Brother-in-law . Nathaniel Nellis . I have known the Prisoner 14 or 15 Years , and I know no Harm of him . Court . Were you intimate ? Nellis . Yes ; he lived in my Neighbourhood in Whitechapel . Court . What Business do you follow ? Nellis . I am a Butcher ; and he is the same Trade , but he does not follow it now . Court . And you swear you have known no Harm of him ? Nellis . Not to me , not any that belongs to me . Court . You know that 's not the Question . On your Oath , Sir , ( and consider what you swear ) has he the Character of an honest Man or a Highwayman ? Nellis . I have said all that I know , and I can go no farther . Court . Give a direct Answer . What 's his general Character ? Nellis . Why - why - some - some will call him an honest Man ; and - and - and - Court . And what ? Nellis . And some will - say otherwise - they will call him a Rogue - but I never called him so . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 54. Thomas Baker of Harefield , was indicted for stealing a Linnen Cap , 19 Guineas , and a Broad Piece , the Goods and Money of Ralph Trumper , Feb. 5 . Trumper and Baker were Servant s in the same House ; Trumper 's Chest was broke open , and his Money and the Night-cap in which he kept it were taken away . Three Weeks afterwards he found a Cap in a Chair by Baker 's Bed-side , which he swore was the Cap that his Money was in when he lost it , and 8 Guineas and 6 s. were found in Baker 's Chest . The Cap was produced in Court . Trumper 's Sister swore that she made that very Cap for her Brother out of the Tail of his Shirt , and knew it to be the same by a particular Seam which was run together and fell 'd like a Petticoat Seam , it not being usual to make such Seams in Night-caps . In answer to this , says Baker 's Mother ( upon her Oath ) if I have a Soul to be saved ( as I hope I have ) I made this Cap for my Child out of the Tail of my Husband 's Shirt ; I double-crown 'd it on both sides , and run it along a-this-fashions - you , did you say , Goody Baker ? Yes indeed did I , Goody Trumper ; and besides , I can swear to the Cap by these two Holes - Well , and I can swear by the same Holes that it 's my Brother 's Cap . And pray now what sort of Cloth was your Son 's Cap made of ? - Cloth ; why , it was an ordinary coarse Cloth . Coarse ; but what sort I say ? - why , it was Flax . - Flax ; very well ! now my Brother 's Cap was made of Dowlas , and this Cap here is Dowlas , I 'll take my Oath o n't ; and pray Goody Baker do you call Dowlas , Flax ? - Yes , I do - Do you so ? But I say Dowlas and Flax are two Things - No Matter for that , you shall never persuade me that I do n't know the Cloth that this Cap is made of , when I cut it out of the Tail of my Husband 's Shirt ; sure I have seen it often enough ! The Jury acquitted him . 55. Catherine Tracey was indicted for privately stealing 6 Guineas and 2 half Guineas from the Person of George Binnington , March 31 . George Binnington . On Saturday last I went with my Fellow-Servants to see Chelsea Hospital , and coming back in the Evening we went into a House to drink ; the Prisoner and another Woman were at the Door , and they went up with us without asking . Court . You were glad of their Company however ? George Binnington . Yes , to my Sorrow ; we drank a Glass of Ale together , and I must needs own we were very busy and familiar . The Prisoner led me to the Bed-side , and leading me to the Bed-side , I tumbled her upon the Bed ; and tumbling her upon the Bed , I felt her Hand at my Fob Pocket ; and feeling her Hand at my Fob Pocket , I got up ; and getting up , I declared that she had stole 7 Guineas from me . Upon this the other Woman asked me , what Present I would make her if she got me my Money again ? I offer 'd a Crown , she puffed at that ; I bid her 10 s. but that would not do neither ; then I said I would take 6 Guineas for the whole . No , the Prisoner said , if I would take five Guineas , and be easy , I should have them , and so she put five Guineas into my Hand , and putting them into my Hand the Constable came up that moment ; ( for I sent for a Constable when I miss 'd my Money ) and the Constable coming up , he carried her before his Majesty the Justice . Court . Was the Money in a Purse , or loose in your Pocket ? G. B . It was in a Purse , but she had taken the Gold out of the Purse , and was putting the Purse into my Fob again ; for when I felt her it was half in and half out . A Juryman . Were your Breeches up or down when you lost the Money ? G. B. I must acknowledge my Breeches were loose , a n't please you . Prisoner . Where was the other Woman when we were tumbling upon the Bed ? G. B . At the Door with my Fellow-Servant . P. Was not she at the Bed-side ? G. B . She did come to the Bed-side indeed , but not upon the Bed . P. Did not you shove me up Stairs ? G. B. I did not shove her , nor touch her , till she came into the Room . P. Was you drunk or sober ? G. B . Very sober . P. You swear this against me because I would not comply with all your Humours , but you gave the other Woman a Note , and conveyed her away , because she did any thing that you desired her . G. B . There was a little Writing indeed , but that was before I got any of my Money again ; my Fellow-Servant wrote it , to signify , that if the Prisoner would return us so much we would acquit her , but she did not dissolve to give me the money then , and so the Note was riven , and I sent for a Constable ; the other Woman got away while we were bargaining . P. No , they let her go , because they had carnal Dealings with her , and they would have been concerned with me in the same way , but I said I would not do any such Thing when there were four Men in Company , and therefore they beat me . Thomas Newsham and Samuel Coleman confirmed the Prosecutor 's Evidence . Thomas Thomas , Constable . A Gentleman 's Servant called me to go to a House in Hedge-Lane , in St. Martin 's Parish ; when I came into the Room , I found the Bed taken off the Bedstead , and laid on the Floor ; the Prosecutor charged me with the Prisoner , and I carried her before the justice , who order 'd her to be searched . I searched her Pocket , and found no more than 2 s. and she offer 'd to go aside and let me search her as far as I would . P. He might easily lose his Money , when his Breeches hung down to his Shoes , though I never touch 'd it . But as soon as he miss 'd it , he swore , Sir , as I do to you , Aye , G - d - the Bitch she has pick 'd my Pocket . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 10d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 56. William Ward , of Stepney , was indicted for assaulting John Wightman , on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him one Guinea , and 6s . 6d . Feb. 27 . He was a second Time indicted for assaulting John Lloyd on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 7 s. Feb. 27 . Mr. Lloyd . On Tuesday , the 27th of Feb. about a Quarter past 7 , in the Evening , as we were coming in a Coach from Ilford , the Coach was stopt a little on this side the turning that goes to Stepney . I let down the Glass , and the Prisoner came to the Door , and presented a Pistol within the Coach . Pray Friend , says I , take away your Pistol , which he did . Mr. Wightman , who sat on the other side , said , What 's the Matter ? Why , do n't you see his Pistol ? says I . Upon that Mr. Wightman starts up , and says , I have got two half Guineas , and some Silver , and I 'll give them you presently . Mr. Wightman gave him something ; but not satisfied with that , the Prisoner would search him , and then making me stand up , he searched me . Court . Are you certain that the Prisoner is the Man ? Had you any Light to see him by ? Mr. Lloyd . Yes , a Servant attended the Coach with a Moon , and I saw the Prisoner plainly by that ; I look 'd full at him all the Time . The Moon was a little way off , as far perhaps , as from your Lordship to me ; but it was so placed , that it cast a Light into the Coach . After the Prisoner had robb 'd us , my Coachman leaning from his Box , I heard a Pistol go off , at which the Horses started and run forward . Next Morning I went to Newgate , and desir 'd the Keeper to let me see the Man who was committed . the last Night for such a Robbery ; the Person who went to show me the Prisoner , told me , I should not see him singly , because it was a Case , in which a Man 's Life was in Danger . This I thought was Humanity ; and as it was what I little expected to find in Newgate , I was the more pleas 'd with it , and gave the Man some Money . He brought me to a Place , where the first Man I happen 'd to cast my Eye on , was the Prisoner : I knew him immediately , and said , That 's the Man that robb 'd me . The Prisoner answer 'd , I am sorry that I ever saw you . Prisoner . Mr. Lloyd has been to Mr. Akerman , the former Turnkey , to know if I had not been in Jail before . Mr. Wightman . When the Coach was stopt ( as Mr. Lloyd has Sworn ) I ask 'd what was the Matter ? Mr. Lloyd said , Do n't you see ? And I then perceiv 'd the Prisoner presenting a Pistol in the Coach . Says I , pray be civil , I have a Guinea and some Silver . I gave him two half Guineas , and he took half a Crown and some Shillings out of my Pocket . I desir 'd him to leave my Keys , and he said he had . He ask 'd me , for my Watch , and I told him I had none . My Man rode before the Coach with a Moon , that had 3 Candles in it . But there was another Highwayman , who brought my Man back with the Moon , to the Head of the Wheel-Horses , so that by that Light , I had a full view of the Prisoner , for he had no Mask , and am as positive , as I can be of any thing , that he is the Man who robb 'd us . Richard Bulkley . I was in the Coach with Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Wightman , when they were robb 'd ; but they turn 'd so directly to the Coach-Door , that I could not see that Highwayman 's Face , and for the same Reason , I believe , he hardly observ 'd me ; but I saw the other Highwayman bring the Moon back near to the Coach , and stand over him , to prevent an Alarm . I had got my Money ready to deliver , when the Coachman getting off his Box , fell upon the Highwayman next us ; I heard one cry , Shoot ! Shoot ! and presently a Pistol went off , which I suppose , was fir 'd by the other Highwayman ; the Horses started at the Noise , and ran to the Turnpike . Oxton Chapman . I carry 'd the Moon , and coming thro ' Mile-End , at the End of the Dog-Row , a Highwayman rode up to me , and said , if I offer 'd to open my Lips he 'd shoot me thro ' the Head directly . While the other was robbing the Coach , the Coachman jump 'd off , and knok 'd him down . Then I got off my Mare , and help 'd the Coachman , till farther Assistance came , and the Prisoner was not out of my Possession , till he was taken into Custody . James Price , Coachman . When the Highwaymen stopt the Moon-Man , I thought it had been a Quarrel , and cry 'd Hai ! what would you be at ? I shall make one among you presently ! With that , the Prisoner comes up to me , and says , You saucy old Rogue , I know you well enough , and I have a good mind to shoot you thro ' the Head - Stand ! And my Master called to me and said , Stand , James ! The Prisoner went and robb 'd the Coach ; and the Light being betwixt me and the other Highwayman , I thought he could not well see to shoot me , and I knew the Prisoner could not , because his Head was in the Coach , and upon that Consideration I struck at the Prisoner twice , and knock 'd him down dead . Court . But he came to Life again ? Price . Yes , yes ; for at the second Blow he call 'd to his Comrade and bid him shoot , and shoot he did ; Aha ! says I , * thee hast mist me , but I have hit + thee . * To the Highwaymen who fired . + To the Prisoner . Court . Are you sure the Prisoner is the Man you knock 'd down ? Price . Sure ? yes ; I mark 'd him well enough to know him again , besides he was never out of my Custody till he was carried before the Justice , and so sent to Newgate . The Prisoner 's Defence . George Bird . Coming between Stratford and Bow I saw the Coach stop , and saw the Coachman make a Blow at the Prisoner , and knock him down , and I went to assist , and no Body meddled with him but the Coachman and I . Court . Is this the Prisoner 's Witness ? He confirms the Prosecutor 's Evidence ; the Prosecutor should have call 'd him . Bird . The Prosecutor would not have me call 'd , because his man should have all the Reward , tho ' I ventur 'd my Life as well as he when the Pistol was fired . I pick 'd up a Pistol where the Coach stood . Prisoner . Was no Body knock 'd down but me ? Bird . Yes , Mr. Vanghan , who came to assist too ; but I believe , the Coachman mistook him for one of the Highwaymen . Prisoner . The Moon-Man said in Smithfield , that he 'd hang me right or wrong , for the Reward , and he own 'd he never see me before that Night . Court . But it appears you was taken in the very Fact , carry 'd directly before the Justice , and committed to Newgate . There can be no Pretence that you are not the Person . Prisoner . I was vastly in Liquor , and coming by the Coach I was knock 'd down . Roger Smith . I have known the Prisoner these 20 Years , his Father and Mother were People of honest Character , and he himself was well educated at Exeter , and put Apprentice to a Painter , I never heard any Ill of him before . Court . Has he follow 'd his Business lately ? Smith . Yes . John Williams . The Prisoner has dealt in Hors es for three Years past . John Porfit . I keep the White-Hart Inn in High-Holbourn , the Prisoner sometimes us 'd my House , I have known him about a Year ; I always took him to be a civil , sober , sedate Man , and did not imagine he would be guilty of any such thing as this . Mr. Wightman . I beg leave , my Lord , to ask Bird , if he knew the Prisoner before the Night he was taken ? Bird . Yes , when I came to see his Face . Prisoner . When they search 'd me before the Justice , they took 4 Guineas and a half , of my own Money , and they ca n't say that they found any other Money about me . Mr. Lloyd . He put the Money that he took from Mr. Wightman and me in his Mouth , and I have since heard , that some Money and a Pistol was found in the Road where he was taken . Court . Sir , you must speak no farther than your Knowledge ; what you heard is no Evidence . Prisoner . I hope your Lordship will order that I may have my own Money again , or that my Wife and Children may have it . Court . The Court can give no Order about it till the Jury have brought in their Verdict , and if they find you Guilty , the Money is forfeited . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 57. Mary Price , was indicted for stealing a Gold-Ring , the Property of John Bolton ; but no Evidence appearing she was acquitted . 58. Joseph Dennis , was indicted for stealing 115 pair of Shoes , and 5 pair of Clogs , the Goods of Hannah Fenton , in her House , Oct. 28 . and , 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 63. Sarah Harris , Eleanor Conyers , Jane Conyers , Ann Dram , and Sarah Fletcher , for receiving Part of the said Goods , knowing them to be stolen . The Principal was found Guilty to the Value of 39 s. Eleanor Conyers and Sarah Fletcher guilty as Accessaries , and Sarah Harris , Jane Conyers , and Ann Dram acquitted . [ Dennis , Eleanor Conyers : Transportation . See summary . ] [ Fletcher : Branding . See summary . ] 64 , 65. William Stedman , the Younger , and William Stedman , the Elder , of St. Leonard Bromley , were indicted for Forging and Counterfeiting , and causing to be Forged and Counterfeited , a certain Paper call 'd a promissory Note , for 1 l. 15 s. 9 d. in these Words , Settled an Account this fifth Day of August 1732 , between William Stedman and John Turner , when appears due to William Stedman the Sum of 1 l. 15 s. 9 d. which I promise to pay to the said William Stedman , at 2s . 6 d. a Week , till the said Sum of 1 l. 15 s. 9 d. be paid by me I. T. The Mark of John Turner . And for uttering the said forged and counterfeit Note , knowing it to be Forged and Counterfeited , by which Means they did feloniously receive , and defraud the said John Turner , of the said Sum of 1 l. 15 s. 9 d. The Jury acquitted 'em . 66. William Keys , of Finchly , was indicted for assaulting Richard Richardson , on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him , 2 Guineas , Jan. 27 . Mr. Richardson . On the 27th of January , about Two in the Afternoon , my Chariot was stopp 'd on Finchly-Common , by the Prisoner on Horse-back . He held a Pistol to my Breast , and demanded my Money , and threaten 'd to shoot me dead if I did not deliver . I gave him two Guineas ; and I am very positive to his Person , for I look 'd full in his Face all the Time he was robbing me , which was about a Minute , and I have since seen him at Hertford . Prisoner . What Clothes had I on ? Mr. Richardson . A great Coat , with a large Cape ; but I can swear more positive than his Clothes , for he had no Mask , nor any manner of Disguise , not so much as the Cape of his Coat turn 'd up . Joseph Joice . I was behind the Coach . The Prisoner rid up to the Coachman , and said , If he did not stand , he 'd shoot him thro ' the Head that Moment . Then he went to the Coach-Door , and putting his Pistol into the Coach , he demanded my Master 's Gold , and said , he would shoot him , dead if he did not deliver that Moment ; my Master gave him something ; but he was not contented with it , for he said , he must have more , he would search himself ; and then he put his Hand into the Coach . He had a brown Cape-Coat , with the Cape down ; he had no Disguise , and I had a full view of his Face , and am very sure that this is the Man . Prisoner . Did you never own to your Master that you did not know me ? Joice . No ; I had no Reason so to do , for I remember both your Face and your Voice . James Jones . I was on the Coach-box ; the Prisoner came leering along , and gallop 'd up to my Horse 's side . Damn you , says he , Stand ! or I 'll shoot this Minute . Then he went to the Chariot , and said to my Master , If you do n't deliver your Money this Minute , by God I 'll shoot ! He was bare-faced ; I observed that his Hand shook , and I thought I had seen his Face before , but I could not recollect where , nor when . Prisoner . When you came to see me in Hertford Jail , you said you did not know me . Jones . No ; I told him I had seen him before ; and upon that he turned about and said , I might see him behind too . Prisoner . You said the man that did the Robbery had Grey Eyes and Grey Eyebrows . Jones . I never said any such Word ; I pick 'd him out from half the Jail . Prisoner . You had no Occasion to view me a second time , if you had known me at first ; but I shall prove that I was in London when the Robbery was done . Peter Kenny . The Prisoner was at Work with me all that Day . Court . What Day ? Kenny . The 27th of January last . Court . What Business do you follow ? and where do you live ? Kenny . I live at the White Perriwig in Duke-street in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields ; I am a Perriwig-maker , and the Prisoner is the same Trade . Court . Are you a Housekeeper ? Kenny No ; I keep a Shop there , but not the whole House . I have been there 2 Years . I served part of my time at the Corner of Bow-street , and lived there five Years for my self . Court . Are you sure the Prisoner was all Day at your Shop on the 27th of January . Kenny . He was my Journeyman from September last to the half an Hour past 8 , on the 14th of February following . On Friday Night , the 26th of January , we lay together ; he got up to Work next Morning at 7 o'Clock , and he worked with me till 8 that Night . We both work 'd at one Table , he at one end , and I at the other , and I was not out of his Company in all that time , except about 2 o'Clock , when I went to the King's-Head over the way to get a Pint of Beer , but I was not absent above half an Hour . Court . How came you to take such particular Notice of the 27th of January ? was there any thing remarkable in that Day ? Kenny . The 27th of January was a Saturday , which is always a very busy Day with us ; and therefore he could not be absent that Day without my taking particular Notice of it . Then he went out of Town the 14th of February , which was but 2 Weeks and odd Days , and 4 or 5 Days afterwards he sent me a Letter that he was in Hertford Jail , and this put me upon recollecting the Day . Court . What Countryman are you ? Kenny . I have no need to deny my Country ; I was born in Ireland . John Myers . The Prisoner owed me a little money , and on Saturday being the 27th of January , at half an Hour past 2 , I went to his Master 's Shop in Duke-street to ask for it . Court . What Business are you ? Myers . A Surgeon . Court . How came you to be so punctual as to the time ? Myers . A Patient came to me just after Dinner , and as soon as I had dispatched him I went to the Prisoner , and found him and his Master at work together . His Master went over the way to the Alehouse soon after I came , and then I asked the Prisoner for the money , but he did not pay me . Court . Did you stay till his Master came back ? Myers . No ; I did not stay above a Quarter of an Hour . William Lynch . The Prisoner used to drink at my House , in Prince's-street ; I know he lived with Mr. Kenny , and was a very civil Man . Edmund Birk . I bespoke a Wig of Mr. Kenny , and desired to have it made by Friday or Saturday ; I called there on Saturday between 10 and 11 in the morning as I was going to the other end of the Town , and I called again as I came back , betwixt one and two , and I saw the Prisoner there ( at both times ) at work in a Banyan , with his Master - I live in Spittle-Fields . Arthur Lynch . The Prisoner has been my Servant ; I knew him first at Cales in Spain ; He then liv 'd with a Peruke-maker who work 'd for me . But afterwards , being out of Business , I took him into my Service . He was with me about a month in Spain , and then I brought him over with me , and he continued 2 months in my Service here . He had a fair Character in Spain ; I trusted him with my Clothes and other Things , and when he left me he return 'd his Charge . Prisoner . One man 's Face may be like another 's ; the Prosecutor and his Servants , who never saw me before I was apprehended , may be mistaken ; but my Witnesses have known me for a considerable time . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 67 , 68. Ann Hideman and Caleb Jones were indicted for receiving 60 lb . of Lead , the Property of Leonard Philips , ( of stealing which William Dowland and Christopher Boyle were convicted last Sessions ) knowing it to be stolen . Acquitted . 69. William Harper , of St. Mary At-Hill , was indicted for privately stealing a Bag , and 6 Guineas , and 39 s. from the Person of Matthew Monger , March 9 . Matthew Monger . As I was going from my Vessel to Dinner upon St. Mary-Hill , there was a Throng of Carts at the Foot of the Hill ; I saw the Prisoner a little before me . He turn 'd back at the sore Part of a Coach ; we met , I stepp 'd aside to give the Way ; he jostled me , I gave way again , and he jostled me a second Time . I ask 'd him , what he meant by it ? And as I look 'd him in the Face , I felt the Bag drawn out of my Pocket . He got past me ; but upon missing my Bag , I turn 'd back upon him , seiz 'd him by the Shoulder , and said , You . Rascal , you have robb 'd me ! As I spoke , I saw my Bag upon the Ground . He stampt upon it , and said , If you have lost any Thing , there it is - Let me go . No , says I , I do n't know but you may have taken something out of it . I took the Bag up , and sent for a Constable . We carry 'd the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor Alehouse , and search 'd him ( because another Man had lost 17 Guineas the same Day ) and we found a Guinea and a Half upon him . Prisoner . Did you find any of your Money upon me ? M. Monger . No ; my Money was all in the Bag . Prisoner . Did you see me drop the Bag ? M. Monger . No ; but no Body was so near me as the Prisoner , when I lost the Money , nor any Body , except my self , so near the Bag when it was dropt , as the Prisoner was , by some Yards . Prisoner . There was a Crowd of People about us . M. Monger . There were several People not far of ; but none besides the Prisoner , were at that Time , near enough to take the Bag or drop it . Juryman . When you felt the Bag drawn out off your Pocket , was there no Body but the Prisoner near enough to have taken it ? M. Monger . We were betwixt the Wall and a Coach , and there was none but he and I there , within the length of that Coach , and I catch 'd him within ten Steps . Daniel Gough . I was at the Post at the Bottom of the Hill . The Prisoner stept over , and the Prosecutor follow 'd and collar 'd him , and said , he had robb 'd him . I heard something drop at that Time . It chinck 'd like Money . I look 'd and saw the Purse in the Prosecutor 's Hand , and it was dirty . He call 'd for a Constable , and I went for one . Prisoner . Did you see me drop it ? D. Gough . No ; I only heard it fall , and it fell at your Feet . Juryman . Was any Body near the Prosecutor and the Prisoner , when the Purse was dropp 'd . D. Gough . I ca n't be positive how near , but no Body was close . There might be some Body within a Yard or two ; but I ca n't say whether there were or no . John Mason . At the Blue Anchor before the Bag was open 'd , the Prosecutor said , there was in it , 6 Guineas , 39s . a Two-Sons ( French ) Piece , and a broken Watch-Key . Then we empty 'd the Bag , and the Contents agreed exactly with what he said . M. Monger . I had that Money and Key in the Bag , but I thought there was no need to put the Two-Sous Piece , and the Key in the Indictment . Prisoner . I shall prove that the Prosecutor dropt the Bag himself . Thomas Jefferies . I am a Bricklayer 's Labourer ; as I was going behind a Man at the Corner of St. Mary Hill ( just against the Place where the Coal-Porters walk ) I saw something drop from this Man like a white Bag , and I took it . Court . Did you take it up ? T. J . Yes ; and says the Man , What have you taken up ? A Bag , says I . Is it yours ? says he . No ; says I . Why , then it 's mine , says he . How do you know ? says I . Because , says he , I just now dropt it . And so I gave it into his Hand : And in a little better than a Minute , he said , his Pocket was pick 'd of a Bag , of a Purse . Court . Did he say of that Bag ? T. J . He said a Bag , but not whether it was that Bag or another . Court . Did he not say , that he had the Person ( who pick 'd his Pocket ) in Custody . T. J . He had not miss 'd the Bag , before I took it up ; but in a Minute or 2 after , he challeng 'd the Prisoner . Court . Was you acquainted with the Prisoner before this ? T. J . No . Court . How came you hither ? T. J . The Mob desir 'd me . Pris . I supoena 'd him . Court . When you saw the Prisoner was charg 'd with stealing the Bag , did you take any Notice to any Body that you had found it ? T. J . Yes ; I spoke of it there , and upon that the Prisoner ask 'd me , who I was , and where I liv 'd ? I told him I liv 'd in Westminster , and so I went about my Business , and he afterwards sent a Porter to me . Court . Whether was you going then ? T. J . To my Master , a Bricklayer in St. Catherine 's , for whom I was to go to work at Greenwich . Court . What 's his Name ? T. J. William Dowland . Court . It would have been a friendly Part if you had gone before the Justice . or but to the Blue-Anchor , to have clear 'd an innocent Man , by giving the same Account , as you have done here . How happen 'd it that you did not ? T. J. I thought it was no Concern of mine , and so I went to my Work . William Rowland . My Wife sells Oysters . I went that very Day with her to Billingsgate to help her up with them , and while I was waiting , I saw the Prosecutor drop something in a white Bag like Money , and presently he ran after the Prisoner , who was 6 or 7 Yards off , and charged him with picking his Pocket , and there was 5 or 6 People following , and some Man took up the Bag . Court . Did you hear any Words between the Prosecutor and Prisoner ? W. R. Yes ; I heard something when the Prisoner was taken ; but I was afraid I should lose my Wife in the Hurly-burly , and so I went away , and my Wife speaking of it afterwards , some Body ask 'd her where she liv 'd , and so the Prisoner came to find me out . Jane Cook . In my way to Orange-Lane , I went to Billingsgate to buy some Fish , and I heard an Uproar as how they had taken the Prisoner for the Reward , and there was another man ran away towards Tower-Hill ; but the Prisoner walked very slow 6 or 7 Yards from the Prosecutor who ran after him to catch him , and said he had pick 'd his Pocket . Court . Did the Prosecutor say so before he had taken the Prisoner ? J. C. Yes . Henry Allen . I live in Moorfields ; as I was by Billingsgate there stood a Gentleman , and a man pick 'd up something White , and the Gentleman said it was his , and the man gave it to him , and the Gentleman said he believed his Pocket was pick 'd ; but I met the Prisoner 6 Yards off before the money was pick 'd up ; but I was upon urgent Business , and could not stay to see the upshot . I was afterwards drinking at a House in Moorfields , and there happened to be an Acquaintance of the Prisoner 's there , and I was telling him what I had seen , and so he desired me to come and give Evidence . Court . Pray , what was your urgent Business ? H. A. I was going to a Dutch Hambro ' merchant in St. Katharine 's . C. What 's his Name ? H. A. Mr. Carle ; he keeps an Alehouse at the Prince of Sweden 's Head . C. A Hambro ' merchant , and keep an Alehouse ? H. A . Yes , my master used to serve him with Muffs . C. What Trade is your master ? H. A . A Weaver ; he lives in Chissel-street , C. A Weaver , and make muffs ? H. A . He 's a muff maker too as well as a Weaver . C. What 's his Name ? H. A. Mr. Wilmot . Ann Sulvan . I live in Bunhill-Fields ; I went to Rag-Fair with Betty Matthews to buy some Linings for a Gown ; and from thence we went to Billingsgate to buy some Eels , and just as we came thither there was a little Crowd , and a Gentleman said he was robbed , and he stepped after a young man and seized him , and said , You took my Money , and I 'll have you to the Compter ; and so we went to Billingsgate , and in going home we saw some People in Bread-street hard by the Justice 's Door , and they told us the young man was sent to Newgate ; and so we went to Newgate , and told him what we had seen , and where we lived . Elizabeth Matthews . I am a Mantua-maker I live in Smithfield ; as we were going to Billinsgate to buy Fish , there was a Dispute ; the Prosecutor ran after the Prisoner ( who was walking gravely and moderately a few Yards before him ) and the Prosecutor said to the Prisoner , If you wo n't give me my Money , I 'll send you to the Compter . So they carried the Prisoner to the Blue-Anchor , and then they put him in a Coach to go before Alderman Brocas , and we follow 'd ; but before we came there he was sent to Newgate ; and we went to him there , not that we had any Acquaintance with him , but only out of good Nature . C. Officer , take Sulvan out of Court while this Witness is examined ; what did you and Sulvan do at Billingsgate ? E. M. We cheapened some Eels . C. Did either of you buy any ? E. M. No . C. What did you buy at Rag Fair ? E. M. Some old Linnen for Body Linings . C. Of whom ? E. M. Of a Woman that stands in the Fair . C. How much money did you lay out ? E. M. About four Shillings . C. Was the other Woman with you then ? E. M. No ; we both went into an Alehouse , and had a Pint of Beer ; I left her there , and went and bought the Linnen , and then I went to her again . C. Where did you part after you went from Newgate ? E. M. At Pye-Corner , and then I went home . C. At what time ? E. M. Between 2 and 3 o'Clock . C. Now bring the other Woman in again ? Officer . My Lord , she 's run away . C. Why did you let her go , when she was committed to your Care ? Officer . My Lord , thought she was only to be put out of Court . Joseph Whatley . The Prisoner used my House , the Bull and Mouth in Bloomsbury-Market ; he has kept his Horse there these 5 or 6 Weeks , and 't is there now . C. Did he appear to follow any Business ? J. W. I do n't know as to that , he appeared as a Gentleman , or a Tradesman . C. Do n't you think it reasonable when a Stranger lies at an Alehouse 5 or 6 Weeks to enquire who or what he is ? J. W. That was no Business of mine as long as he behaved like a good hones t Man . Prisoner . 'T is the greatest murder in the World to send me to Jail for nothing at all . The Jury found him Guilty .

Her Son Will . and I have gone a thieving together these three Months . Norman . Powers swears this against me , because he knows I have been under Misfortunes , and have been an Evidence in this Court . But I have Witness that I was sick on the 2d and 3d of January , when this Fact was done . Jemima Burleigh . I lodge in the same House with Norman , in Bambridge-Street in St. Giles 's . On the 2d and 3d and 4th of January he was ill abed . C. How came you to remember those Days any more than any other ? J . B. I have cause to remember the 4th of January , for it was my Wedding-Day 24 Years ago , and I have acknowledged it ever since , and I had a Bit of roast Pork that Day ; and Norman and his Wife were both sick of the new Distemper , and they had Rosemary and Treacle , and they both eat some of my roast Pork . C. Then they were not so bad but they could eat Pork ? Did you never see Powers at your House . J . B. I do n't know him . - But I can swear that Norman was not abroad the Day before the 4th of January ; for I was at home all that Week , though sometimes I go a Nursing . C. Can you be positive that you was not out at all in the Evening of the 3d of January ? J . B. I ca n't say as to that - I might be out in the Evening . - Eliz . Morris . I own I had an undutiful Son , but I could not help what he did ; for if I spoke but a Word , he would presently beat and abuse me . I have often forbid Powers coming to my House . Wm Hadly . I am a Smith , I work for Mrs. Morris , and have lived in the House seven or eight Years . Her Husband has left her these two Years . Her chief Business is making Stove-Grates . I never knew that she bought any Goods but old Iron . Powers would come to her House , and set her Son to quarrel with her ; and while her Son was beating and abusing her , Powers would sit in the Chair and laugh . If she had bought stolen Goods I must have seen 'em , for she has no back Room . C. Do you know nothing of a Trap-Door under her Bed ? Hadly . There is a Place under her Bed where she puts her Files , but it is a turn-up Bed . Francis Skelborn . I sell Stove Grates , and she works for me and for Mr. Sparks in the Strand , and Mr. Child at Temple-Bar . I have laid out 40 l. a Year with her .

I have lived in the same Court four Years , and I always took her for an honest , industrious , well-living Woman . Mary Whitehead . I have known her ten or eleven Years . She deals with me for Coals , and I never knew but she had an honest Character , 'till I heard of this . Wm Rancy . I have known her three and twenty Years , and have work 'd seven Years in the House before she came . I recommended her and her Husband to take the Shop , and I work 'd for them seven Years . The Hole under the Bed was made before she took the House . It was on purpose to put Files in , that they might not all be in Use at a Time , but be delivered out as they were wanted .

When she was before the Justice , she confess 'd that if she could not have found an Opportunity of getting the Money so easily as she did , her Husband ( as she call 'd him ) wouldhave come and murder 'd both her Mistress and the Child . M. Fleetwood . It has terrify 'd me so , that I could never since lye down to sleep at rest . John Fairclough . Those who took the Prisoner , lodg 'd in the Prosecutor 's House , and knew the Prisoner 's Haunts . I was present when she return 'd 16 Guineas and a Moidore , and I heard her say before the Justice . It was well I had such an Opportunity of taking the Money , or else , my Husband , who put me upon it , would have made me have murder 'd my Mistress and her Daughter . Prisoner . When I went to my Mistress , we agreed to part at any time , without Warning , I pick 'd up the Money from the Ground ; and my Mistress and I having had some Words , and my Husband calling upon me just after , he would not let me stay any longer , and so I went away with him .
