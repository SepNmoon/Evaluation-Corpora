Mrs. Millington depos 'd , That she gave the Prisoner a Muslin Handkerchief some Time since , and she did believe it to be the very same mention 'd in the Indictment , it being shew 'd to her , and for the Lace that was sew 'd to it , she very well remember 'd that the Prisoner shew 'd her a Piece of Lace which was given her by a Person since dead , and she did believe the Lace to be the very same : Several others appearing to her good Character , the Jury acquitted her .

She said in her Defence , That the Prosecutor , her Mistress , did not pay her all the Wages due to her when she came away , but gave her those Goods as Part of the Payment ; but this Excuse differing very much from that of her Mother 's sending them to her , and the Prosecutor making it appear she paid all her Wages , and that the Goods were taken clandestinely , the Jury found her guilty of Single Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] Elizabeth Appleyard and Dorothy Nyehouse , were indicted for feloniously stealing three Linnen Sheets . two Shifts , two Napkins , two Table Cloths , a Pair of Stockings , and some Money , the Property of Charles Cole .

Hannah Haywood , of St. Sepulchre 's , was indicted for stealing a considerable Quantity of Money the Property of Francis Peachey , in the Dwelling-House of William Chancey on the 17th of August last . It appeared by the Deposition of Elizabeth Peachey , that her Husband being in the Hospital , and a Person who went for the Prisoner 's Husband lying in the Hospital at the same Time , and dying there , the Prisoner being then in a miserable Condition , not having a Habitation to retire to , she , the Prosecutor , took Compassion on her , and suffered her to lie with her , and kindly supplied her with the Necessaries of Life , which she stood in need of ; but in the midst of all this Kindness and Humanity of the Prosecutor 's , the ungrateful Wretch took an Opportunity to open her Drawers and take all the Money she had in the World , though a Part of it was recovered when she was apprehended . The Constable depos 'd , That he heard her confess the taking the Money out of the Prosecutor 's Drawers ; the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 39 s . [ Transportation . See summary . ] Sarah Burgess and Elizabeth Glover , of St. Paul 's Covent-Garden were indicted for privately and feloniously stealing seven Guineas , from the Person of Jacob Miller , on the first of August , 1727 . Jacob Miller depos 'd , That Sarah Burgess happened to see him in Drury-Lane , and asked him to treat her with a Pint of Wine , which he refused , and presently after he happened to light of Elizabeth Glover , an old Friend of his , and she said , Mr. Miller , will you make me Drink ? which he consented to , and he went up to her Lodgings whilst she sent his House to an Inn , that Burgess followed him to Elizabeth Glover 's , and as Elizabeth Glover and he sate upon the Bed together , Sarah Burgess pick 'd his Pocket of a green Purse , in which was 16 Guineas , out of which she took 7 , and returned the other , that he caught her Hand in his Pocket , but did not know that she had taken his Money , but he understood she gave Elizabeth Glover one Guinea to hold her Tongue . Being ask 'd why he did not prosecute her sooner , this being done in 1727 , he said , the Jury at Hicks 's Hall would not find the Bill , and she had used him very ill since , or he had not indicted her now ; for they had been at Law together , and she had indicted him ; being ask 'd if he did not indict one Eleanor Lock a Twelvemonth since for this very Fact wherewith he charg 'd the Prisoners , he confess 'd he did , for she was in the Room . Mr. Cook depos 'd , That he heard Elizabeth Burgess confess she had taken 7 Guineas from Jacob Miller , that she left him 9 , and was sorry she had not taken it all . Sarah Burgess desiring the Prosecutor might be ask 'd if she had not recovered a Judgment and Execution on him for Money due to her for Liquors he had of her , after some hesitation he confess 'd she had , though he would fain have equivocated on that Head . Several other Witnesses being examined , it appeared that Sarah Burgess and the Prosecutor Jacob Miller , had been at Law for some Time , and that he had said he would hang or transport her if possible , since she would not agree to his Terms , and their being another Law Suit now depending between them , it was look 'd upon as a malicious Prosecution ; so they were both acquitted , yet tho ' they begg 'd for a Copy of their Indictment it was not granted , they appearing to be a contentious wicked People ; the Court was not willing to give them further Occasion to exert their Malice . Edward Williams , of St. Paul 's Shadwell , was indicted for Feloniously stealing an Iron Loggerhead , a Cane , seven Brass Cocks , two Marling Pikes , and several other Things , from on Board the Upton Galley , the Property of William Coster , which appearing plain , the Jury found him guilty of single Felony .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] Mary Wiltshire , of St. Andrew 's Holborn , was indicted for privately and feloniously stealing some Money from the Person of John Boucer . The Prosecutor depos 'd ( by an Interpreter ) That he having lost his Pocket-Book , was inquiring for it at a House where the Prisoner was , and that they giving him some Encouragement , he called for Punch to make them drink , that presently the Prisoner took an Opportunity to pick his Pocket , and he finding his Money gone , charg 'd her with it , when she jump 'd out of the Window ; and being afterwards taken and carried to the Round-house , he offered her a Guineas to let him have his Seal again , which was likewise taken from him at the same Time as his Money was ; this , he said , he did to trap her , that he might fix the Fact upon her by some Evidence and accordingly his Scheme had the desired Effect , for she produced the Seal , and tho ' she afterwards denied receiving a Guinea on such Account , yet they found the Guineas upon her in her Hair . It further appeared , that one Harvey , whom one of the Witnesses was so hardy as to call the Bawd of the House , said , they would live well with the Money . She said in her Defence , That the Prisoner wanted to lie with her , and she refusing him , he began to Curse and Swear at her , and to avoid his Insults she got out of the Window ; but this Artifice had but little Effect , for it appear 'd she could not speak his Language ( French ) nor could he speak English . The Jury found her Guilty to the Value of 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] James How , alias Harris , was indicted for feloniously stealing Goods to the Value of 5 l. out of the House of John Spencer ; to which Indictment he refused to plead , pretending he expected to be admitted as an Evidence , but his Crimes were too notorious for that Liberty to he admitted him , yet the Court not willing immediately to order him to the Punishment which the Law directs on such Occasions , ordered the Sentence should be read to him , and indulg 'd him with Time to consider of it ; the Preamble is as followeth : That the Prisoner shall be sent to the Prison from whence be came , and put into a mean House stopp 'd from Light , and there shall be laid upon the bare Ground , without any Litter , Straw , or other Covering , and without any Garment about him , saving something to cover his Privy Members , and that he shall lie upon his Back , and his Face shall be covered and his Feet bare , and that one of his Arms shall be drawn with a Cord to one side of the House , and the other Arm to the other side , and that his Legs shall be used , in the same Manner ; and that upon his Body shall be laid so much Iron and Stone as he can bear , and more ; and that the first Day after be shall have three Morsels of Barley Bread , without any Drink , and the second Day he shall drink so much as he can three Times , of the Water which is next the Prison Door , saving running Water , without any Bread , and this shall be his Diet until be dies .

Other Witnesses confirm 'd that the Prisoners and another Drank together at the Coach and the Horses at Tottenham at the Time as swore by Barker ; and that Harris would seign have made himself an Evidence against the others , in expectation of which he discovered Medlin , who was not taken with him and Owen .

Henry Greenwood depos 'd , that he saw the Prisoner beat the Coachman , and then ask 'd his Master , the Prosecutor , for his Watch , which he said he had deliver 'd to another of them , that one of them took his Master 's Hat , but the others oblig 'd him to return it again , saying , he was a very civil Gentleman ; but this Deponent could not be Positive as to any of their Persons but the Prisoner 's This Fact likewise appearing plain , the Jury found him Guilty .
