 I saw my Wife , Mary Maurice , in the Bone-house , the Day the People were carried before the Justice : She had a white-colour 'd Gown , a black Petticoat , and red Shoes . Council . I must trouble a Gentleman I see upon the Bench with one Question . Colonel De Veil , do you know the Prisoner at the Bar . Colonel De Veil . I know him very well , Sir . Bird . Can a Man be a Witness that offered to lay five Guineas to one that I should be hanged ? Colonel De Veil . I never said such a Thing in my whole Life . I believe the Gentlemen that appear here upon this Occasion will declare , that I never spoke to one of them , but only sent them the Depositions . Bird . I have it so here . Colonel De Veil . At the hazard of my Life I went into the Mob , brought him off and saved his Life . Bird . That was after you had published it in the News , and made me appear to be as cruel a Dog as ever lived . Colonel De Veil . Can you prove I put any thing into the News ? Court . Do not interrupt the Evidence , this only tends to confound us . Council . I would ask Colonel De Veil whether he has ever given this Man any Directions with respect to the Prisoners that are committed to his Charge before this happened ? Colonel De Veil . I sent for him twice to let him know the Complaints that were made against him for putting People into that Hole , who were not Felons ; for I always apprehended that Place was only fit for People who were refractory , and for Felons , I only thought it fit for such People : - He never sent me Word of any Bodies being dead in his Round-House : I had examined thirteen People before I knew any thing of the Matter , and when I knew how they were I discharged them immediately ; and I did not know but some of the People who were in my Yard might have died there ; I believe it was about twelve o'Clock . Bird . Do not go to save your Reputation at the Expence of my Life , but be upon Honour . Colonel De Veil . I had sent out a Warrant ; the Warrant was to be returned at eight o'Clock in the Morning . I examined thirteen Prisoners before I knew of any Thing that had happened in the Round-House . Q . How long may it be from the Time of your giving him those Directions and this thing happening ? Colonel De Veil . It might be half a Year between the Time of my giving him that Caution and this thing happening ? Bird . My Lord , I am very unhappy in having my Papers destroyed : I was in hopes I should have found them : I do acknowledge I had two Summons 's from him , one of them was to know why I discharged two Persons , without Orders from him , for cursing the King ; and the other to know why I did not quarter two Soldiers , when I never had any Licence . Court . You hear what he says , is it so ? Colonel De Veil . Upon my Oath I sent for him twice to check him for that very Thing I have mentioned : I do not know whether it was by written Summons 's , or whether I sent for him by a Message . Bird . If he had sent for me I should out of Complaisance have gone , for I never was afraid of any Thing . Court . They have gone through the Evidence for the Prosecution , and now it is your turn to offer what you have to say in your Defence ; do not hurry yourself , and I hope every one that is within hearing will consider a Man , that stands upon Trial for his Life , and I should be injurious to the Person who is the Prisoner at the Bar , if I should not turn every Body out of Court who will not be silent . Bird . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury ; I am the Person who is so unhappy as to be indicted here for Murder ; I had but seven Witnesses , one of which is in the Hospital , in a Salivation ; and Bushel , who is the principal , has sworn himself out of it . [ Elizabeth Beaumont sworn . ] Q . Where you carried to the Round-House that Night the Women were confined there , and some of them died ? Beaumont . Yes , I was carried there about half an Hour after eleven o'Clock at Night . Q . Where were you put when you first came in ? Beaumont . Into the Drinking-Room ? Q . How long did you stay in the Drinking-room ? Beaumont . Till five o'Clock in the Morning . Q . What came of you afterwards ? Beaumont . Those that were in the Drinking-Room were all put down . Q . Who were in the Drinking-Room ? Beaumont . I can not justly tell , but the Constable and the Beadle insisted upon putting them all down before they left the House , and they were all put into the Hole , but I was not : Mr. Bird went down to put them in , and I followed him down in order to go in ; and he pushed me up again , saying , What Business have you here , I have more than I know what to do with or can shut in ; and he came up and left the Door of the Hole open : He said he would not have them stifled under him ; for he would not shut the Door ; there were five or six came up with me . Q . How came the rest not to come up ? Beaumont . I can not tell ; Mr. Bird said he could not shut them in ; and he said , leave the Door open , and let them be upon the Stairs all Night to give them Room : The Constable of the Night , and the Beadle , insisted on having the House cleared before they went to Bed ; or else they said there would be nothing all Night but drinking Gin and smoaking Tobacco : The Constable of the Night , and the Beadle , came up again and said to Mr. Bird , Damn you , I have shut them in , why could not you ? Mr. Bird insisted on having the top Door shut , and the under one left open , and said , they could not break through an Iron Door and Stone Walls . I paid for a Bed and went up , and Mr. Bird and his Wife came up and laid down till about nine o'Clock , when they opened the Door . Q . From the Time of your coming in , did you hear any cry of Fire , or Murder , or Water , or any cry whatsoever ? Beaumont . I did not hear any - about three o'Clock in the Morning , the People above asked for some Water , and had some brought them ; I heard none below call for Water . Q . Where was you ? Beaumont . I was in the upper Room . Bird . There were none put down till they were forced by the Constable and Beadle , for I would have had them all have staid above ; pray ask her , as to the Liquor that was sold that Night , whether there was any till it was at their own request ; and that was sent for from a Night-House . Beaumont . Several Gallons of Beer were sent for , but I do not know from whence it came , but there was no other Liquor . Bird . Where did I sit ? Beaumont . He sat next to the Constable of the Night . Bird . Did I oblige any People to send for Liquor ? Beaumont . No , Mr. Bird said he did not desire them to send for any . Jury . Did you pay any Money to Mr. Bird for staying above , and having the Use of the upper Room ? Beaumont . No , I had no Money . Jury . Did you promise any ? Beaumont . No , I did not . Q . Did you go into Bed ? Beaumont . No , I did not go into Bed . [ On the cross Examination . ] Q . How came it that you had this Liberty more than any Body else ? Beaumont . There were several Gentlemen above Stairs , who were Officers of the Parish , that desired I might not go down into the Hole . Q . Were there any that desired to be kept above Stairs ? Beaumont . No , I did not hear any . [ Mrs. Amey was going to speak ; says Bird , Pray , Mrs. Amey hold your Tongue , I shall show your Character by and by . ] Q . Was Busbel there . Beaumont . Busbel was there , but he was very drunk . Q . Are you sure the Constable of the Night and the Beadle went down with the Prisoners ? Beaumont . Yes , I am . Q . What Time was that ? Beaumont . It was about 5 o'Clock , and they went away immediately . Q . Who made use of that Expression , Why could not you do it as well as I ? Beaumont . It was the Constable of the Night , or the Beadle , and not Mr. Bird . Q. Mr. Bushel , do you remember this Woman 's being there ? Bushel . She was not there when the Constable of the Night went away ; she was gone to Bed : She was not down at five o'Clock . Jury . Mr. Bushel , were you not in Liquor ? - Bushel . I was as sober as I am now . Q . How near was the Room she went to Bed in , to that you were in ? Bushel . It was up one pair of Stairs . - I went down a little before they were put down into the Hole ; and I told him , I could not put them in . The Constable went down three or four Steps , and Bird went before him ; I saw the Constable upon the Stairs all the Time , he went no farther I am sure of it . Q. I want to know for what Purpose he went down ; whether it was to have the House cleared , or what it was for ? Bushel . I believe he went to have them put in . Bird . Did not Amey knock the Candle out of my Hand ? Beaumont . I did not see any Thing of that : I did hear of the Candle 's being put out , but I can not tell who did it ; but the Candle did go out . Bird . There was no Occasion for another Candle to be brought , if the Candle I had was not out : The Candle was out , and another brought down : You saw that ? Beaumont . I saw the Candle was out , and there was another brought down . Mr. Bird was almost dead among them wi th the Heat and stirring about . Bird . 'T is very odd the High-Constable should not come to have let me known what I must do with People . Council . You say you went up Stairs again with five or six People : Where was Bird then ? Beaumont . Bird followed me close up Stairs . Q . How came the Constable and Beadle to be so favourable to you , as to let you go up , when they put the others down ? Beaumont . The others did not desire any such Thing . - Those five or six that came up desired to be in the Drinking-Room all Night . Q . You said before , you desired a Bed , and said you would pay for it , and that was the Reason you were not turned down . Beaumont . I do not remember that I said any such Thing . Q . If you did not offer to pay for a Bed any more than the rest , how came that Distinction to be made ? Beaumont . There were some Gentlemen drinking there that desired it . Mary Hammond was brought in with me , but was not put into the Hole . Q . When he first went down , did he open the Hole-Door ? Beaumont . Yes . Q . How long was it before the Candle was brought again ? Beaumont . Three or four Minutes . Q . Was the Door open when the Candle came back ? Beaumont . He stood with the Door in his Hand , and shut the Door when the Candle came down . Q . Did any of these poor Wretches come out when he opened the Door ? Beaumont . I can not say that any of them did . Council . You said before , he left the Door of the Hole unlock 'd . Beaumont . He said he would shut the Stairs-door , and leave the other Door open ; but I can not tell whether he did or not . There was such a Mob about the Window , that Bird 's Son came down and told his Father , that they would not have Air ; and Mr. Bushel was sent to beat them away . Council . Why you say , he [ Bushel ] was drunk . Beaumont . Yes , so he was . Court . When the Candle was brought down , could you see how many People there were in the Hole ? Beaumont . No , I could not . Henry Harris . I am a Watchman in the Strand . On the 15th of July I carried a Woman to the Round-House-Door , for making a Riot in the Street , and Mr. Bird refused to take her in , beause he had too many already ; this was between three and four o'Clock . Q . How long have you known him in this Office ? Harris . I have been a Watchman 12 Months , and have known him all that Time . Q . Have you heard any Persons give him an ill Character , as a cruel Man ? Harris . No , none but the Women of the Street , and they will speak any thing . Michael Hayes . I am a Watchman , I went along with Harris , and when we came to the Watch-house Door , Mr. Bird refused to take any more in , for that he had more than he knew what to do with . Council . So he took who he would , and refused who he would . Bird . No , Mr. Stracy , No , no . Thomas Warrington . The sixteenth of July between three and four in the Morning , I brought a Man down to the Round-House , for breaking of Windows , and the Constable and Mr. Busbel discharged him . Q . How did the Constable and Mr. Busbel behave on this Occasion . Warrington . They behaved very well for what I could see . Q . Did you apprehend Bushel to be drunk or sober ? Warrington . I am not a Judge whether he was or was not . Bird . Answer the Question , do you think he was in Liquor or not ? Warrington . I can not say whether he was or not . I staid there about half an Hour . Bird . What Part did I act at that Time ? Warrington . He sat behind the Table : I do not remember what he said . Bird . Did I oppose the Man 's being discharged , or any ways intermeddle ? Warrington . I can not say any Thing to that , but he did not get off his Seat . [ John Tilton sworn . ] Bird . Please to examine him , my Lord , what Time of the Night he came , and what Time he went away . Q . What are you ? Tilton . I am principal Watchman of the Parish of St. Martin 's . Q . What Time did you come to the Round-House , on the 15th or 16th of July ? Tilton . Between ten and eleven o'Clock , the 15th of July , at Night , and staid till five o'Clock in the Morning . Q . In what Manner did Bird behave during that Time ? Tilton . I did not see any thing amiss in his Behaviour , the Prisoners were brought in pretty fast , and he ordered them down into the Hole . Bird . Ask him whether I went from behind the Table , for I sat at the Table with the Constable to take the Names of the Prisoners down . Tilton . He was on the other Side of the Table setting the Prisoners Names down ; there being so many Prisoners they were ordered down into the Hole , for we could not keep them in the Room . - He did come from behind the Table two or there Times to order the Prisoners into the Hole . Q . Did he go into the Hole ? Tilton . I do not know whether he went into the Hole , till between four or five in the Morning . Court . Who went down to put the Prisoners in , and said , he could not put them in ; was it the Prisoner or Bushel ? Tilton . It was Busbel ; he was ordered by Bird . Q . What was the Expression Bushel made use of when he came up from the Hole ? Tilton . He said there were so many there already , that he could not put any more in ; and the Prisoner afterwards said to Bushel , you could not put them in , but I have put them in , in a Minute . Q . Did you look upon Bushel to be sober ? Tilton . I believe we were all sober , I saw none of us drunk . Court . How has he behaved in general to the Prisoners , has he behaved handsomely , or with Cruelty ? Tilton . He always behaved well to them , I have seen him dress them when they came in wounded , and with their Heads broke : And he always endeavoured to make Peace among them , when they have quarrelled . Q . Did he always use them gently ; or was he some Times rigorous ? Tilton . Sometimes one Way , and sometimes another . Council . What Reason did Busbel give , when he said there was so many in the Hole , that he could not put any more in ? Tilton . He said they would be stifled , if there were more put in , and he would put no more in ; and Bird went down and put them in . Bird . Do you think I would have put these three Persons down , if I thought there had not been room for them ? Whether I would have put them in , if I had thought to have murdered or destroyed three or four People . Tilton . I believe he would not have put them in designedly to destroy them . Q . Was any thing said by Busbel of giving them more Room ? Tilton . Yes , he said if the Door of the Hole was opened for them to come to the Stairs , there would be more Air ; and Bird said , if they were let out , they would let the Men out : The Door at the Head is a single Leaf . Q . Has he the Character of a Person that uses the People kindly or harshly ? Tilton . He does use them a little cruelly sometimes . Bird . In what Respect do you mean I use them cruelly ? Whether with a Broomstick , or what ? Tilton . Why with his Tongue , my Lord . Bird . Do not you reckon that it is the Duty of the Beadle , and the Constable of the Night , to put these People there ? Tilton . You had no Occasion to do that , for you took that Business out of our Hands . Bird . I have not any Business with any of the Prisoners , only with the Constable , to attend him and the Watchmen . Q. Tilton , When he put these People down , was it by the Direction of the Constable , or did he do it of his own Head ? Tilton . He did it of his own Head : The Constable ca n't read or write , he knew nothing of the Search . [ Paul Broadbent sworn . ] Bird . Did I not do what I could for the Relief of the Prisoners when the Door was opened ? Broadbent . He said there were People very ill , and he desired me to go down : This was after I had been with some Prisoners to Colonel De Veil 's . When I saw what a Condition they were in , I spoke to a Person to bleed them . Bird . Did not I send you for Coclough and Frasbury 's young Man ; and sent you for Spirits , thinking they were fainting ; not imagining this would be their Deaths . Broadbent . He got Drops to revive them , as soon as well could be , and sent me to Coclough and Perkins . Q . How many died in the Hole . Broadbent . There were four died in the Hole ; one was quite dead when I went down , and three more died in half an Hour , or three quarters of an Hour ; there were six in the Hole then : All the four that died were blooded , as well as those two that lived . Q . What Condition was the Room in ; was it not difficult to breathe in ? Broadbent . It was nauseous with the Sweat of the People . Edmund Thomas . I am one of the Overseers of the Poor . July 16 , about eleven o'Clock he told me , he had had a confused Night of it ; for the High-Constable had been out with a Search-Warrant , and he had a great Number of Prisoners ; and he said some of them were so very ill , that he was afraid they were near expiring , and desired an Order for the Chair of the Work-house : He did not say any of them were expired . Bird . How did I behave while you was Constable ? E. Thomas . I served the Office in 1740 and 1741 , and during my Year he behaved with Humanity . Q. I ask you , Sir , whether that is his general Character , his dealing humanely with his Prisoners ? E. Thomas . He is a hasty hot Man . [ Samuel Attershall , Governor of Bridewell , sworn . ] Attershall . I have seen him five or six Times ; he has brought Prisoners to our House . I know nothing of his Character in this Point . Bird . He is but young in the Place . John Horseman , the Turnkey and Hemp-Dresser . He has brought Prisoners to our House , and ordered Beds for them . Jonas Gray . I was Constable about three Years ago . I never knew any harm of him ; he was apt to quarrel with his Wife sometimes , and then I would bid him go up Stairs , for I reckoned that House mine . - He behaved well to the Prisoners all my Year , - He treated them with Humanity , and oftentimes gave them Victuals and Drink . Q . Had you ever 20 Prisoners in that Place at one Time ? Gray . I have had nineteen there at one Time , and kept them there four or five Hours . - The Dean and Chapter of Westminster had ordered all the Beggars to be taken up , and they were put in there . - It was in the hard Frost , and they had strong Beer , Bread and Cheese , and Air . - I would not have kept them there without Refreshment , but I think the Constable ought to send them to the Gate-house , or some other Prison . Q . Did you see any Person in a white Gown ? Gray . I do not know . I think all their Cloaths were hardly worth 5 s. and I think really they were stifled with drinking of Liquors . Lewis Quondrean . I have been Constable almost twelve Months . Now and then , when the Prisoner was a little in Liquor , he would make a Noise : but to force his Liquor upon People he never did in my Time , nor trouble himself whether they spent any Money or no . Bird . Sir John , as you are my Council , I desire to know whether it is necessary to send for the Constable of the Night ? Sir John Strange . I shall take Care of all legal Advantages for you . You may send for him if you will . Joseph Akins . I was Constable of the Night , when this Accident happened . I went there about eleven o'Clock , and continued there till between four and five in the Morning . I was in the Chair above Stairs all the Time . Q . Did you write down the Names of the Prisoners ? Akins . I can not write . Q . Did you employ any Body to do it for you ? Akins . I employed none , nor asked none . Bird wrote some of them , I do not know whether he wrote them all or no ; he was writing before I came in . Q . How long was it before you went away , that Bird went down into the Hole ? Akins . I do not know any thing of his going quite down into the Hole . Q . Is it usual to have the House cleared before you go away ? Akins . It is just as he likes his Customers . Q . You went down into the Hole , What did you go down for ? Akins . When I was going away , I went down two or three Steps into the Hole , with my Staff in my Hand . Q . For what Purpose did you go down that Step or two ? Jury . My Lord , he seems to be afraid of charging himself . Q . What Business had you to stand with your Staff there , when the Prisoner went into the Hole . [ The Witness made no Answer . ] Q . Did you stand at the Top of the Stairs before you left the Round-House , to see the Prisoners confined in the Hole ? Akins . The Prisoners were nothing at all to me ; I put none down into the Hole . Q . Do you know of the Beadle 's going down with any ? Akins . No : Neither of his going down , or coming up . - Court . Speak the Truth , there is no body will ask you any Questions to charge yourself . Q . Did you see the Beadle go down with any People ? Akins . No , I did not see him go down . Mr. Bushel the Beadle said , There was not Room enough . I can not say whether Bird went down to the Bottom or no . - He said he had done what Bushel could not do . Jury . As you was there all Night , did you see any ill Usage from Bird to the Prisoners ? Akins . I did not see any Thing of any Misbehaviour . - He behaved very well . - I never saw him soberer in my Life . - I believe Bushel was sober . Q . Sir , answer the Question that was put to you , What you stood on the Stairs , going down into the Hole , with your Staff in your Hand for ? Akins . Why , it was to see whether what Bushel said could not be done , could be done . Jury . Did you hear the Cries of the Women in the Hole ? Akins . No , I did not hear any ; there was Singing either among the Men or Women , but which I can not tell : We had more Noise above to drown that below . - I did not see any Gin , or any strong Liquors carried down . John Howard . I have known the Prisoner almost ever since he was born : I have employed him in writing , and always took him to be a good natured Man , but he is hasty and passionate ; - but not cruel or ill-natured . Ann Mables . I have known him nine Years . When I heard of this Accident , I never was so shocked in my Life ; for I always knew him to be a good-natur 'd Man , and never knew him to be guilty of a cruel Action . Ann Catherine Bret , Widow of the late Governor of Bridewell . I have known him three Quarters of a Year , and he always behaved handsomely to the Prisoners , when he has brought any to our House - and sometimes gave them Money . German Merchant . I have known him ten Years ; and he has been often benevolent to the Prisoners , and used them well . John Ellis . I have known him near twenty Years , and his Father before him ; I never heard any Thing amiss of him . Mark Coney . I have known the Prisoner four Years . I never saw any Thing but that his Temper was very well . I served Constable last Year , he behaved very well , unless he was a little in Liquor , and then I used to bid him go out of the House . - He behaved very well to the Prisoners . Mark Hodgson . I have known him three Years . I served the Office of Constable last Year , and his Behaviour was always very civil to the Prisoners , and he has given distressed Prisoners Money to relieve them . The Evidence being gone through , it was observed by the Court , on Behalf of the Prisoner , that the first Part of the Charge , viz . his forcing , putting , and placing her in this Hole , was so far from being prov 'd , that the contrary appear 'd on Evidence ; and they doubted , whether it being so laid , it was not become necessary to be proved . It was said on the Part of the Crown , that if in the first Instance she was not forced , yet from the Time she cried out for Relief , and desired they might be thinned or let out , the continuing her there was a forcible Consinement ; and the continuing her there , knowing the Danger she was in , may make that a Force upon her , ab initio : but that as this particular Fact need not have been laid , there is no Necessity to prove it . For this purpose was cited 2 Hawkins , Chap . 46 . Sect . 41 . Also Mackalley 's Case , in killing a Serjeant in London , on a Special Verdict found at the Old Bailey , December 5 , 1610 , which was said to be a Case in Point . [ The first Exception to which Verdict was , that there was a material Variance betwixt the Indictment and the Verdict , for the Indictment supposed that the Sheriff had made a Precept to the Serjeant at Mace to arrest the Defendant , and by the Verdict it appeared that there was not any such Precept made , so that the Indictment being Special , to make that Offence Murder by Construction of Law upon the Special Matter without any Malice prepense , ought to be pursued , and proved in Evidence , which was not done in that Case , for the Jury did not find the said Special Matter , but the contrary ; and because the Jurors had not found the Special Matter contained in the Indictment , but other Matter , Judgment could not be given against the Prisoner upon that Indictment . To which it was answered , and in the End resolv 'd by all the Judges of England , that there was sufficient Matter contained in the Indictment , upon which the Court ought to give Judgment of Death against the Prisoner , notwithstanding the said Variance . And he was executed , 9 Rep. 62 - 70 . ] Upon the Whole , the Jury found the Verdict Special to the following Effect , viz . We find that William Bird , the Person indicted , on the 15th and 16th of July last , was Keeper of St Martin 's Round-House in Middlesex . And that Mary , the Wife of John Maurice , in the Indictment named , was duly committed on the same 16th of July , to the said Keeper , to be there kept in safe Custody . And we further find , that while the said Mary Maurice was in Custody of the said Keeper as aforesaid , one Sarah Bland , who was then also in the Custody of the said William Bird , as Keeper aforesaid , was on the same 16th Day of July , about the Hour of two in the Morning of the same Day , forced , put , and placed , by the said William Bird , in a certain close Room , called the Hole , then being Part of the Building , called St Martin 's Round-House . And we further find , that the said Mary Maurice then desired the said William Bird , that she might go down into the said Hole along with the said Sarah Bland ; and that she did accordingly go with the said Sarah Bland into the said Hole . And we further find , that the said Mary Maurice , soon after she was in the said Hole , as aforesaid , did request the said William Bird to be released out of the said Hole . But we further find , that on the same 16th Day of July , the said . William Bird , notwithstanding such Request of the said Mary Maurice , to be released out of the said close Room , called the Hole , as aforesaid , did continue and confine the said Mary Maurice , being so in the Hole as aforesaid , for the Space of two Hours , against the Will and Consent of her the said Mary Maurice , during all which Time there were twenty other Persons confined as Prisoners by the said William Bird , in the same close Room , as in the said Indictment is alledged . And we further find , that the said close Room , during the Time aforesaid , was not of sufficient Largeness to confine twenty Persons therein , for the Space of one Hour , without manifest Danger of their Lives , as in the said indictment is also alledged . And we further find , that by Reason of the said continuing and confining her the said Mary , by the said William Bird , in Form aforesaid , in the said close Room , she , the said Mary , during the said Time of her Confinement as aforesaid , viz . on the said 16th Day of July in the close Room aforesaid , was suffocated , and that she there died , during the Time of her said Confinement , of such Suffocation , as in the said Indictment is also alledged . But we find that the said William Bird did not force , put , or place the said Mary Maurice , into the said close Room , called the Hole , as in the said Indictment is also alledged : We find all other Matters and Circumstances necessary for bringing the Point in Issue before the Court ; But whether the said William Bird is guilty of the Felony and Murder in the said Indictment supposed , we know not . But if upon the Whole , & c. * * William Bird was likewise arraigned on an Indictment , for the Murder of Phillis Wells , Spinster . And also on another Indictment , for the Murder of Ann Branch , Spinster ; both which Trials were put off to the next Sessions . 103. Jane Wood was indicted for stealing 13 Guineas , and 7 Shillings in Money , in the Dwelling-house of Samuel Windsor , and his Property , September the 4th . Samuel Windsor . I lost a Sum of Money out of my Drawer last Saturday in the Afternoon ; about 10 Guineas , how much more I can not say : The Money was in a Drawer , in the one Pair of Stairs Room backward . I did not miss it till five o'Clock on Monday Morning . I live at the George in Broad St Giles 's : The Prisoner used to come to my House to play with a Child of mine ; there was no Body up Stairs that Day but that Girl ; and she owned to the Constable , in my Presence , that she took eight Guineas and some Silver out of my Drawer , on Saturday in the Afternoon , and that she took five Guineas from me two or three Months before ; which Money I missed , but did not know she took it Q . Did you give her any Hopes or Promise of Favour if she would confess ? Samuel Windsor . I told her if she would tell me of any Body that were her Accomplices , I would be as favourable as ever I could ; she said she had no Accomplice , but that she gave her Mother one half Guinea of it to pay her Rent ; and had seven Guineas of it in her Box : Colonel De Veil ordered the Constable to go with me and the Girl , which I did ; she unlock 'd the Box , and took out six Guineas , and gave them into my Hand ; I deliver 'd them to Colonel De Veil , she owned these were my Guineas ; she gave me a Pair of Buckles , and a Pair of Ear-rings , and said she had bought them with the five Guineas she took from me before , and delivered up some Clothes . John Harris , the Constable that served the Warrant . She told me she took eight Guineas and some Silver out of the Drawers , that she found the Keys on the Drawers ; and laid them there again . Windsor . I did not know any Harm of the Girl before now . John Hastings . I have known the Prisoner from an Infant , and never knew any Harm of her ; she is very ignorant , but was always reputed an honest , Girl : She was frightened into Fits some Years ago , by some Soldiers coming into the House , which took away her Senses ; I got her into the Infirmary at Westminster , and she was sometime there before she was cured : I am a Gold-smith at Charing-Cross , her Father worked for me , and she used to bring things backward and forward , and I never found her dishonest .

Henry Messenger deposed : That he was on Board the Ship called the Blessing , August the second , at Ratcliff Cross , in the Port of London , about eleven at Night , he saw a Boat come along Side the Vessel , which gave him a Suspicion that something was to be done , and laid his Hand upon Half an Ancher of Brandy ; and then another ; that he seized them , and no Man obstructed him . A Man came and struck him on the Shoulder , or pushed him violently , and struck him Head-foremost down the Ladder into the Stearage , followed him and beat him , and struck him several Blows ; and he took half an Anchor and run away with it ; that John Morell the Prisoner beat him , and said he was Captain of the Ship ; that he [ Morell ] was Boatswain of the Ship , Blessing ; that the Sailors must know him to be an Officer , because they call them Partners , but he did not know whether Morell was present when the Custom-house-Officers came on Board ; that he is sure this is the Man that abused and assaulted him , and that he must know him to be an Officer , because he had suffered him to carry some little Things on Shore . William Walls deposed : That he was a Tidesman on Board the Ship , Blessing : That he saw his Partner , Messenger , fall Neck and Heels down the Steerage , and saw a Man follow him , and saw him strike Messenger two or three Blows . That his Partner , Messenger , call 'd out , What will you stay and see me murdered ; and that then he turned out as fast as he could . That when he came into the Forecastle , he laid his Hands upon a Man 's Legs or Thighs , and asked him , What Business he had there ? He said , Damn your Blood , I am Captain of the Ship , What Business have you with me ? That he ( Watts ) said to him , be you the Devil , I will hold you if I can ; that he said to his Partner , Messenger , here 's one of them . That then his Partner came to his Assistance ; that before he came , he struck him three or four Blows on the Belly . That John Morell , the Prisoner at the Bar , is the Man . That they had no Occasion to declare they were Officers , for all the Ship 's Company knew it . That Morell was Boatswain of the Ship , and came up from Gravesend with them . That they never show them their Deputations - That there was another Man came into the Forecastle with a Handspike , and struck at Messenger , and then they cried out Murder , and had Assistance from other Ships ; three from one Ship , and one from another . Jonathan Bonner deposed : That hearing a Cry of Murder on Board the Ship , Blessing , they went on board her off the Forecastle into the Windlace , and from thence to the Main Deck ; and before the Windlace they found Messenger had hold of the Prisoner at the Bar , and that Messenger kept his hold , till he , Bonner , laid hold of him , with the Assistance of the Rest of the Officers , and they carried him into the Cabbin , and continued with him all Night , and the next Day , till he was brought before Justice Dennet ; and that the Prisoner at the Bar is the very Man : And that it can be no Secret to the Sailors that they are Officers when they go on Board , for they are always called by the Name of Partners . Jonathan Crockson , another Officer , deposed to the same Effect . But the Jury , thinking it was incumbent upon them to prove , that they had informed the Prisoner that they were Officers , ( which they had not ) he was acquitted .
