Last Saturday was Seven-night , between 7 and 8 in the Morning , Mary Elizabeth Homls came to me in Leadenhall-Market , and said , What Money have you got in your Pocket ? Why , 17 s. and 6 d. says I . But pray look , says she , and so I did ; but I could not find one single brass Farthing , for my Money was all gone . Well , says she , come along with me , and I 'll shew the Woman that took it ; and so she brought me to the Prisoner , and laid hold on her . The Prisoner had got the Money in her Hand , and went to put it into my Pocket again ; but Holms would not let her , though I would fain have had my Money again . Court . Was it your own Money ? Peterson . It was Money that I had borrow 'd to go to Market with , there were 4 half Crowns , and the rest in Shillings and Six-pences ; and so Mrs. Holms brought her before Mr. Basset the Constable , and put the Money into his Hands , and then we went before Sir Richard Brocas , and the Prisoner did not deny that she took the Money . Prisoner . Did not Holms say to you , that if you did not prosecute me , she would prosecute you ? Peterson . Well , I know she did , but what Business had you to rob me ? Tell me that . Mary Elizabeth Holms . As I was sitting at the Rose and Crown Door in the Market , I saw the Prisoner hassle up to the Prosecutor and pick her Pocket , so I goes to the Prosecutor , and old Gentlewoman , says I , what Money have ye got ?

But I Bitch 'd up the Prisoner again pretty handsomely , and brought her to the Constable ; I had watch 'd her several Days , because I thought she was a Pick pocket ; and , I said , that the first time I catch 'd her , I would have her prosecuted , or else I would prosecute them that made it up . A couple of Men came to me to Day , and they said they came from the Prisoner , and they offer 'd me ten Guineas not to appear against her . Prisoner .

On the 14th of this Month , about 5 in the Evening , I put up my Cows in my own Field , and about 7 the same Night , the Prisoner was taken driving them along the Road . James Pye . Between 7 and 8 at Night I saw the Prisoner and another Boy going by my Door with 2 Cows : Says I to Harry White , This is a Green-yard Business . And say Harry White , I 'll run and stop 'em , and so he did . I took the Prisoner , and he said the other Boy who ran away ) gave him Six-pence to drive 'em to the Green-yard . We went to the Justice 's House , but he was not at Home , so that we waited for him at an Ale-house till 2 o'Clock in the Morning . The Boy then own 'd that he took 3 Cows from the Common , but that one of them got away at Kingsland-Road ; and that the Keeper of the Green-yard gave him Money for driving one Mr. Gran 's Horse-thither Thomas Barton , again The Cow that got from the Boy came Home again The Day before I lost these Cows . I had 2 Horses taken away in the same Manner , and conveyed to the Green-yard , where they made me pay 6 s. 8 d. for one Night , before they would let me have them again . When the Boy was taken , I desir 'd the Woman of the Green-yar to go with me , to see if he was the same Boy that brought my Horses to her , but she would not go , tho ' I offer 'd her a Coach . Not only I , but all my Neighbours round me have had their Cows or Horses carried to the Green-yard in this manner , which has been a great Charge to us ; for we are forced to pay extravagantly to get them out again . The Owner of the Green-yard gives a Shilling a-piece to any Body that brings Beasts thither , which is a great Encouragement for these Vagabonds to take them out of our Fields , or off the Common . It not being done with a felonious Intent , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner 12 , 13. Margaret Foy and Mary Carrol , of Covent-Garden , were indicted for privately stealing ( with Mary Smith , not yet taken ) 14 pair of worsted Stockings , Value 47 s. the Goods of Joseph Setree , in his Shop , Jan 3 . The Prisoners came together into Mr. Setree 's Shop in Russel-street , and Carrol asked for some fine Holland , and he open 'd several Counters , but none pleas 'd her Foy was then standing by the Window , where several Papers of Stockings lay ; she had a Ridinghood on , and her Coats were tuck 'd up . Smith came in , and passed by the Prisoners without taking any Notice of them , and ask 'd for some Scotch-Cloth to line the Body of a Gown for her Mistress : She went to the farther End of the Shop , and said she was in great haste , and then Carrol was in haste too : He endeavour 'd to please them both , but they both were very difficult . While he was engaged with them , a Neighbour 's Son came in to change a Guinea ; he went in for Silver , and as he came out again , he saw Foy was bustling about the Counter , but did not then suspect any thing . Carrol bought half a Yard of Irish-Linen , for which she paid 19 d 1/2 , but she borrow 'd the Money of Foy ; and while Foy put her Hand in her Pocket for the Money , he observed that she had 2 large Linen Bags , or Pockets , within side her Riding-hood . Then Smith would have some of the same Linen as Carrol had , for which she paid 21 l. The Prisoners went first , and Smith follow 'd . Soon after they were gone he missed the Stockings , and went to enquire after his Customers ; for he had seen them before , and heard they lived in the Neighbourhood . He was told that Smith was a Servant to a Gentlewoman that lodged at the Green Canister in Princes-street . He went thither , but could not meet with her ; but there he got Intelligence that Carrol was a Servant to Mrs. Mason , at Mr. Hosse 's , a Barber , in Russel-street . By good Luck he found them all three standing at Mr. Hesse 's Door . Pray , Mistress , says he to Foy , was not you at my Shop just now ? I , at your Shop . Fellow , says she , what do you mean ? I never was at your Shop in my Life , nor do n't know where it stands . However , he secured them , and brought Foy back to his Shop in order to search her . In pulling off her Ridinghood , two odd Stockings were some how thrown behind the Counter . Smith pretended that she did not know Foy ; but Foy and Carrol were drinking hot Pots together that Afternoon , Up-stairs , at the Golden-Lyon in Russel-street , and ordered themselves to be denied to every Body but Smith , who came in a little time , and was sent up to them . Smith left them a little while , and went to - Bowen , a Pawnbroker 's , and pawn 'd for Half-a-Crown the two Pieces of Cloth they had bought of the Prosecutor just before . Mr. Hosse ( to whose Lodger Carrol was a Servant ) going Up-stairs , found 2 odd Stockings hung between the Banisters , which proved to be the fellows to the 2 that were found behind the Prosecutor 's Counter when Foy was searched . In the Cellar Mr. Hosse found a Handkerchief under the Water-Tub , with several Pair of Stockings in it , which were part of those the Prosecutor lost . Smith was made an Evidence [ out did not appear against the Prisoners on their Trail ] Foy broke out of the Round house , but Mr. White , the Constable , met her afterwards in Leadenhall-street , and secured her . She offer 'd him 5 or 10 Guineas to let her go , and would have given as much to have made it up with the Prosecutor ; but after she was sent to Newgate , she said , if they had taken the Money , she would have prosecuted them for compounding a Felony . At Mr. White 's House ( the King's-Arms Tavern in Russel-Street ) Carrol fell on her Knees to the Prosecutor , and said , that her Life was in his Hand , that his Goods had been lost , and she would make him Satisfaction . And when she was in the Coach with Mr. White , who had her in Charge , she said to him , dear Honey White , my Life is in your Power , you may hang me , or save me . The Defence of the Prisoners . Foy said , That she spoke to Smith , when Smith came by her in the Prosecutor 's Shop , and that after she heard Smith had sworn against her , she was coming to surrender herself , in order to take her Tryal , when Mr. White seiz 'd her in Leadenhall-Street . Carrol said , That the Prosecutor knew her before , she having been at his Shop to buy facing and robing for a Gown , and that she told him where she liv 'd in the Neighbourhood , and that therefore it was very unlikely she should go to his Shop with a Design to steal . The Jury acquitted Carrol , and found Foy Guilty to the value of 4 s. 10 d. 13 . Margaret Foy was a second time indicted for privately stealing 3 Pair of Silk Stockings , value 36 s. the Goods of William Munyard , in his Shop , the 20th of Dec . last ; but the Jury acquitted her .

John Sharp , of Cripplegate , was indicted for privately stealing 16 Pair of Girls Kid-Gloves , value 15 s. the Goods of Edward Edwards , in his Shop , the 8th of this Instant February . While the Prosecutor was busy in the back Part of his Shop , between 7 and 8 at Night , the Prisoner came in , and reaching over the Counter took the Gloves , and run away ; he was observed by Edward Nicholas , an opposite Neighbour , who pursu 'd and took him . The Jury found him Guilty to the value of 4s . 10d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 16. Joseph Starkey , of St. Bartholomew , near the Royal-Exchange , was indicted for stealing a Pewter Gallon Pot , value 4 s. the Goods of John Rutty , the 5th of this Instant February . As the Prosecutor 's Servant was sitting on the Stairs Head , he saw the Prisoner as he was going through the Tavern ( it being a thorow Fare ) take the Pot which stood on a Table ; he follow 'd and seiz 'd him . The Jury found him Guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 17. John Broadby , of Aldgate , was indicted for privately stealing 15 Firkins of Butter , value 10 l. the Goods of Christian Colebrant and Ralph Myer , in their Warehouse , the 21st of January last . Daniel Lightfoot . My Master is a Smith , he did work for Mr. Colebrant the Sugar-Baker , and so I became acquainted with the Prisoner , who is Mr. Colebrant 's Coachman . The Butter was in a Warehouse over Mr. Colebrant 's Stables ; the Prisoner took it from thence , and deliver 'd it to me to sell for him , which I did for 9 s. a Firkin to several Tallow-Chandlers ; I sold 8 Firkins to Carter ( he that sells Candles so cheap ) at the Half-Moon in Spittle-Fields ; 3 Firkins to the Tallow-Chandler , at the Crown over-against Carter 's , and 4 to Thomas Rivet , in Windford-Street . Prisoner . Did not you swear before the Justice that you had this Butter from a Carman ? Lightfoot . Yes , I did so . But ah ! you threatened my Life if I swore it against you . Samuel Isaac , Carter 's Boy . Lightfoot brought some Firkins to our House , and my Master bought them of him . Mr. Colebrant . We lost Butter 3 or 4 times while the Prisoner lived with me , which was about 11 Months , but he constantly deny 'd it , and I ca n't say but that he behaved very well in my Service . Tho Armstrong . Lightfoot was my Prentice , he was not so good as he should have been , for he has wronged me several times . Two or three Gentlemen gave the Prisoner a very good Character ; and the Jury acquitted him . 18. John Tapper of Aldgate , was indicted for the Murder of Joseph Cannon , by giving him with a Knife one Mortal Wound in the Body near the Right-pap , of the Breadth of half an Inch , and Depth of three Inches , the 11th of January last , of which he languished till the 22d of the same Month , and then died . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Joseph Rohan . You must know that Tapper the Prisoner , and Cannon the Deceas 'd , both lodged at Cannon 's Mother in-Law 's , and she keeps a Chandler's-shop in Gravel-Lane in Hounsditch ; and so I happen 'd to go thither about Noon , the 11th of January last , to buy some Chandler 's Ware , as usual . Council . What Company did you see there ? Rohan . There was Cannon and his Wife , and her Mother ; and Tapper and my Wife Jonny ; and - let me see - Smith and Cotterl , and Wilcox . Now Wilcox and the Deceas 'd were playing at Cards together , and Wilcox won all his Money . Then the Deceas 'd pull 'd off his Waistcoat to send it to pawn for 2 s. but his Wife said to him , You had better buy me a Smock to my Back ; at which he fell into a Passion , and got up to beat her . She ran out , and he after her , but she got into some Neighbour 's House , and so he came back again . By and by some-body came in , and told him , his Wife was miscarried ; What , says the Prisoner to the Deceas 'd , was your Wife with Child ? Yes , says the Deceas 'd , and that 's more than yours will ever be . How do ye know that ? says the Prisoner . Because , Mr. Tapper , says the Deceas 'd , I have tapp 'd her many a time . Have ye so ? says Tapper , Why then , G - d d - n ye , I 'll tap you . My Back was towards them when I heard this Discourse , but as soon as I turned about the Deceased opened his Waistcoat , and shew 'd me a Wound under his right Breast ; and he said to the Prisoner , Lo you think you sha n't pay for this ? Council . You had all been drinking , had ye not ? Rohan . Yes . Coun . And were you not all got Drunk ? Rohan . No . Coun . Was not you Drunk ? Rohan . No , I tell ye ; why , sure I am not to be persuaded that I was Drunk . Coun . Have you ever seen the Prisoner and the Deceased a drinking together before this Accident ? Rohan . Yes ; but they were always a quarrelling . Coun . How far was you off when the Deceas 'd receiv 'd the Wound ? Rohan . About three Yards ; but I did not see it given . Coun . Was not the Deceas 'd a paring his Nails just before this happen 'd ? Rohan . I do n't know . Coun . Did you hear no mention of a Whetstone ? Rohan . Not as I remember . Coun . How long did the Deceas 'd live after the Accident ? Rohan . Eleven Days , from the 11th of last Month to the 22d , and the Coroner sat on him on the 25th of the same . The Deceas 'd told me ( when he was under the Surgeon 's Care ) that if the Prisoner would be so good as to pay the Surgeon , he 'd forgive him . I afterwards met the Prisoner accidentally in Bishopsgate-street , and asked him , how he could be so barbarous as to stab the Deceas 'd ? and he answer 'd , I am only sorry that I did not give him a prick on the other side . Ann Hoskins . I am a Servant to Mr. Creed , at the Bell and Magpye Alehouse in Bishopsgate-street , the Prisoner used to drink at our House ; he came in , and I said to him , How could you stab Mr. Cannon ? G - d d - n his Blood , says the Prisoner , I am only sorry that I did not cut his Throat . Joseph Ackers . I was at Mr. Creed 's on the 18th of the last Month , and the People were telling the Prisoner that he had half a Guinea to pay the Surgeon ; and the Prisoner answer 'd , Damn him , I 'll go and pay the Surgeon the half Guinea , and then I 'll stab him [ Cannon ] on the other side . Richard Austin . The same Day that the Jobb was done , the Deceas 'd would have made the Matter up for a Guinea to pay the Surgeon , but the Prisoner refus 'd , and said , if any Body would give him a Quartern of Gin he would stick him on the other side , and send him out of the World . Mary Richards . When the Prisoner was at Mr. Creed 's , I ask 'd him why he stabb 'd the Deceas 'd ; and he said , Damn him , I 'll give him a prick on the other side , and that will set him upright . Margaret Roberts . A little before the Deceas 'd dy 'd , he took me by the Hand , and said , Tapper is the Man that has murder 'd me , and I expect that you will see him brought to Justice , that he may suffer himself as he has made me suffer . Henry Batchelor , Surgeon . On the 11th of January , about Three in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came to me , and said , he was stabb 'd . I found a Puncture about an Inch and a half below the Right-pap , it run something upwards , and was about half an Inch long , and three Quarters deep . Next Day he seem 'd tolerably easy , as if the Wound had been in a muscular Part of the Body . The third Day the Wound look 'd well , but the next Morning he was out of Order . I would have blooded him , but he refus 'd . I told him then I would do no more , and advis 'd him to send for an Apothecary ; he was very aint , but the Wound all along digested well openly . He died on the 22d , and on the 24th , I ( with another Surgeon ) opened his right Side , and 2 or 3 Quarts of Blood and Matter was taken out of the Thorax . He had spit no Blood , and I found the Lungs no way touched , but they could not possibly perform their Office with such a Quantity of Blood in the Thorax which was penetrated , tho ' we could not perceive it before the Body was open 'd . He had a Fever , and the Blood lying on the Maphragma , might cause his Urine to be something bloody . He was suddled when he came to me first . Margaret Roberts , the Nurse . He could not lie in his Bed , but was forced to sit bolt up right , for if he lay down , he turn 'd black in the Face , and was almost strangled . I took seven Pints of Blood out of him after he was open 'd . The Prisoner 's Defence . John Cotterell . On the 11th of January , I was in Company with the Deceas 'd , and several others , at his Mother-in-Law 's House , in Gravel-Lane . He went up and call 'd the Prisoner out of Bed to drink and play at Cards . The Deceas 'd play 'd with Wilcox , and lost all his Money ; then he fetch 'd down a Looking-Glass , and made Money of it , and lost that too ; then he would have pawn 'd his Waistcoat , but his Wife would not let him . He got up in a Passion , she ran away , and he after her ; but she got shelter in a Neighbour 's House , and so he came in again . News was brought that she had miscarry 'd ; but afterwards we heard that it was not so bad with her . Coun . Did you hear any Joaks pass about Tapping the Prisoner 's Wife ? Cotterell . No ; the Prisoner was standing at the Table cutting his Nails with a Pen-knife , and he ask 'd the Deceas 'd ( who stood with his Back to the Fire ) if he had never a Whetstone ? No , says he , but there 's a Trowel lies in the Window , whet your Knife on that . The Prisoner took the Trowel , and whetted his Knife for some time ; Uamn the Monkey , says the Deceas 'd , what a Noise he makes with whetting his Knife , there 's no bearing what any Body say . And with that he gave the Prisoner a Push , and turn 'd him round , so that the Prisoner fell with his Back against the Table , and he fell over the Prisoner . The Deceas 'd got up again , and said , he had prick 'd himself , and says the Prisoner , I am sorry for it , but it was your own fault , why did you push me when I had a Knife in my Hand . They were both drunk . About 3 or 4 Days after this , I was talking with the Deceas 'd , about this Accident , and he said , It was all owing to his Wife , and the old Bitch her Mother . Coun . Where was Joseph Rohan when the Deceas 'd was hurt ? Cotterell . He was talking with Wilcox at the farther End of the Room . Tho Smith . Cotterell and I call 'd upon the Deceas 'd , he was just come down Stairs , we were not for staying , but he would run up and call the Prisoner . We drank together , and then went to Cards . The Deceas 'd won the Prisoner 's last Half-penny , and then play 'd with Wilcox . They play 'd for a Farthing a Game , till the Deceas 'd had lost all his Money . Then he fetch 'd down a Looking-Glass , and sold it for 15 d. and lost all that Money too . And when that was gone , he stripp 'd off his Dimitty-Waistcoat , and bid his Wife go and pawn it for 2 s. You Rogue , says she , you had more need fetch my Smock out of pawn . And you Bitch , says he , I 'll beat your Brains out . She ran into the Lane and made an Out-cry , and he follow 'd her , but she got into a House , and he came back again . The Prisoner went to the Table to pare his Nails , and ask 'd for a Whetstone . The Deceas 'd told him there was a Trowel in the Window , and he might whet his Knife upon that , which the Prisoner did , but while he was whetting , the Deceas 'd said , Damn the Fellow , what a Noise he makes with his Knife ; and then gave him a shove by the Shoulder that turn 'd him round , so as he fell backwards against the Table , and had been quite all along on the Ground if the Table had not been in the way , and then the Deceas 'd fell over him , for they were both fuddled and stagger 'd . When the Deceas 'd got up , he shew 'd me the Wound ; Bless me , says I , how came that ? I do n't know , says he , but it 's all along of that Bastard Tapper 's Nonsense . Coun . Did you hear the Deceas 'd say any Thing about Tapping , Mr. Tapper 's Wife . Smith . No , not a Word ; if any such thing had been spoke , I must have heard it . Edward Wilcox . The Deceas 'd won the Prisoner 's Money , I won it again from the Deceas 'd , who then bid his Wife pawn his Waistcoat . She said he should not play there to pawn his Cloaths , and so she snatch 'd up the Cards and ran out , he follow 'd her , but came back again , and said , she was got in a Neighbour 's House . Word was brought that she was in a Fit , and that a Midwife was sent for . Her Mother went to her , and in a little time return 'd and said , Thank God she 's recover 'd , for a Surgeon has been there and blooded her . The Prisoner was standing and paring his Nails at a Table by the Window , and ask 'd for a Whetstone . The Deceas 'd who stood with his Back to the Fire , and not far from him , bid him take the Trowel that lay in the Window by him , he took it , and whetted his Knife . The Deceas 'd did not like the Noise , and so push 'd him down , and fell over him ; but there was then no quarrel between them . The Deceas 'd got up , and said , Jack , you have hurt me , do you think you shall not pay for this ? And then he went out , and said , he would get a Warrant . I went to see him afterwards , and ask 'd , how he did ? He said the Wound was pretty well ; but he had got out in a thin Coat without a Wastcoat , and had got Cold . A little before his Death , he blam 'd his Wife for putting him in a Passion , and said he never intended to take the Prisoner up . When the Surgeon first prob 'd him , he said it was but a frivolous Wound . Thomas Williamson . I saw the Deceas 'd in the Little-Old-Bailey , on the first Day of last Sessions [ January 14 . ] and ask 'd him about the Accident . He told me , if it had not been for the Bitch his Wife , it had never happen 'd , for he had never minded the Prisoner whetting his Knife , if she had not put him in a Passion , and that thereupon he push 'd the Prisoner against the Table . Afterwards I saw him and the Prisoner drinking together very friendly , and he being poor , desir 'd the Prisoner to give him half a Guinea to pay the Surgeon . Henry Allen . I ask 'd the Deceas 'd how the Wound happen 'd , and says he , I do n't know very well ; I got it when I push 'd him against the Table ; but Damn it , I do n't mind it , I 'll drink it off . When he spoke this the Prisoner was with him , and they shook Hands , and seem 'd very good Friends . I have been acquainted with the Prisoner 7 Years , he was always a quiet Man , and not given to quarrel . Several others appear 'd to the Prisoner 's Character , and swore that they had known him many Years , that they had been drinking in his Company many hundred Times ; that he had often taken even blows patiently , without returning the ill Usage . The Jury acquitted him , and found that Cannon 's Death was accidental . 19 , 20.

I put them into the Pantry , and the Prisoner took them . Coun . Did you see her take them ? Powell . Yes . Coun . And why did not you stop her ? Powell .

When Mr. Bass was under Misfortune , he conceal 'd himself in my House in Stepney-Fields . The Prisoner brought some Goods to him , and he sent for a Taylor to make him a Waistcoat out of one of the Pieces of Camblet ; but I do n't know that the Goods she brought were the same that were taken out of the Tap-House . Prisoner . I was Mr. Brass 's Servant ; when his Wife was ill , he sent for me to Nurse her . He had his Goods seiz 'd , and some of the Servants , by his Directions , convey 'd away what they could , and these Goods might be taken away in the same manner for any thing that I know to the contrary ; but Tom Powell ( taking the Advantage of my Master 's not daring to appear ) carried off 20 Casks of Cyder , and John Cutting stole my Master 's great Coat .

Half-penny in Money , the 30th of January last . William Davis . On the 30th of January , between 9 and 10 at Night , as I was going from Hackney towards London , I saw the two Prisoners before me , for the Moon did shine as bright as Day ; O law ! thinks I , what must I do , here 's a couple of Rogues ! and so they came up to me , and Faxton , who had a Knife in his Hand , held it to my Throat , and said , Stand , and deliver , or you are a dead Man ! upon that I gave Smith a Silver Groat , and 5d . Half-penny , and then he took my Hat , and gave me another that was not worth 2d . and bid me go on , and told me , if I spoke a Word , I was a dead Man . Going along I met Wingfield ( who is a Servant at the King 's Head ) and Mr. Oram [ Oswald ] with 2 great Dogs . I told them what had happen 'd , Wingfield and I and one Dog went after them to London-Field , but not finding them , we came back to Mr. [ Oswald ] Oram . We saw a Man at the Salmon and Ball Door , and he told us 2 such Men as I had described were just gone from thence . Faxton , the tall Man , was in a Pea Jacket , and Smith , the short Man , in a brown Coat ; we pursu 'd them again to London-Field , but could not find them , and so Wingfield went home . But the Prisoners were taken the same Night by Wingfield , and Mr. Oram . When they were carried before Justice Norris , Faxton fell on his Knees , and own 'd that the Hat was mine , and that he and Smith had robb 'd me of a Groat . As they were going to Newgate , Smith said to Faxton , Ye whiddling Dog , now you have hang 'd your self , and me too , but if I had a Knife , I 'd cut your Throat . Mr. Oram . Between 10 and 11 at Night , I call 'd at the King's-Head , in hopes of finding Company to go over the Fields with . Wingfield told me , that a Man had been robb 'd that Night , by two Foot-Pads , and offer 'd his Service to go with me . We took a Dog with us , and went towards the place where the Robbery was committed . We saw 2 Men before us , one a tall Man in a Pea Jacket , and the other a short Man in a brown Coat . Says Wingfield , I believe , those are the Rogues , for they answer the Description . We stepp 'd up to them , I took Faxton by the Collar , he trembled very much , and Wingfield seiz 'd Smith . We charg 'd them with the Robbery . Damn ye , says Faxton , do you think if we were Guilty , we would let you take us ? No , says Smith , we 'll fight the 2 brightest Men in Hackney . We carry 'd them to the Shoulder of Mutton , but the People of the House were gone to Bed , and so we took them to the Buffaloe's-Head , in Hackney . Next Morning we had them before the Justice , and sent for the Prosecutor . The Room was full of People , but as soon as he came in , he fixt his Eye upon Smith , and said , That is one of them . Says some Body , who is the other ? He look 'd about , and presently pointing to Faxton , said , That 's he , I 'll swear . While the Mittimus was making , some Body advised Faxton to confess , and be an Evidence , upon which he came forward , and told the Justice , that he and Smith committed the Fact , and desired to be made an Evidence . With that , says Smith , I know I shall be hang 'd , but he shall be hang 'd too . Wingfield . Mr. Oram and I took the Prisoners , as he has related . When they were before the Justice , Faxton fell on his Knees , and confess 'd that he and Smith committed the Robbery , and that the Hat Smith then had on , was the same as they took from the Prosecutor ; then Smith said , G - d d - n my Eyes , now we are both hang 'd , but I shall have one to hang with me . As we were going away , Smith said to me , If you 'll go to Oswald 's Window-shutters , you 'll find the Silver Groat that I thrust in there last Night . When I came thither , the Window-shutters were open 'd , and it was fallen down . Mr. Dennis . When Faxton was before the Justice , he was advised to confess in order to be made an Evidence . Upon which he fell on his Knees , and confess 'd the Fact , and that the Hat Smith had on was the same they took from the Prosecutor , only the Loop was cut off , and another put on . He had scarce spoke when Smith doubling his Hands together , said , G - d d - n my precious Eyes and Limbs ! that Word has Hang 'd us both ! but I wo n't be Hang 'd alone . If I had a Knife , I 'd stick ye thus Minute , and will do it before next Sessions . Constable . I heard Smith swear that he would stick Faxton ; and he told us that he had hid the Silver Groat in the ledge of Mr. Oswald 's Shutters . John Davis , the Prosecutor 's Father . As we were coming from the Justice , Smith said to me , Old Man ! I am a dead Man , give me four penny-worth of Half-pence , and I 'll tell you where the Silver Groat is . So when we came to Mr. Oswald 's , at the Shoulder of Mutton , I changed a Shilling and gave him a Groat , and the Silver Groat was found according to his Directions . This is the same , 't is a bended King William 's Groat . Prisoner . Smith . The Prosecutor could not swear to the Hat . Mr. Justice Norris . Fallum confess 'd the Fact before me , and as far as I know , it was voluntary . Smith was in a great Rage and Fury about it , and said he knew he should die , but the other should die with him . I desir 'd him to let the Prosecutor look on the Hat to see if it was his , but he refus 'd , upon which I order 'd it to be taken from him . The Prosecutor looked on it , and said , I believe it is mine , but the Loop is taken off . Richard Hoskins . I live in Lamb-Alley , without Bishopsgate , and make Bolognia Pudding , and Smith is of the same Trade . Jane Hoskins , Smith 's Aunt . The Prisoner has been at Sea several Years ; his Mother makes Sausages , and he sells them for her . The Jury found them both guilty of the Indictment . Death . 38.

John Smith . I hir 'd the Prisoner for a Servant , at 4 l. a Year , but was weary of her before she had been with me a Month . At the Month 's End I let her have 20 s. and then I got her out of my House , and glad I was to pass with her so . The same Day a former Servant of mine came to see me , and I being without a Maid , desired her to stay with me a Day or two . I gave her my Keys , and when she open 'd my Drawers , she told me every thing was out of Order ; and what 's become of your Gold Rings , says she , and the Money that you used to keep here ? Became of 'em ? says I , why there should be 2 Gold Rings , and 15 Pounds . Well , says she , here 's neither Rings nor Money . I found what she said was true ; I got a Warrant ; the Prisoner was apprehended , and committed the Poultry-Compter . I and Mr. Bennet went to a Tavern near the Compter-Gate , and sent for her , and an Officer brought her to us . She told me she had not got my Money , but that it was in such a Place in my House . I was called out of the Room , and at my return I saw my 2 Gold Rings , 7 Moidores , 2 Broad Pieces , and 2 Guineas lying on the Table . This was all the that I had lost , except 1 Broad Piece . She said she had no more . William Bennet . When we had got a Warrant , I went with the Prosecutor in quest of the Prisoner ; we found her in Southwark , she deny 'd that she knew any thing of the Money . After she was committed , she sent to the Prosecutor , and he and I went to a Tavern near the Compter , and she was brought to us : She confess 'd that she had taken the Money out of the Drawer , but not out of the Room ; for she said it was left in a Tin Box behind the Chest . The Prosecutor was call 'd out by a Woman , and while he was absent , she told me , that she had the Money about her , and would deliver it to me if I would persuade her Master to be favourable . Then she took out this Money and these Rings , wrapt in this Rag . The Jury found her guilty . Death . But both the Jury and the Prosecutor recommended her to the Court for a favourable Report to his Majesty . 41 , 42 , 43.

Value 6 s. and 4 s. in Money , Jan. 26 . And Sarah Wheatley , alias Whittle , was indicted for receiving a silk Scarf , being part of the said Goods , knowing it to have been stolen . Edward Prior . At Midnight , on Wednesday the 26th of Jan. last , as I was going along St. John's-street , I saw 4 Fellows before me , I suspected them to be Rogue , but was not very uneasy on that Account ; for I thought they could hard- be so abandon 'd , but that they would pay some Regard to the Cloth , and not presume to attack a Clergyman . Encouraged by this Reflection , I past them , and turned up Swan-Alley , when presently I heard 2 Men come tripping after me . I then began to think that I had entertained a more favourable Opinion of them than they deserved : I mended my Pace , and they theirs , till I came into the brought Part of the Alley ; and then Thomas Edwards ( that young Lad at the Bar ) came forward , and held a Knife to me thus - and bad me stand , which I did . Thomas Past ( that down looking Fellow ) came up next with something in his Hand , which then , in the Fright I was in , I took to be a Pistol ; but I have since been informed , that it was nothing but a clasp 'd Knife . James Tripland and Thomas Back came last , and demanded my Watch , and my Money , I gave them 4 s. and some Half-pence , which was all the Money I had about me ; but as for the Watch , I told them I had got none , tho ' at the same time I had it in my Hand ; for when I heard them coming after me , I slipt it out of my Pocket . Then one of them snatch 'd off my Hat , and another took away my Scarf : They swore at me , and made me run down an Alley , and then they went off . On the Sunday following , some Persons came from Rag-Fair to visit a Man in Swan-Alley , near my Brother ( Mr . Prior ) 's Brewhouse ; and they sent for a Pot of Beer , and so they fell into Discourse . And how goes Trade your Way ? says one . Why , truly , but so so , says another ; but Robbing goes forward however . Robbing ? says a third . Ay , says the second , see what a pass the World is come to ! we had a Clergyman robb 'd here last Wednesday Night between 12 and 1 . A Clergyman ? says the fourth to the first , Why did not we see some Fellows in Rag-Fair with a Parson 's Hat ? And so we did , now I think of it , says his Neighbour . The Alehouse-Man who was one of the Company , acquainted my Brother with what had pass 'd , and the Prisoners were afterwards taken in Rag-Fair . Court . You say you was robb 'd about Midnight , was it dark ? Prior . It was Moon-light ; but the Moon was a little clouded . Court . How long did the Persons that robb 'd you stay with you ? Prior . About 5 or 6 Minutes . Court . Did you ever see any of them before ? Prior . No ; not to my Knowledge . Court . You say you was under such Confussion that you took a clasp Knife to be a Pistol ; how then can you recollect to perfectly that these are the very Men who robb 'd you ? Prior . I should not have been so positive , if my Opinion had not been supported by Thomas Beck , one of those concerned in the Fact . Court . Was you positive to the Prisoners when before the Justice ? Prior . I was more positive to some than to others I fix 'd upon Past and Edwards for two of them . Court . Could you be positive to Tripland without the help of Beck 's Evidence ? Prior . I should be very cautious of being positive as to him : He was a dirty , thick-set short Fellow ; but there may be many such about Town . Past . Did not you say before the Justice , that you was positive to none but Edwards ? Prior . I said indeed , that Edwards 's Countenance struck me most ; but at the same time I said I believ 'd the others were the Men . And as to Edward 's , there is one thing , in which I can not but observe the Hand of Providence . When he was taken up , and was about to be carried before the Justice , he chang 'd his Coat , in order , as I suppose , to disguise himself , but the Coat that he then put on , was the very Coat that he wore when he robb 'd me ; or one that was pretty much like it . Thomas Beck . About 11 o'Clock , I and Edwards , and Tripland met with Past in Bishopsgate-street . My Lads , says he , what Lay do you go upon . They told me they could find no better Business than stealing Lead . That 's but a foolish way of living ; you had much better stop a Coach . I proposed to go into Widegate-Alley to break open a House , but at last we agreed upon Street-Robbery . We went to Shoreditch , and attempted to stop a Coach , but the Coachman whipped his Horses , and drove into Hoxton-square . Going a little farther , Past cry 'd out , Boys , here 's a Cock ! Court . What did he mean by a Cock ? Beck . A Man . We came up to this Man , but he cry 'd out Fire ! Fire ! and so we let him pass , for fear he should alarm all the Neighbourhood . We went along Old-street , and so to St. John's-street , without doing any Business : But in St. John's-street , Paste called out again , Boys , says he , Here 's a Smallcoal-man ; let us stop him , for they wear the best of Hats . Court . A Smallcoal-man , what did he mean by that ? Beck . A Parson : We always call a Parson a Smallcoal-man , because their Dresses are pretty much alike . So we look 'd in the Parson 's Face , and let him go on , but we follow 'd at a little Distance . He turned down Swan-Alley , when Edwards stept forward with a Knife in his Hand , and stopt him . Whereof another Man was coming by at the same Time , and Past said , Boys ! bid him stand , which we did . I sell a swearing at the Parson for his Watch , but he said he had none . Then I swore and cursed bloodily for his Money , and he gave me four Shillings , and 3 Half pence . Then Past took the Parson 's Hat , and Tripland his Scarf ; and so we left the poor Parson , and went into Catherine-wheel Alley and stole a Hundred Weight of Lead off of one of the new Houses that are unfinish 'd . We were afterwards all taken , and I gave Information against my Companions . I have known Tripland and Past but a little while ; but I have been acquainted with Edwards many Years . He and I have stole 30 Hundred Weight of Lead together . Benjamin Ward . On Thursday the 27th of January , as I was standing at my Shop-door in Rag-Fair , I saw the Prisoner and Beck playing the Rogue together , and pushing one another over the Kennel . I did not like their Looks and so I took notice of 'em . Beck had got on a great flopping Hat , without Loops . Says I to my Journeyman , does that great Hat look as if it belong 'd to that Fellow ? I think it looks more like a Parson 's Hat . John Higginson . I live opposite to Mr. Wood , and took Notice as well he , of their playing the Rogue together , and that such a shabby Fellow as Beck should wear such a great Hat . Rich Hancock , Headborough . On Jan. 30 I went to see a Man that was sick and lame in Swan-Alley . We sent for a Pot of Beer to his Room . The Alehouse-man who brought it , talk 'd about Trade , and said there was nothing but Robbing there-a-way , for some Rogues had robb 'd a Parson . What , says I , do they rob the Cloth ? And says Mr. Wood ( who was with us ) I saw 4 Men that had got a Parson 's Hat among 'em in Rag-Fair . The Alehouse-man told this to Mr . Prior the Brewer , who sent for us , and we told him what we knew . Next Day Mr. Wood sent me Word that the 4 Men were gone into the Yorkshire Grey Alehouse . We went in and seized Past and Tripland , for Edwards and Beck were gone out before we came . But Mr. Archer and a Watchman went out and took 'em both ; they were all carried to the Watch-house , and then we sent Word of what we had done to Mr . Prior . When they were carried before Justice Haydon , the Parson swore downright to Edwards , and one of 'em said , Do you know me ? and another , Do ye know me ? And he answer 'd , Yes , I have some Knowledge of you now , but I shall know you better when I have observed you a little . The Parson brought me a Warrant to search for his Hat , and by Beck 's Information , we went to John Byton , a Pawn-broker 's in Skinner's-street . Mr. Byton directly said he had such a Hat , and fetch 'd it down to us : This is the Hat . Edw Prior . This is the same that I lost . Beck . We were bid 8 s. 6 d. and a Quartern of Rum for the Hat in Rag-Fair , but we thought it worth more ; and so we went thence to the Poultry Compter to see a young Woman . I was taken ill , and so I deliver 'd the Hat to Past to pawn , and went Home to take a Sweat . Past did not come home till next Morning , and then I asked him what he had done with the Hat ? He said , he had pawn 'd it at the Corner of Skinner's-street for 4 s. or 4 s. 6 d. I know not which . John Byton . Tom Past brought this Hat to me . I had seen him before . Past . Did not you say before the Justice , that you could not swear to me ? Byton . I said an Oath was a tender Thing , but I verily thought that you was the Man . But I knew you full well , and only waved the Matter , because I did not care for the Trouble of attending the Sessions . Daniel Archer . I was with Mr. Hancock , the Headborough , in Swan Ally , where the Discourse happen 'd as he has related . I went with him next Day to the Yorkshire Grey , where we took Past and Tripland , and then I and a Watchman went out to look for Beck and Edwards . We met 'em coming down the Street ; we collar 'd 'em , and brought 'em into Mr. Wood 's House . [ Here the Prisoners were called on to make their Defense . ] Thomas Past . I own myself guilty of the Charge . I am willing to dye , and beg that I may dye . But Tripland is an innocent Man . When we were in New Prison , I said to Beck , why will you swear against Tripland , when you know he is innocent ? And says Beck to me again , I must hang Three , or else I shall never get my Discharge . Thomas Edwards . I confess that I am guilty of the same Fact , but Tripland is Innocent . I never saw him till the Day before we were taken . James Tripland . I was but just come from Sea , and had never seen Back till the Day before we were apprehended . John Ogden . I have known Tripland from a Child ; and I never heard no disfame of his Honour in my Life . He was bound 'Prentice to William Breed in Strout , and afterwards bound himself to Sea . He follow 'd the Sea in Merchants Service 5 Years , but coming home from Lisbon he was press 'd on board the Edenburgh . I saw him at Chrisman , and he told me his Ship was to be paid off , and that he was then going down to Gravsand ; and that was the left time I saw him till he was taken up . [ The Evidence against Sarah Whittle . ] Thomas Back . Whittle had bought Watches and Rings of Tem Past , and so we went to her to sell the Parson 's Scarf . She asked us when we made it ? Court . What did she mean by that Question ? Beek . She meant , when did we srea it , and I told her last Night . Well , says she , and what must you have ? we told her 8 Shillings , she said she could afford to give but a Shillings , and so we let her have it . If I was to break open your Lordship 's House , and make all your Plate , she would buy it of me . Richard Hanoak . As we were carrying the 4 Men before the Justice , some of the Women in Rag-fair said , why do n't ye wake up the Receiver ? Who is that , says I ? Why , Whittle , said they . Sarah Whittle . These Men asked me to buy the Scarf , but I told 'em it would not do for me ; they came again in half an hour , and said , will you buy or no ? and I told 'em , I would have nothing to do with it . John Davison . I asked Beck ( in New Prison ) how he could swear against Whittle ? and he call 'd me Black-guard Bastard , and said he would hang 20 before he 'd hang himself . Three or four Rag-fair women appear 'd to her Character , and said , they knew no harm of her . The Jury acquitted Whittle and Tripland , and found Past and Edwards guilty . Death . 44. John Marsh , of Cripplegate , was indicted for stealing the Coat and Waistcoat of Will May , Feb. 3 . Acquitted . 45 , 46. Uriah Davis and John Edlin , of Hammersmith , were indicted for stealing 2 Heifers , value 4 l. 10 s. the Goods-of Marmaduke Bramly , Jan. 28 . Joseph Sleath . Davis brought the Heifers to Smithfield , and desir 'd me to sell 'em for him . Edlin came with him , but stood at a little distance , and did not speak to me . Marmaduke Bramly . Those were my Heisers , and the same that I had lost . The Jury acquitted Edlin , and found Davis guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 47. Edward Dell , alias Dale , of the Liberty of the Tower , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of John Davis , and taking from thence a Silk Handkerchief , value 3 s. on the 11th of February , about 8 at Night . Mary Davis . I live in George Yard on Tower-hill . About 7 at Night , on Friday was Se'night , as I was sitting with some Friends in a back Room even with my Shop , I heard the Sash of the Shop window break with a great Noise , and a Handkerchief that hung for Sale on a Line in the window , was snatched away . The Prisoner was taken by a Waterman who pursued him . Court . Did you see the Handkerchief taken out ? Davis . No , I only heard the Glass break , and miss 'd the Handkerchief , which I knew was upon the Line but just before . Ann Bolton . I was in the back Room with Mrs. Davis , and heard the Glass broke : I look 'd and saw the Handkerchief taken out , but did not see the Hand that took it . The Shop Door was shut . Joseph Norton , Waterman . I was about 6 or 7 Yards from the Prisoner when the Sash was broke , I saw him smash the window with his hand thus - and snatch out the Handkerchief ; he ran away towards Tower-hill , I pursued him , he dropt the Handkerchief in the Mud , and presently after fell down himself , and so I took him . There was another Fellow with him when he broke the window , but he got off . A little Boy took up the Handkerchief and gave it me , and I gave it to Mr. Lambard . This is the Handkerchief , you may see where 't is cut with pulling through the Glass . Joseph Lombard . I was in the back Room when the window was broke , I ran out in pursuit of the Prisoner , but Mr. Norton had taken him before I came up to him . Prisoner . As I was walking by the Window , a Man came running along , and a Waterman threw a Brick-bat at him , but it miss 'd him , and knock 'd me down , and thereupon he charg 'd me with breaking the Window . The Prosecutor would have discharg 'd me , but the Waterman said , he should get 40 l. for hanging a House-Breaker . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 48.

John Wragg . The Prisoner had been my Journeyman . I have a Wash-house at the Back of my Dwelling-house . On the 17th of Jan. last , between 2 and 4 in the Morning , I was waked by the barking of my little Black Bitch . I got up and look 'd out o'Window . I saw the Glimmering of a Light , but being between sleeping and waking , I thought it might come from my Neighbour the Currier , and that his stirring might disturb the Bitch , and so I went to Bed again . But when I came down Stairs , about 7 in the Morning , I found my House was broke open , and several Goods gone . Some Tiles were taken off the Wash-house , and so the Door was unbarr 'd and open 'd . Then a Hole was cut thro ' the Kitchen-door , and that was open 'd too . When the Prisoner was my Journey-man he 'bizzled my Goods , and lived but a loose Life ; so that I presently inspected him to be the Man ; and so I had him taken up the same Day , and he confess 'd that he brought 3 Men with him , and they broke my House open , and he confessed where he had pawned my Goods , and I found 'em accordingly . John Wilshire . Constable . When I apprehended the Prisoner , he confessed to me that he met 3 Men who were Strangers to him , and proposed to them to go and rob his Uncle ; but as they were going he told them he 'd shew them a nearer Place , and so brought 'em to his Master 's House , which they broke open and robbed . Thomas Wilshire . The Prisoner told me , that on Sunday-Night , the 16th of Jan. as he was going by the Savoy Gate , he met 3 Men , who asked him to walk with 'em . They told him they wanted Money ; and he advised them to go with him and rob his Master ; which they did . Daniel Fair . The Prisoner said he met 3 Men as he was coming from the Savoy Stairs ; and after some Talk with him , they said they were bent upon getting some Money that Night . He at first advised to rob and murder his Uncle , but afterwards told them his Master 's House was nearer ; and so they all went thither . James Robinson . The Prisoner told me the same , and said farther , that on Saturday Night he intended to murder his Uncle , and had prepared every thing in readiness ; but a Woman happen 'd to be in the Room , and so he was prevented . Joseph Higginson . I live at the 3 Bowls in Long-Acre . Between 8 and 9 on Monday Morning , Jan. 17. the Prisoner brought those four Dishes , 9 Plates , this Hat , Coat , and Woman 's Cloak to my House to pawn . I had seen him 2 or 3 Times before . I examined him , and he told me , the Pewter was his Mother 's Goods , and marked with her Maiden Name ; and that his Father and Mother were dead . Amos Haton . I live with my Uncle at the 3 Bowls in Heming 's Row . On the 17th of Jan. the Prisoner brought this Tea-kettle , and these 3 Brass Candlesticks to our House , and wanted 7 s. on them , but I let him have but 3 s. I had dealt with him several Times before . Prisoner . My Master knows that I was out of my Senses , and endeavoured to make away with my self before his House was broke open . Ann Jackson . The Prisoner was quartered 8 or 9 Months upon my Landlord . He courted a young Woman , and the Day that he was to be married , the Bride never came , but went away for New-market . Upon which he got into my Room , and went to cut his Throat with a Razor , but I broke the Door open , and prevented him . I believe he has not been in his right Senses ever since . Grace Bunt , the Prisoner 's Sister . No Body could accuse him of any Ill before Mr. Wragg 's House was broke ; but Mr. Wragg knows he was out of his Senses . Eliz . Melvin . The Prisoner was quarter 'd at my House , and behaved so well , that when his Quarters were out , I took him for a Lodger . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 51. Robert Atkinson , of St. Martins in the Fields , Sadler , was indicted for the Murder of Ann Atkinson , his Mother , by throwing her down a pair of Stairs , upon a Pavement of Tiles below , and by which fall her Skull was broke , and she receiv 'd one mortal Bruise , of which she instantly dy 'd , the 15th of this Instant February . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Mary Parrot , the Prisoner 's Maid . Last Tuesday was Seven-night , between 12 and 1 , my Mistress ( the Prisoner 's Mother ) told me I might go to Bed ( for I was not very well ) and she would sit upto let my Master in ; and so I did . My Bed is below in the Kitchin , and my Mistress lies with me . I fell asleep , and was waked with a Noise above Stairs about One or Two o'Clock . The Prisoner was knocking violently against the Inside of the Door of the Room where he lay , the Room is even with the Shop ; and I heard him call out , Damn ye , ye old Bitch , do ye think I 'll be lock 'd up in my own House ? My Mistress told him she would not open his Door , till she had open 'd the Street Door first : I heard her open the Street Door , and go out , and shut it after her . As soon as she was gone , my Master came down into the Kitchin , and call 'd to me ; Mary , says he , where are ye ? Here , Sir , says I ; What in Bed ? says he ; Yes , Sir , says I ; What do ye want ? I am come to bid you good Night , says he , give me a Buss . I was very much frighted , for he was stark naked without his Shirt . Sir , says I , you had much better go to Bed : No , says he , I will have a Buss first . He came to my Bed-side , and as he did not offer any Rudeness , I suffer 'd him to kiss me once or twice , in hopes that he would then go away . But instead of that , he got upon the Bed ( out side the Bed-Clothes ) and lay upon me ry hard , and endeavour 'd to pu his Hand into the Bed , but with much difficulty I kept them out ; I begg 'd him to leave me , and look after my Mistress , who was gone into the Street , and might come to some hurt a that time of Night . I had hardly spoke , when my Mistress appear 'd by my Bed-side ( for she had the Key of the Street-Door in or Pocket when she was dead . ) You Dog , said she , what business have you upon the Maid 's Bed ? With that he got up and said , Damn ye , you old Bitch , I do n't know what Business you have in my House . She ran into the Coal-Vault to hide herself , and in running , her Candle went out . He ran to the Fire , and lighted a Match , and went to look for her ; but she got by him and ran up Stairs , and he after her . I heard a great Scuffle , and a Struggling in the Passage at the Stairs Head as if he was running after her , and she was endeavouring to get away from him ; I heard no Blows indeed , but presently she fell down with such Violence , as if Part of the House had fall'n with her : She neither spoke , nor so much as groan 'd . He ran down immediately after her , and cry 'd out , Damn the old Bitch , I have murder 'd her , and I shall be hang 'd for her . Mary ! bring me a Candle . I am coming Sir , says I , but being in a Fright , I ran up Stairs in my Shift to Mr. Gold 's Chamber , and begg 'd that I might stay there a little , ( Mr. Gold and his Brother lie together . ) Aye , pray do , said they , and bolt the Door , for in his Passion he may murder us too . The Prisoner continued calling out , Mary ! bring a Light ! I have murder 'd my dear Mother , and I shall be hang 'd ; after some time the Gentlemen bid me call the Watch , and then I ventur 'd down again . The Street Door was open , and a Washerwoman came in with a Candle and Lanthern ; but I was in such a Fright , that I do n't remember whether it was I or any Body else that open 'd the Door . Then the Prisoner call 'd for a Knife , or a Fork to bleed his Mother ; I brought him a Fork , he prick 'd her Arm , it bled a little , and he said , He would give a 1000 l. to save her Life . She had a Napkin on her Head , and it was bloody . The Prisoner sent for a Surgeon , and Mr. Martin came and said , he believ 'd she was dead . Court . How long had you liv 'd with the Prisoner ? Parrot . About a Month . Court . How did he behave himself to his Mother in that time ? Did you ever observe that he treated her with ill Usage ? Parrot . He would sometimes scold at her as I thought , but I do n't know what he said , because he us 'd to speak in French ; but at such times I have seen him pull her by the Nose , and push his Hand in her Face , thus - Court . In Anger ? Parrot . Yes . Prisoner . Did not you say you would hang me if you could , and that you would hang me rather than be hang 'd your self ? Parrot . No , some People that were strangers to me were saying , that if they had been as me , they would have let my Master have lain with them to have saved his Life . And I answer 'd , that I would see half the World hang 'd before he should lye with me , or Words to that purpose . Prisoner . How much Liquor did you fetch your Mistress that Night ? Parrot . About 2 o'Clock I fetch 'd her half a Pint of Gin and Bitter ( I think they call it ) and she gave me a Glass to carry to the Watch and to another Woman . I never saw her fuddled in my Life , and yet I know she would drink a great deal ; but she was so much used to it , that it would hardly disorder her . Prisoner . Was I drunk or sober ? Parrot . I can not say you was drunk , I have seen you much worse , I believe you had been drinking , but you seem 'd to be sensible , only you was in a great Passion . Prisoner . How did I behave my self after you came down ? Parrot . I was so frighted that I could not take particular Notice ; but I remember you trembled and said , You would give a thousand Pounds to save her Life . Arthur Gold . I lodg 'd up one Pair of Stairs at the Prisoner 's House , about 2 in the Morning I heard a violent Out-cry of Murder . I waked my younger Brother who lay with me , and the Noise continuing I went down and found the Prisone ( in his Shirt and Breeches , without his Wag ) opening the Street Door , his Mother had a Candle in her Hand , and Mrs. Bormen stood crying with her Hair loose about her Ears , and the Prisoner gave her several Blows , and call 'd the Watch , and bid them carry her Home , or to the Roundhouse . I asked him if he was not asham 'd of himself , he said , She was an but his Mother said , was and Woman , and had brought him had lost his Watch and his M. When Mrs. Brown was gone , I was going upto bed again ; but the Deceas 'd pull 'd me by the Sleeve , and pointed to his Door that I should get him to Bed . I persuaded him into his Room , and he sat down on the Bed side . As he was undressing himself , he told his Mother , that she was a wicked , drunken Monster , and a base Woman ; that she had been the Ruin of him ; that all his Misfortunes were owing to her , and that he had paid 15 or 16 l. for her but a few Days before . His Mother said , if it was so , it did not become him to tell her of it in that manner . He was in a great Passion , but at last I got him to Bed , and we went out ; I shut his Door , and his Mother shut the Door of the Shop that goes into the Passage . I advised her to go to Bed , she thank 'd me , and went down , and I went up . Court . Was either of them drunk ? Gold . I believe they had both been drinking , but they both spoke perfectly well , and appear 'd to be well in their Senses ; I had not been a-Bed three Minutes when I heard a violent Noise at his Door . He swore he would not be lock 'd in , but would break open the Door . I thought then he was coming to have a farther Dispute with his Mother , for I did not think the Maid was in the House because I had not seen her when he quarrell 'd with Mrs . Bowman . While he was knocking at his own Door . I heard his Mother say . If I must open this Door , I 'll have it . When his Door was open 'd , I heard the Street Door shut , and then I was pretty easy . But soon after I heard a running and a scuffling Noise , as if two were struggling , and something fell down with a violent Force . After which I heard somebody come up to my Door barefoot , I at first thought it was the Prisoner , but opening the Door I found it was the Maid . Lord , Sir , says she , my Master has murder 'd my Mistress , and I am afraid murder me too ; and so I let he in . We all went down in a little time , and I believe my Brother open 'd the Street Door and call 'd the Watch . I went into the Kitchin , and found the Prisoner sitting stark naked with his Mother 's Head in his Lap . He cry 'd , O God ! God ! what shall I do ? my Mother is dead ! George Miller , Watchman . As I was crying the hour of the Night , I came to the Prisoner 's Door , and found a strange Watchman . What do you do here Friend , says I , Why , says he , I have lit a Man and a Woman hither . I heard a sort of a Dispute with a Woman within doors , and by and by the Deceas 'd came out and asked who I was ? and I told her , I was her Watchman , so she bid me fetch a Pint of Beer to make my Brother Watchman drink , which I did ; and when I was come back with the Beer , I heard words encrease betwixt the Prisoner and the Woman , and at last I heard Blows , and the Woman cry 'd Murder 3 times ; with that I knock 'd at the Door heartily , and the Prisoner open 'd it . Who are you ? says he , I am your Watchman , Sir , says I ; then light this Woman safe home , says he , and I 'll give you Six-pence ; but when he felt in his Pocket he had no Money , and so he asked his Mother for some , she said she had neither Copper nor Silver . Why then , damn it , ( says he , in a Passion ) give me some Gold ! The Woman had no Head-clothes on when she came out of his House , but she had 'em in her hand , and put 'em on at the Door , and so we lighted her home , and she gave us a Shilling . I came again to the beginning of my Beat , and then I went to the Prisoner 's door , and found a Washer-woman there , and she said she believed there was Murder done ; so I went in ( for the Door was open ) and down Stairs , and there I saw the Prisoner sitting as naked as ever he was born , with his Mother 's Head betwixt his Legs ; I went and called the Constable , and other Watch , and the Prisoner said , he had murdered his dear Mother , the best Friend he had in the World , and called for a Penknife , or a Rezor , to let her blood . Court . Are you sure he said murder 'd ? Miller . Yes . And Mr. Cockerel , the Constable , was there at the same time . James Cockerel . I came thither betwixt 3 and 4 , the Prisoner had then got a Gown on , and a Man and a Woman were holding the Deceas 'd up . The Prisoner said , he was afraid his poor Mother was dead . Court . Did you hear any Expression about Murder ? Cockerel . I do n't remember any such . William Plowman , Watchman . I found the Prisoner sitting stark naked , with his Mother 's Head between his Legs ; I asked him why he sat in that Posture ? and he told me that he never lay in a Shirt . And , says he , I am afraid I have killed my dear Mother , and I shall be hang 'd . Lend me a Fork , or a Penknife to save her Life if I can . Then I went for Mr. Martin the Surgeon . John Barber , the Prisoner 's Apprentice . I was waked about 2 in the Morning , by a Noise which was made in the Quarrel with Mrs . Bowman , who is our Embroideress . I heard her Shriek , and cry Murder . The Prisoner bid the Watch take her away , and she said , Ay , for God 's Sake do , get me out of this House . After she was gone , I heard my Master knock at his Room-Door , and say , That be would not be lock 'd up in his own House . And his Mother said , What a-devil ails the Man ? I wo n't open it ; or if I do , I 'll go into the Street . Then I heard both the Doors open , and the Street-Door shut to again ; and in a little time I heard her open the Street-Door with the Key , and come in . Court . Where was you when you heard all this ? Barber . I lay up 3 pair of Stairs , but the Stair-Case is made with a Well-hole , so that I could hear very plainly . Then something fell down stairs , and any Master cry 'd , O ! what have I done ? What have I done ? Mary ! Mary ! bring a Light ! Capt . Dunbar , who lodges in our 2 pair of Stairs Room , called out to me , For God 's Sake , Jack , get up , he 'll murder the poor old Woman ! So I went down , and he was making his Complaint , and said , O my poor dear Mother ; she is dead . Why wo n't you speak to me ? he bid me fetch a Surgeon . I went up and saw several Watchmen , and I sent one of them for Mr. Martin , and went myself for Mr. Weems . Court . Did you ever observe that he treated her in an undutiful Manner ? Barber . No . Mr. Martin , Surgeon . I was called up about 3 to come to the Deceas 'd ; I found her lying along on her Back : Says I , She 's dead , you have no need of me . The Prisoner was standing sideways , and desired me to bleed her ; I prick 'd her Arm , but she bled but about a Spoonful , for there was no Circulation of the Blood . I observed a Wound on the back-part of the Head , about an Inch long . Next Day the Coroner sent for me , and ( Mr. Weems being with me ) I opened the Skull , and found it crack 'd in two Places from Ear to Ear , and a Piece of the Skull separated ; so that it was impossible she should ever speak after the Blow . There was much extravasted Blood . Mr. Weems , Surgeon . Between 3 and 4 in the Morning , I found the Deceas 'd dead ; I felt of the Wound , but found no Fracture at that Time ; I did not see the Prisoner , he being then in the next Room . I came again the next Day , and found the Skull crack 'd 4 or 5 Inches , and a vast deal of extravasated Blood contained in the Ventricles of the Brain . [ The Prisoner 's Defence . ] All that know me inwardly , know that I lov 'd my Mother above all Things ; that I lov 'd her as dearly as any thing upon Earth ; and I believe she has said the same to all the World . I went out in the Morning to speak with Capt . Randal , and from him I went to Mr. Hasleton , the Riding-Master 's , and so to several others , drinking with one and with another . I was at the Tavern all the Afternoon , and went to the Ale-house at Night : From thence I went to Mrs . Bowman 's ; she ask 'd me for my Watch , and a few Shillings that I had , that she might take care of them , and so she came home with me . My Mother ask 'd her to stay and lie with her , and so did I too , but she would not consent , and that put me in a Passion , and so I beat her , and called the Watch to take her away . When she was gone , Mr. Gold put me to bed , but I did not like to be lock 'd in , and so I got out and went down to the Maid without my shirt , and laid myself upon the Bed ; and then my poor Mother came down , and ask 'd me what Business I had with the Maid ? and so I got up , and - and - my Mother run into the Coal-Vault , and I lighted a Match to look for her , but then she run Up-stairs , and I followed her ; and some how or another , as she was endeavouring to get by me in the Dark , I suppose her Foot slipp 'd , and she fell down . And this is the Truth , as I hope to see the Face of Almighty God . William Atkinson , the Prisoner 's Brother . I am Cook to Col. Handiside , and used to go and visit my Brother when I was at Leisure , and always found a good Harmony between my Mother and him ; and if I had not believ 'd from his constant Behaviour towards her , that he could not be guilty of such a barbarous Action , I would sooner have been an Evidence against him than for him : But he always shew 'd such a tender Regard for her , that if any hasty Expression happened to fall from him , he would be sorry for it . Sometime in September last , I had heard some spightful People say , that he had used her ill , and with unbecoming Language when he was in Drink . I ask 'd my Mother about it , and she said , O Lord , Billy , it 's quite otherwise , he has always treated me in the most tender endearing manner that ever Son did . Ah , Billy , I wish you was but half so good ! She had enough to maintain her and therefore had no need to live with him if he had used her ill : But for 4 or 5 Years past she has been very much given to intoxicate herself with Drink . Mary , the Wife of William Atkinson . I visited my Mother frequently for several Years , and saw nothing but Love and Unity between her and my Brother : I never saw any Disturbance but once . when he desir 'd her not to drink so much . But she always said he was the most endearing Child in the World , and the most dutiful Child that ever Woman bore . About a Year and a half ago , there was some falling out betwixt me and her , and thereupon I said I would never go into her House again ; but however , she came to see me , and always said what a good Son she had . After my Mother 's Death , I heard Mary Parrot say , She would hang the Prisoner before she would be hang 'd herself ; and that she would hang him if possible ; and that the first time she saw him , she believ 'd by his Looks , he would come to be hang 'd one time or another . Court . What reason could she have for saying , She 'd hang him rather than be hang 'd herself ? for it do n't appear that she was in any Danger of being hang 'd . M. Atkinson . I do n't know not I ; but so she said . Court . Mary Parrot , did you say so ? Parrot No ; but some Woman said they would let the Prisoner lye with them to save his Life ; and a Journeyman said , the Prisoner should lye with his Wife rather than be hang 'd ; and they blamed me for not letting him come to bed to me , because , they said , that would have saved his Mother 's Life , and his too . I was very much provoked to hear them talk in that manner ; and so I told them , that I would sooner see half the World hang 'd , than he or any Man else should come to bed to me against my Will . M. Atkinson . There was no such Discourse about lying with her to save his Life ; but she said , she would hang him rather than he hang 'd herself ; and that I 'll swear . Mary Burnet . The Sunday Night before this Accident happened , the Deceas 'd told me , that her Son Robert was the dutifullest Child that ever was born in the World ; that he was the best of Children , and that no Woman could be happier in a Son . I asked Mary Parrot if she knew what she had been Swearing , and if she knew what an Oath was ? and she said , as how , she would swear that - Court . What did she say she would swear ? Mr. Burnet . I ask 'd her if she had swore any thing against him unjustly ? Court . That was a very odd Question ; and what Answer did she make ? Burnet . Why , she said she 'd swear his Life away , before she 'd lose her own . Court . Were those the Words ? Burnet . Yes ; she said she would swear his Life away before he should take her 's . Court . Repeat that again . Burnet . She said she would hang him rather than be hang 'd herself . I am sure she said so . Mary Sunderland . The Sunday Night before the Accident , the Deceas 'd told me she was the happiest Woman alive , in a Son ; and except she pleased , she need never have an angry Word from him ; for it was her Fault if ever she had . Court . How came you to talk about the Prisoner just at that time ? M. Sund . Why , I do n't know . We were talking about Families , and one thing or another . And so it came about . Prisoner . My Mother was continually speaking in my Praise , in all Company where-ever she came . M. Sunderland . I was afraid the Maid , Mary Parrot , had swore too rashly , and so I spoke to her about it ; and she said , she 'd hang him if she could For , says she , If he was not a vile Wretch , he would never have murder 'd his Mother . Ay , says I , Can you swear that ? I have sworn what I thought fit , says she , and what I have swo rn , I will stand to ; and I will hang him if I can . And Mrs. Atkinson was by when she said so . M. Parrot . I do n't know that I ever saw this Woman 's Face before . - Baily . The Night before the Accident , I supp 'd with the Deceased , and we had two Quarts of Beer , and half a Pint of Gin together . O Madam ! says she to me , my poor dear Child is my best Friend ; but when I am ill I dust not let him know it , for fear he should break his Heart . And after she was dead , I says to Mary Parrot , Do ye think that your Master threw his Mother down ? As I hope to be saved , Madam , says she , I do n't know that he did , for I was in Bed . Court . She swears the same now . - Baily . No : But she said she believ 'd he never touch 'd her . And pray , says I , did she drink the Gin that I left ? Yes , Madam , says she , and I fetch 'd her half a Pint more . And , Mary , says I , those are sad , ugly , loose Stairs at your House . Yes , Madam , says she , and so they be . And , says I , the poor old Woman was very fond of her Son . Ay , Madam , says Parrot , she would hang half the World to save him . M. Parrot . I said I had fetch 'd her more Gin , but that she did not drink it ; and the Stairs are not so bad , but my Mistress always went up and down 'em very nimbly in the Dark ; and she thought much to let me have a Candle . There was only one of the Stairs a little loose , and that was at the Bottom . Mr. Watkins . The Deceased was ill last Christmas , and I was her Apothecary . I never saw a Son more dutiful to a Mother , or more concerned for her Welfare ; he was quite tiresome and teazing , in begging me to take care of her , if it cost him all he had in the World . The Passage at the Top of the Kitchen-stairs is not above a Yard wide . The Door that leads down the Stairs is in the Corner ; and the Door into the Shop is almost close to it , not a Foot asunder ; so that any Scuffle there might easily be the Occasion of a Fall ; and if her Foot slipt at the Top , the Stairs are so steep , she must certainly fall to the Bottom . Rachel Reaves . I have known the Prisoner these thirty Years . He was all Obedience and Duty ! A tender affectionate Son at all Times ! The Delight of his Father 's Heart . His Mother was continually praising him . She was always commending him for his Industry , and said , that he left every thing in her Hands . I sat up with her four Nights in a Week when she was sick , and he was always expressing a great Concern for her . Charles Humes . I have been the Prisoner 's Journey-man 4 Years . He was as dutiful a Son to a Mother as ever could be ; and I never observed that he was guilty of using any passionate Expressions . Elizabeth Baxter , a Washer-woman . I have known the Prisoner and his Mother between 4 and 5 Years ; and his Behaviour towards her was always very dutiful , and she always gave him a good Word as far as I know , for I never heard to the contrary . John Tackell , Servant to Col. Handiside . I lodged at the Prisoner 's House 3 or 4 Months in the Year 1727 , and have frequented the House , and he was always a dutiful Son , and she a loving Mother ; for I never heard of any Quarrel between 'em . Major Smith . The Deceased often came to me , to define me to recommend her son to some Customers ; and she told me he was very good to her . - Baily . I was vastly intimate with the Prisoner , who was my Neighbour ; he was a dutiful Son , and she a good Mother . Only she would drink . She has been at my House when she could hardly stand , so that I once affronted her by speaking to her about it ; for , in short , I was afraid , that in time , by their Intimacy , my Wife might follow her Example . I never saw a worse Stair-Case , it is open and steep , dark and dangerous . William Baily , Brother to - Baily . The Prisoner always shew 'd the utmost Tenderness and Concern when he spole of his Mother . So that I believe he would be the last Man in the World that could be guilty of any Barbarity towards her ; and he was a good-natur 'd Man in Company . Hen . Gobin . I live behind the Prisoner 's House . Between 2 and 3 in the Morning I heard a Noise , a Cry of Murder , and high Words , and then all was Calm again . And by and by I heard the Prisoner bemoan himself in a very piercing Way ; and then he call 'd out , Mary ! bring me a Fork or a Penknife ! Mary ! Mary ! for Jesus Sake , Mary ! What , will no Body come a near me ? O my God ! She 's dead ! She 's dead ! My poor dear Mother 's dead ! but I did not hear a Word of saying , I have murder 'd my Mother . Court . Can you take upon you to swear that you heard every Word , and were not in the same House ? Gobin . Yes , every Word . Court . How ? when you was behind the House , could you hear every Word that was spoke in the Kitchin ? Gobin . No ; I did not mean every Word , but I did not hear that Word . Mr. Hatchet . About 2 Years ago , I lodged a tweleve Month in the Prisoner 's House , and I saw no Misunderstanding betwixt him and his Mother , and he was a very honest Man , and his Conversation very Moral . Mary Philips . I have often heard the Deceased praise the Prisoner as the most dutiful Child that ever Woman had . She gave him the best of Characters , and said she was blest in a Son . - Bromly , a Sadler . I was Journeyman where the Prisoner was Prentice , he was a perfect sober young Man , he was continually reading good Books , he was guilty of no manner of Vice , neither Drinking , Whoring , Swearing , nor of any other Sin whatever . Will . Foster . This time was Twelvemonth the Deceased was at my House , and said she had been sick , and that her Son never left her Night nor Day , but continually sat by her Bed all the time , and cry 'd like a Child , without ceasing . Some of the Prisoner 's Witnesses having attempted to invalidate the Evidence of Mary Parrot , two Tradesmen of Reputation appear 'd to establish her Character . William Pempillion . I have known Mary Parrot about 7 Years , and she always bore the Character of a good , honest , sober Servant ; and I do n't believe she would swear wrongfully upon any Account whatever . James Prior . I have known her 7 Years or more , and she has all along been esteem 'd a sober , modest young Woman , I never heard that her Character had ever been stain 'd on any Account , and I am far from thinking that she could ever be prevail 'd with to take a false Oath . Prisoner . If the Jury should think that there was any Scuffle betwixt me nd my Mother , I hope they will consider there is a difference betwixt That and Malice . The Jury Acquitted the Prisoner , and found ( on the Coroner 's Inquisition ) that the Death of Ann Atkinson was Accidental . The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment , as follows : Receiv 'd Sentence of Death 8.
