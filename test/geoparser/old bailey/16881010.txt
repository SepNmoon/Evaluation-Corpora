William Ast of the Parish of St. Peter 's Paul's-Wharf , was Indicted for the Murther of one Thomas Raven , on the first day of August last , giving him one Mortal Wound near his right Eye , with a Hammer , value 6 d. of which he Died on the 29th . Instant , & c. The Evidence deposed that the Prisoner owned the striking of Raven ; But the Chirurgeon said that he might not Die so soon with the Blow , as he might by some irregularities in Drinking , or the like . The Prisoner called some Witnesses on his side , to prove that he did not strike the Deceased with the Hammer ; and they all said that the Prisoner had no Hammer , but that he struck him twice , and gave him but a kind of a little Scar near his right Eye . So upon a full Hearing , he was Acquitted . Nowell Gawell of the Parish of St. Botolph 's Aldgate ; was Indicted together with one Francis Freeman and two others as Accessories , not yet Taken , of Felony and Burglary , in Breaking the House of John Stone , on the 13th . of August last past , and taking thence ( in the Night about One a Clock , ) six Womens fine Shifts , value 6 l. two pair of Sheets , value 4 l. two Table-cloaths , value 10 s. two Dozen of Diaper Napkins , value 12 s. one Handkerchief , value 30 s. one pair of Lac 'd Ruffles , value 20 s. one Green Cloth Carpet , value 5 s. & c. The Evidence was Mrs. Stone and others ; who deposed that the Prisoner was a kind of a Labourer about the House ; and so might have opportunity to take away the abovesaid Goods ; some of which were left by him at an Ale house , near to Mr. Stone 's House . The Prisoner denied it , and said that the Goods were given him by another Man he met ; but they that were with him were Fled . He made no other Defence for himself ; and the Court looking upon himto be a kind of an Idle Fellow ; he was brought in guilty of the Felony , but Acquitted of the Burglary . Richard Jones of the Parish of St. Paul 's Covent-Garden , was Tryed for Killing one Thomas Jones a Chair-man , on the 17th . day of September last , with a Baggonet , value 6 d. giving him one Mortal Wound on the left side of his Body , of the length of one Inch , and of the depth of six Inches , & c. of which he immediately Died . The Evidence declared in the general , that the Prisoner was found going along Covent-Garden Plazza , Swearing that he would Kill the next Man he met , and was seen to pull his Baggonet from under his Coat , and thrust it into the Side of the Deceased Jones ; and then after he was taken and the Baggonet being produced , which he had dropt in his pursuit , he owned it to be his own , shaking his Head and Cursing Brandy and Women , & c. He had not much to say , but would have insinuated to the Court that the Deceased fell upon his Baggonet when they were Scuffling together ; yet the Jury found him guilty of willful Murther . [ Death . See summary . ] Henry Jeane of the Parish of St. Clement 's Danes Gent . and Ann Crisp , were Indicted , Jeane as Principal , and Crisp as Accessory , for willfully Murthering Samuel Moore , on the 20th . day of July in the Strand , at a House near the Thames side . It appeared upon the Evidence that the Prisoners being at the House of the Deceased at Anny-seed Cleer , there was a Quarrel arose between Moore and Mr. Jeane , and the Prisoner Crisp , about a Naked Bitch that the Deceased had of the Prisoners , which was lost ; and the Prisoners were heard to threaten the Deceased that they would have his Blood , or the like : Some time after the Prisoner Jeane and the Deceased happened to meet in the Strand , and there they Quarreled afresh , and Mr. Jeane was seen to give the Deceased one Mortal Wound , of the depth of seven Inches ; and that the Deceased was not seen to strike Mr. Jeane , & c. Although Mr. Jeane called several Witnesses , who declared that the Deceased and another Man a Black-a-More , were seen to strike Mr. Jeane the Prisoner several Blows , and that he stood and retired in his own Defence , being set upon by them as aforesaid . But Jeane had no Bruises nor Wounds about him to satisfie the Court that he was hurt : Besides the Chirurgeon declared in Court that the Deceased Died of the Wound that he received . So upon a very full and distinct hearing on both sides , Jeane was found guilty of Manslaughter , but the Woman was Acquitted . Richard Barber of the Parish of St. Clement 's Danes in the County of Middlesex ; was Tryed for Felony and Murther , in Killing Ann Stoner , Wife of William Stoner , on the 8th , day of August last , giving her 3 Mortal Wounds with a Pistol loaded with three Leaden Bullets , value 5 s. of the depth every one of them of eight Inches , of which she Died on the 9th . day of the same Month . The Evidence for the King declared that the Deceased and one or two more were going along Witch-street , and on a sudden a Pistol was Discharged , and the Deceased received the abovesaid Wounds , of which she fell down and cryed out : But the Evidence could not be positive that the Prisoner was the Person that Shot her ; only said that there was one on Horseback , and another on Foot went along the Street when the Deceased was Shot , and that the Prisoner said that he had no Malice against her after he was in Newgate ; and it was further deposed that the Prisoner removed his Goods and Lodging the same Night the Murther was committed , and could not be found for a considerable time after . The Prisoner denied that he knew any thing of the Death of the Woman , But did not deny , but that he was out on Horse-back in the Night in the Street ; and further said that he Fled , because he was afraid of Being Arrested , being much in Debt ; to prove which he called some Witnesses , but none could attest that he was any where else on the 8th . of August , but at the Place where the Murther was done . He said that he was at Ratcliffe , but could get none to prove it : Yet the Evidence being not able to prove that he Shot the Deceased , he was Acquitted by the Jury . Henry Howel and Mary Harris of the Parish of St. Clement 's Danes , in the County of Middlesex , were both Indicted for the Murther of one Richard Harris on the 26th . day of September last , giving him one Mortal Wound in his right Eye , of the depth of four Inches , & c. The Fray was thus ; the said Harris keeping a Brandy-shop , the Prisoner came in , and a Quarrel happened between them as they were Drinking , and that Howel was seen to Draw his Sword against Harris , and Swore that he would be the Death of him ; and said that he came to do Mischief , and within one Month he would be the Death of him the said Harris , with several other desperate Asseverations ; all which was confirmed against him by several of the King 's Evidence , but they did not Swear any thing against the Woman . The Prisoner said that the Deceased set upon him and Drew his Sword first , and called one Witness on his side , whose Evidence was not much prevailing on his behalf ; and although he urged the Court hard on his own part , yet the Court told him all he said signified nothing : So being Burnt in the Hand last Sessions for a Manslaughter , and being known to be an old Offender , and an idle Fellow , he was found guilty of Manslaughter : But no Evidence material appearing against the Woman , only that she had kept the said Howel Company , she was Acquitted . James Cary , alias Jefferyes , a Dutch Man , of the Parish of Stepney in the County of Middlesex , was Tryed for Robbing John Portlock , of 1 s. in Money , on the 11th . day of September last , in the King 's Highway . The Evidence was Portlock , who said that the Prisoner and another Person met him in the Night-time about Eleven a Clock , and bid him Stand and deliver his Money , and he having but 2 s. gave him one of them , which the Prisoner confessed before the Justice at his Apprehension by the Constable ; and that he spake so in English to the Constable , tho ' he pretended he could not speak it at his Tryal , but an Interpreter was Sworn on the Prisoner 's account . Another Evidence said against him that he Fled when he was Pursued : he did not deny the Fact , but said that his Companion had taken the Shilling ; and the Evidence all concurred that he spake English . The Interpreter told him the sence of what was Swore against him , which he could not deny ; so he was found Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] William Savadge a Soldier , of the Parish of St. Andrew 's Holbourn , in the County of Middlesex , was Indicted for Picking the Pocket of one Prudence Cannell , Wife of Mr. Edward Cannell , of one Purse , value 6 d. and 4 s. in Money , on the 7th . day of October . The Evidence was Mrs. Cannell and others , who declared that as she was coming along Southhampton Buildings , the Prisoner and another Justledher , and she lost her Money ; but she did not Swear positively that he was the Man that Robb 'd her ; but other Evidence proved him to be the Person . The Prisoner had little to say for himself , and being known to have been an old Offender , and having no Witness on his side , he was found Guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] Josias Best , Doctor of Physick , was Indicted and Tryed for High-Treason , in Clipping and Coyning of Money , the last Fact being done about January last , viz . forty Pieces of King Charles the First 's Shillings , and forty other Pieces of the King 's Coin called Half Crowns , with certain Sheers and other Instruments fit for the purpose , diminishing from each Piece the value of 2 d. The Counsel for the King opened the Cause to the Jury , and called some Witnesses against the Prisoner , the chief of which was Stephen Bayley , who was taken on the First of May last in Red-lyon Fields , who said that he had been a Dealer with him , and that he had known him to have Clipp 'd Money several times , and to change Broad Money for Clipp 'd , at the rate of 1 s. 6 d. advantage in the Pound ; and several Filings and other Pieces of Silver were found in his Custody when he was Taken ; and Bayley further said that he had bought several Lumps of Silver of the Prisoner , and that he owned them to be of his own doing and Clipping ; and that the Lumps were of the value of about 40 or 50 s. and that he confessed to Bayley further , that he got about 100 l. peranum by it : All which was very fully and strenuously Evidenced against him , & c. Thus far was the Evidence for the King against him . But the Prisoner would perswade the Court that he never , knew any thing of what was charged against him , and denied all the matter of Fact , and argued very weakly in his own Defence . Whilest he was Trying , the Court ordered Mr. Massey and some others to go to one Turner 's in Milk-street where he had lately Lodged , where was found two bits of Silver in the Closet , and some Filings were seen upon the Ground , and a Hole made in the Wall , and the Room left in a kind of a Suspicious sort ; all which was additionally Sworn against him ; but he denied it all , and stood as it were one Stupified , having nothing material to offer for himself . So upon a very full and clear Hearing on both sides , he was at last brought in not Guilty ; but yet was ordered to prepare very good Sureties , ( at least 300 l. each ) for his good Behaviour for the time to come . Robert Benneson of the Parish of Christ's-Church , was Tryed for Stealing from William Normavill on the 8th , of October , two silver Tankards , value 15 l. two silver Porringers , value 7 l.

He was a Second time Indicted for procuring Sheers and other Instruments fit for Clipping into his Custody , and for having Clipp 'd Money about him , intending to put it off , on purpose to Cheat and Deceive the King 's Majesties Subjects of this Kingdom of England , & c. The Prisoner told the Court that he never had any Clipt Money in his Custody to put off for any private Advantage , & c. And said further that any Person might have Clipt Money about him , and do no harm with it : So the Jury acquitted him of the Misdemeanor ; but withal the Court ordered him to find good Sureties for his good Behaviour for the future .
