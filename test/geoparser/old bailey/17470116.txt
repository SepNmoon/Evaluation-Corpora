Oct. 28 . Court to John Marlow . Give an Account of what you know of the Fact the Prisoner is charged with . Marlow . Please you , my Lord , I was in the House some Time . Court . First tell the Time and Place . Marlow . 'T is at the Sign of the Three-Tuns in Ayloff-street , Goodmans-fields . On the 28th of October I was in the House ; the deceased went down to draw me half a Pint of Twopenny ; while he was gone for the Beer , his Wife went backward ; whilst she was gone backward , he brought the half Pint of Twopenny ; I was standing with my Back to the Fire ; the deceased , he went backward also , and in about four or five Minutes Time , I heard the Cry of Murder ; it was a Woman 's Voice , and I thought it to be the Prisoner at the Bar : There was a Man that was in Company with me , that I believe to be fuddled , he started up immediately at the Cry of Murder ! Q . Is that Man here ? Marlow . No , my Lord ; when the deceased had been gone backward about the Space of four or five Minutes , he came back in his Shirt ; he came towards me , and went up three or four Stairs , and put his Hand upon the Banister , he turns his Face round to me , and says , my Wife has stabbed , killed , or murdered me , one of these three things he said , but which I ca n't positively say . He turned to me , and showed me his Back , the upper Part of his Back was all bloody . Q . Did you see the Wound ? Marlow . No , my Lord , he being at some Distance from me , he turned his Back again , and went up Stairs . I was in a great Surprize ; I drank the remaining Part of my half Pint of Twopenny , and came out of the House ; when I came away , coming out of Doors , not seeing the deceased 's Wife , nor knowing which way she came by me , I thought she might be backward ; but when I had gone about five or six Yards from the Door , I saw the deceased 's Wife , the Prisoner , I heard her cry out , That she had murdered or stabbed her Husband . Q . To what Purpose did she make that Exclamation ? Marlow . I suppose she went to call a Surgeon . I was reading the News-paper , and she might get by me . I did not think she was gone out of the House , I thought she had been with the Man that went up on the crying of Murder . When I came out , I saw several Women with her , up in Arms as it were . Q . Have you any thing more to say ? Marlow . Nothing more , my Lord , that is the Truth I can stand too . Court to George Gowry . Give an Account of this Matter . Gowry . Upon the 28th of October , between twelve and one o'Clock in the Afternoon , this Prisoner at the Bar called me , and told me she had stabbed and murdered her Husband , and desired I would come to his Assistance ; when I came there , I found him standing upon the Floor . Q . Was he above Stairs or below ? Gowry . I found him below Stairs , standing upon the Floor with a Knife in his Hand , and he told me that was the Knife that his Wife stabbed him with , he desired me that I would take care of it ; immediately he went up Stairs , and desired me to come after him , which I did ; when I came there , I examined the Wound slightly , and found it was very dangerous . I stopped the bleeding , in order to get a proper Surgeon to my Assistance . Court . Describe the Wound . Gowry . The Wound was under the Right-Shoulder , between the 5th and 6th Rib . Q . How deep was the Wound ? Gowry . I could not justly tell then , but it appeared since about five Inches . Q . What have you further to say ? Gowry . I have nothing further , but I went for a Surgeon to my Assistance , but when I came back , I did not do any thing . - Harrison , Surgeon . My Lord , I was called to this Place by Mr Gowry , in Whitechapel ; when I came , I found the Wound as it has been described . I suppose the Wound must have been made with a Sort of a Butcher 's Knife , of a short , sharp , broad Point ; I discovered at the first , that the Wound had penetrated the Thorax . Q . When did the Man die ? Harrison . Two Days after . Q . Do you suppose that the Wound was the Occasion of his Death ? Harrison . Yes , Sir . - Green . I was desired to inspect the Body of the deceased ; upon viewing the Body , there was a Wound just under the Right-Shoulder , between the fifth and sixth Rib , entirely close to the Back-bone ; upon opening the Body , the Cavity , that Part of the Thorax , was quite full of Blood , as if forced into it by a Syringe . Court . I suppose you are of Opinion this Wound was the Occasion of his Death . Green . Yes , Sir . Court . Prisoner , now is your Time to enter upon your Defence . Prisoner . Two Men came in , and they drank several Pints of Twopenny , and several Drams : At length one of them began to be pretty much in Liquor ; upon which my Husband said , Is Dinner ready ? I went to take it up ; it was in the Wash-house , which went down three Steps , my Husband went to draw some Twopenny , and my Husband saw the other Man talk to me , and he said to him , What Business have you to talk to my Wife ? and he struck the Man ; I had a Knife and Fork in my Hand , and they in struggling threw me down , and fell upon me , and he said , O Lord , I am killed ! With that I went out of Doors to get a Surgeon to dress him , and to see what ailed him . Court . Repeat what you said of the Knife and Fork in your Hand ? Prisoner . I was taking up a Piece of Beef and Cabbage for Dinner ; while the Man was talking with me , my Husband came up out of the Cellar , and he asked the man , What Business he had to talk to his Wife ? With that he struck the Man , and the Place being narrow , in the Struggle I fell , he fell down , and the Knife fell into his Back . Q . Where is that Man that your Husband struggled with ? Prisoner . I do not know , Sir ; I thought he would have been here , I did expect him ; he said he would be here . Q. to the first Witness . John Marlow , do you know this back Yard ? Marlow . I do not know any Thing of the Matter . Q . What Account did the deceased give ? Marlow . My Lord , I told you he turned about upon the Stairs , and said his Wife had killed him . Q . Did you not ask him ? Marlow . My Lord , I was frightened that such an Accident should happen while I was in the House , so I drank my Twopenny , and went out . Q . Did you see any other Man there ? Marlow . The Man she speaks of went into the House along with me . Court . There was a Person sitting you thought was in Liquor , did that Man go back before the Cry of Murder , or afterwards ? Did any Person in the Room go back before the Cry of Murder ? Marlow . No , my Lord , not to my Knowledge . Q. to Christopher Boswell . What have you to say to this Matter ? Boswell . My Lord , I am Brother to the deceased , I was told the Tuesday Night before my Lord-Mayor 's Day , that my Brother was murdered . I goes down directly to the House ; when I came , I asked how Harry did , the Prisoner said , you may go up and see ; when I went up , he was lying like a Man dead , groaning . I asked whether he thought he should recover , he told me he could not tell ; so with that he looked at his Wife , and he says , if it was not for you , we might have been in our Beds , as we ought to have been ; so he , looking at his Wife , says , you have done a fine Thing to laugh at . Court . I hope she did not laugh at that Time ? Boswell . I can not tell . I did not look at her Face ; with that the Prisoner at the Bar went down Stairs , and her Mother in-Law desired me to follow her , that she might not do any Damage to herself . I followed her , and found her by the Fire-side in the Fore room , and said , Nanny , What do you sit here for ? I said , Nanny , How could you be so barbarous to butcher one that you liked so well ? Why , says she , it was through a Woman that came into the House , that told me he had been along with some fresh Women that came into this Neighbourhood . I says to her , Who was that Woman that came and told you so ? She said it was wooden-legged Peg ; I said wooden-legged Peg says the same of you , and can not you forgive him , as well as he forgives you ; with that she made no Reply , but went up Stairs where the deceased lay . Q . Did you follow her ? Boswell . Yes , my Lord . Q . What past then ? Boswell . Nothing farther . I went the Night following to see him , and the House was open , and the Prisoner at the Bar as usual serving of Customers ; I went in and asked her how her Husband did , she gave me a Candle , and said I might go up and see ; I asked him how he did , he said he hoped he was better ; that is all that I know . Magnus Latham . The deceased , my Lord , worked for me ; I happened to be in the House , some Words arose at the Table , she said she should die for him , and she threw a Knife and Fork at him . Q . When was this ? Latham . The Day of the Month I can not tell . Q . Was it the Day he was killed ? Latham . No , my Lord , it was a considerable Time ago . Q . What do you imagine to be the Cause of it ? Latham . I imagine something of Jealously between them . Q . What were the Words that passed between them ? Latham . She believed she should die for him ; when she threw the Knife and Fork at him , he was obliged to screen himself . Q . Was there some Heat and Anger when the Knife and Fork was thrown ? Latham . My Lord , I can not tell the beginning of all of it ; there was a Cooper came in , and they went to play a Game at Mississippi , and she got a little in Liquor , but her Husband pacified her . After she had thrown the Knife and Fork , he persuaded her to go to Bed ; he went up with her to put her to Bed , at Night she came down in good Order , and very loving seemingly , as they ought to be . Q . What Time was it that she went to Bed ? Latham . I believe about two o'Clock , or thereabouts . Q. to Mary Hurst . What have you to say in the Behalf of the Prisoner at the Bar ? Hurst . I had been out about some Business : when I came Home , I heard a great Misfortune had happened between Mr Boswell and his Wife . I heard she had done Mischief to her Husband ; when I came into the House , I saw the Prisoner at the Bar ; I shook my Head at her , and said nothing when I came in , but saw her crying and ringing her Hands about the Room . I could not speak to her at that Time , neither did I go up and see the Man at that Time , till Mr Green and Mr Gowry came . I then went up , and held the Bason while he was bleeding : when Mr Green came down , she asked after her Husband , then he asked for his Fee , upon that the Prisoner took a Guinea out of her Pocket , and gave it to him ; and when I came down , the Prisoner was standing at the Foot of the Stairs , ringing her Hands , and asked me how her Husband did , I told her I had not spoke to him yet ; I told her I would have her go up , she said she would not : I shook my Head at her , then I went up and asked him how he did ; he said , as well as he could expect : I said , Mr Boswell 't is a sad thing to see such Differences between your Wife and you , be reconciled to your Wife , and see her ; says he , let her come up , I owe her no ill Will , 't is as much my Fault as her 's . Q . When he said it was as much his Fault as his Wife 's , did he give an Account of what happened ? Hurst . No , my Lord , he desired I would go down and look to the House , while she came up , which she did , but what they said , I can not tell . I came the next Morning , and asked her how her Husband did , she desired me to go up ; she asked for a Nurse that might be a careful Woman of him , but the Person that was recommended , asked too much Money , he said they could not afford it . Mary Holywright . I lived a Servant in the House ; at the Time I lived with them , they lived in Love and Unity . I have been come away twelve Months last Michaelmas . Q . How long did you live there ? Holywright . Above a Quarter of a Year : there was Love and Harmony between them , it was nothing but Harry and Nanny , & c. Elizabeth Lyons . The deceased and the Prisoner were Lodgers to me before they went to House-keeping ; they lodged with me together four Months . I saw nothing but that they lived together in Love and Unity ; she went out to Ironing , and him to work Journey-work , that was about three or four Years ago ; that is all I have to say . John Brawley . All that I can say , she lived a Servant with my Father about eight Years ago , and behaved extremely well . I have served the Prisoner at the Bar with Drink since they have kept a publick House ; I have been up and down at the House , and I have seen them sociable together , as other People are . Guilty , Death . 69 . + Mary Allen , otherwise Smith , was indicted for stealing three Pair of Worsted Stockings out of the Shop of John Wilson , value 10 s. The first Witness to prove this Fact upon the Prisoner , was Mr Wilson 's Servant , William Mason , he first saw the Prisoner put the Stockings into her Pocket-Apron ; he let her step out of the Shop , then nodded to his Master to come immediately , and called her back , but she would not come ; so Mr Wilson brought her back to his Shop himself , and took them from her , and said to her , Now are you not satisfied you are a Thief ? She then said , they were pushed into her Apron ; he replied , no , I believe they were drawn in ; so he sent for the Constable , she fell upon her Knees , and begged for Forgiveness , and said it was the first Fact . Guilty of Felony , to the value 4 s. 10 d. 70 . +Mary Allen , otherwise Smith , was a second Time indicted for privately stealing eight Yards of Chints Lawn Gown out of the Shop of George Riston , and his Property , the 25th of August . Q. to John Riston . Do you know the Prisoner ? Riston . I only remember seeing her in the Shop . On the 25th of August last , she came to ask for some Handkerchiefs , I shewed her several Sorts of Silk and Linnen ; she asked the Price , I told her the lowest Price . She said she sold a pretty many , but what she sold was in Gentlemens Families ; she said her Sister kept a Shop the Bottom of St Martin's-Lane , she said if we used her well , she would be a very good Customer . She desired I would bring the Silk Handkerchiefs the next Day to her Sister 's House , and if I could get her the same of them Silk Handkerchiefs , she would have a Piece . I said to the Boy , Has not this Woman stole something . I do not like her leaning over so . I asked for the Chints Lawn , so we missed it . The next Day I said I would take the two Handkerchiefs to the Place where she said her Sister lived ; I went , and asked the Gentlewoman if her Sister was within , so she said she did not know what I meant ; then I went back and told my Brother , that I thought it was a Bite . Q . When was the first Time that you heard of this Chints ? Riston . The 27th of December last , Mr Wilson heard that we had lost a Chints Gown , and there was that and all Sorts of Linnen-drapery Goods at her Lodgings ; there was the Piece of Chints Lawn , I know the Piece perfectly well , there is my own Hand-writing on it , I gave a Description , as marked with a red Pencil , before I saw it . - Bilby . The Prisoner lodged in Park street with me , Mr Kenton and she was there together as Man and Wife . Q . Were they Man and Wife ? Bilby . That I can not tell , she went by the Name of his Wife . Q . Who paid the Rent ? Bilby . Mr Kenton . Q . Who claimed a Property in the Goods that were found in Mr Kenton 's Room ? Bilby . After Kenton found his Wife was taken up , he then said he was not married to her , he acknowledged before the Justice she was not his Wife , and that he had no Right to the Things , that they were not his . The Prisoner at the Bar claimed the Goods in the Room as her Property , before she was convicted : accordingly the Key was delivered to her as a Person that had the Property of those Goods , some of which Goods , besides the Chints , was claimed in Court by others . The Prisoner was found guilty of the Indictment . Death . [ There were several other Indictments against the Prisoner , but the Court did not think fit to try her on any other . ] 71.

It was the Day after Christmas-day . Q . Where was this ? Davis . It was at the House of one Thomas Dobson ; it was in the Back-lane by Rosemary-Lane , she asked me to drink a Dram , I said you are not worth a Dram , you are so old .

Q . What was it he brought up his Boat for ? Mellard . For to take the Rope in , I saw him take in some . Q . Where did he take it from ? Mellard .

I went into my Room again about five o'Clock in the Evening ; my Room was all safe as I left it , as I thought ; about half an Hour after 11 o'Clock , I saw a Pane of the Glass out , with that I was sure in my Mind my Money and Rings were gone ; I went to seek for the Money and Rings , and they were gone . I went down , and there was Company in the House , and I told my Friends of it ; they said they were very sorry ; they said they would be searched , and they said if any Body was a Bed they should be searched ; for they said it is a Friend that has your Money ; there was the Prisoner and another in Bed ; one of them throws out his Breeches to me , I searched his Pockets ; so when we came to Joseph Belcher , the Prisoner , I asked him what money he had , he said only Half a Crown and Three-half-pence ; he was very unwilling to part from his Breeches : we sent for the Constable , when he came , he said to him , you must go along with me , and he said , Where to ? the Constable answered , to the Compter ; when he went to put his Breeches on , the Constable said , he must see what was in his Pockets , and he took out ten Guineas , and he searched in another Pocket and found the two Rings that I had but a little Time before , with that he was committed to the Compter .

Yes , my Lord , in October last , between 12 and 1 o'Clock in the Morning , the Man came to me , and asked me whether I could not take the Charge of a Man for a Suspicion of Robbery ; so I went to the House , and up Stairs along with him , so we knocked at the Door ; the Prisoner at last came out of Bed , and let us in ; he said he would charge me with a Suspicion of Robbery , he was unwilling we should search his Breeches ; I had a Suspicion the Money was there . I found Half a Crown in his Pocket ; I searched his Fob , and found 10 Guineas and an Half , and two Half Crowns , and 3 s. and two Gold Rings . Q . Did Walker lay claim to them ? Dunn . Yes , Sir . Q . What did the Prisoner say ? Dunn . He seemed to be vex 'd that he had done it ; but he said he took it for Fun , and designed to give it him again . Q. to the Prisoner . What have you to say for yourself ? Prisoner . My Lord , when I took it first , I only took it as a Joke , only to make him take more Care of it another Time . Q. to Mr Chitty . Sir , Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Chitty . The Prisoner at the Bar , Joseph Belcher , was my Servant about nine Months ; he lived with me at the Time when I found he was guilty of the unhappy Accident : during the Time that he lived with me , he behaved himself soberly and honestly ; when I heard of this Accident , I was surprized ; I am afraid 't is very hard against him ; his Family I am told is a reputable Family . Bowler Miller . The Prisoner , Belcher , lived with me , and a very sober honest Lad he was . The Prisoner used to come frequently to see his Brother ; we had a pretty deal of Plate in our House , and I never missed any thing . I believe him to be a very honest Man . The Defence the Prisoner made , that he did it out of a Jest . This , together with the good Character he bore , induced the Jury not to find him guilty . Acquitted . 76.

Clark and Saunders being at my House that same Night , I enquired after Saunders , but could not find him : Some Time afterwards , I saw an Advertisment that the Silver Spoons and Salts were stopped at Mr Lloyd 's in Smithfield ; I went to Mr Lloyd 's , and desired to see the Plate that was stopped , after a little Examination , he gave me a Sight of the Plate ; Mr Lloyd did not know the Persons that left the Goods at his House , but he remembered Sparks , Saunders , and Howse so particularly , that he described them to me .

The next Day Howse was taken up , and sent to New-Prison ; after they were carried into Prison , they were willing to make Discoveries ; I asked Sparks whether he knew of the Remainder of the Plate .

I asked him what he would have an Ounce , he asked me 5 s. which was about the Mark ; then he pulled out a Salt , which gave me a Suspicion : Says I , young Man , as you are a Butcher , I suppose you are known here ; we never buy any thing of Persons we do not know . I went with him to the Lock and Key ; coming into a Room , Sparks says to a Person , You know me , do n't you ? I said to the Person , Sir , this is a serious Matter , you will be cautious , this is about some Plate being stopped ; the Person then said , he did not know him . While they were talking , two other Men came up . I can not say that Howse was one of them . At the Time the Man disowned him , immediately Sparks and the other two pushed off ; I came Home and told my Wife , these young Fellows have stole the Plate , I said I would advertise it : Upon advertising it , Mr Dugard came to me ; I told him he must give some Account of them ; he told me , he lived in Mark-lane , and kept a House at Winchmore-hill . I told Mr Dugard , I believed I could describe them , if he had any loose Men his Way , which I did ; he begged of me that I would assist him to go down in the Country , and he would send for two Horses ; I told him I would . We went down on Saturday Night , on Sunday Morning we went in Pursuit after them ; accordingly Sparks was first taken up . When I saw the young Man , I said to him , 'T is a pretty while since you came to Smithfield , but you are the Man . We carried him before the Justice , but he still denied every thing . The next Day Howse was taken up , and he caused Nick Saunders to be apprehended , but he made his Escape ; whereupon Howse was commited for not keeping the Man . When I went to them to New-Prison , they confessed the Things ; I said , where can I get them , they directed me to Sarah King ; when I came to her , she said , I thank God I know nothing of the Matter , I will wash my Hands of all such Fellows ; I thought there was something the Matter ; I said to her , you must go with us ; she says , by G - d I will not go ; I says , Madam , you must go ; she then cried , and said , they gave them to her . She went along with us to three Pawnbrokers , one in Goswell-street , another in Barbican , and the other in Playhouse yard ; she said that Sparks and Howse went with her to pawn them . Thomas Goss . These Buckles , pawned by Howse , I have cleaned several Times , and they are my Master Dugard 's Buckles .

George Brown and Robert Savcrey were indicted for stealing one Mortar , and a Brass Pestle , value 2 s. 6 d. the Goods of Mary Roberson . Martha Wimpey . On the first of January , both the Prisoners came in and sat themselves down in the middle Box , in that Room facing the Chimney-Place where the Brass Pestle and Mortar stood . - Jennings . I thought I heard something of a Chinking , and hinted something to Richard Jennings , he went up to the Table , and insisted upon knowing what they had there ; there was something wrapped up in a coarse thing , which was a Piece of a Frock , Jennings laid hold of George Brown , and likewise of the Frock , wherein was something tied up ; he insisted upon seeing what it was ; when it came to be opened , it was the Brass Pestle and Mortar which belonged to Mrs Roberson . Richard Jennings . Both the Prisoners came into Mrs Roberson 's House ; Saverey . the Prisoner , in a Soldier 's Coat , he came from the Box where he sat , to the Chimney-side , where the Pestle and Mortar stood ; he came under a Pretence to toast a Piece of Cheese , which he put upon a Pen-knife in order to toast it . I did not like the Looks of the Men , therefore I had the Curiosity to see if they had any thing : the Things wrapped up were opposite to Brown , I declared I would see what was in it ; upon that , Saverey got up and gave me a Blow ; however , I held them both as long as I could ; being sturdy Men , I could not manage them both ; upon that the Girl came up , Martha Wimpey , she laid hold of the Skirt of his Coat ; upon laying hold of his Coat , he stabbed her in the Elbow ; upon this he made his Escape ; However , this did not make me let go the Prisoner Brown , but Brown dragged me out to the Door : when I got out upon advanced Ground , I knocked Brown down , and he said I had broke his Jaw ; the Parcel being opened , the Pestle and Mortar was there , which I can swear to be Mrs Roberson 's . Before they came into the House , there was no such thing as a Piece of Frock lying there . Q. to Samuel Foster . Do you know either of t he Prisoners at the Bar ? Foster .

He being a pretty resolute Man , we let him alone till the Morning , then we got a Warrant for him , and took him up , and he confessed it before the Justice , and afterwards . William Cross . On Saturday before Christmas-day , Mr Heyman , my Neighbour , sent for me to a publick House , and said he believed he was robbed by some of his Servants , and we marked Money , we marked three Six-pences , and a Brass Six-pence , which I marked myself with a Pen-knife . Q . Did you look into the Till , and see what was missing ? Cross . I sat up that Time along with my Neighbour , I saw him heave the Till up , and take something out , which I believe was Money . Q . How did the Prisoner open the Till ? Cross . He listed it up with his Hand , I would have seized him , but Mr Heyman believed he would spoil his Batch of Bread , which was just about to be put in ; we ordered the Constable to search him , and he found 3 l. in Silver , and three Guineas , with that he owned the whole , and said he was guilty . Q . What did he say , did he own he had done it ? Cross . He said his Master might take all the Money , and he would go into the Country . When I first charged him with robbing his Master , he said he did not rob him , till I told him of the marked Money .

He likewise stood charged upon the Coroner 's Inquisition with Man slaughter . Q. to John Jennings . What have you to say of William Turner about driving the Cart , & c. Jennings . As I was sitting at work , I heard a great Noise , and I espies a Cart come a full Trot , a Cart , or Dray , or something , and about four Yards off , where I sat at work , I saw the Fore-Horse come and fling the deceased down ; after he had slung her down , the near Wheel ran over her Head .

Q . Was the Cart loaded or empty ? Dunn . I perceived some Baskets in it . Daniel Stephens confirmed the above Evidence . Court to the Prisoner . What do you say for yourself ? Prisoner . As I was going down the Minories , I met a Dray or two , I was forced to leave the Horse 's Head , or I should have been squeezed myself , that I let go my Hold to keep off the Dray ; there was a young Horse before . William Harris and Francis Allen knew the Prisoner four or five Years , and never knew any Harm of him . As the Prisoner was under some Difficulty in meeting other Drays , the Court thought it ought not to be brought in Manslaughter , but accidental , therefore he was acquitted of the Murder and Manslaughter . 103 . + Hugh Pelling , of the Parish of St Martin Outwich , in the Ward of Broad-street , London , Gent . was indicted for feloniously forging a certain Warrant , or Order , to defraud the Governor and Company of Merchants of Great Britain , trading to the South-Seas , & c. and for publishing the same , knowing it to be forged .

THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE KING 'S Commissions of the PEACE , and Oyer and Terminer , HELD FOR THE CITY of LONDON , AND County of MIDDLESEX , AT JUSTICE-HALL in the Old-Baily , on FRIDAY January 16 , SATURDAY 17 , and MONDAY 19 . In the 20th Year of His MAJESTY 'S Reign . BEING THE Second SESSIONS in the MAYORALTY OF THE Right Honourable William Benn , Esq ; LORD-MAYOR of the CITY of LONDON . NUMBER II . PART II . LONDON : Printed for J. HINTON , at the King's-Arms in St Paul 's Church-Yard . 1746 . [ Price Six-pence . ] The Continuation of the Trial of Hugh Pelling . UPON reading the Indictment , the Council for the Prisoner objected , that an Intention to defraud a Body Corporate , was not within the Meaning of the Act of Parliament of the Seventh of His Present Majesty , which declares it Felony , falsely to make , forge , or counterfeit , any Acquittance or Receipt , for Payment of Money ; or knowingly to utter or publish the same , with Intention to defraud any Person whatsoever : That the South-Sea Company can not fall under the general Description of the Word Person , mentioned in this Act . [ Which Point was reserved to the Prisoner , in Case he had been found guilty . And then the Council for the King proceeded . ] That the Prisoner was now called upon to answer for his Life for an Offence of a dangerous Tendency , an Offence that the Law has made capital , the forging of a Dividend-Warrant in order to defraud the South-Sea Company . The Prisoner was one of the Clerks of the South-Sea House , in an Office called the Pay-Office , and they make their Payments in Consequence of Warrants brought to them for that Purpose ; these Warrants are brought by the Proprietors , or Persons for them , into the Treasury , the Method of which is as follows : The Cashier in a Morning pays into the Hands of the Pay-Clerks a certain Sum of Money ; if in the Evening they bring Warrants importing the Sum delivered to them , he ballances the Account that Day with proper Vouchers ; if they do not bring Warrants to the Amount of the Sum received , they are to return so much of the Money as has not been applied in Payments . The Fact for which the Prisoner is charged , is the altering of a Dividend-Warrant , by adding the Letter y to the Word Eight , to make it Eighty , and by the Addition of a Cypher to the Sum 8 l. to make it 80 l. and the Addition of a Cypher to 400 l. to make it 4000 l. which Alterations are an uniform Multiplication by 10 . The Fact laid in the Indictment is so long ago as February was a Twelve-month , and the Discovery was made no longer ago than October last . In the Month of February , 1744 . Mr William Derisley , whose Name is mentioned in the Warrant , being intitled to the Sum of 400 l. South-Sea Annuities , applied about the first of that Month , the Dividend-Warrants being then payable , in order to receive his Dividend , he went to the proper Office in order to make his Claim . When the Accounts are stated , how much is due to every Proprietor ; then Warrants are made out , and these Warrants are numbered , importing to be payable for Dividends upon New South-Sea Annuities , viz . L. Rowland Rogers , Esq ; Pay the Sum of on L . New South-Sea Annuities , & c. and there is a Blank left in the printed Paper , to be filled up with the Name and Figures ; so that when any of the Properietors apply for a Warrant , in order to receive their Dividend , there is an Alphabet ready to have Recourse to Names , upon which Mr Derisley having applied , he thought it proper to go to the Pay Office ; at the Time he received the Warrant , he signed his Name on the Back of it ; upon the Receipt of the Money , as is usually done ; the Money he applied for was 8 l. which he received , and left the Warrant in the Office , and heard no more of it , till he was applied to , to unravel this Affair ; being called upon to give an Account of this Transaction ; to the best of his Knowledge , he thinks it to be the First of February , which Warrant was not brought in to the Cashier 's Office , till the 11th of February , then it was brought in , in the same Manner as the Clerks usually bring in their Warrants as Vouchers , which Warrants were bundled together , and the Number and Value wrote upon the Outside ; and the Clerk generally writes his Name at Length , or the initial Letters of his Name upon it ; and the Prisoner at the Bar , on the 11th of February aforesaid , thought sit , upon the Bundle he carried in , to write his Name at Length , importing it to contain One Hundred fifty five Warrants , the Cashier not checking it immediately , they put the Sum , that is the Amount of that Bundle , which was L . 2806 12 s. 6 d. the whole Amount of the 155 Warrants . Under these Circumstances , 't is apprehended that there is all the Proof that can be of an Attempt to defraud the South-Sea Company , by which Warrant , if it had stood unimpeached , the Prisoner would have gained to himself Seventy-two Pounds . Q. to Daniel Hayne . Are you a Clerk belonging to the South-Sea Company ? Hayne . I am , Sir . Q . Was you so in February 1744 ? Hayne . Yes , Sir . Q . In what Office ? Hayne . In the Transfer Office . Q . Are you the Person that makes out the Dividend-Warrants ? What Warrant is that you have in your Hand ? What No Warrant ? Hayne . 1214 . Q . Was that Warrant made out by you ? Hayne . Wrote by me , and signed by me . Q . At the Time when that Note was wrote by you , and signed by you , what Sum was it ? Hayne . I have compared it with the Dividend-Book , it was 400 l. Stock , and 8 l. carried in the Margin , was for the Dividend thereof . Q . From whence is this Dividend Warrant drawn ? Hayne . They are wrote from our Dividend-Book , and that is in the Dividend-Book . Q . What is it there ? Hayne . The Dividend-Book expresses Eight Pounds on 400 l. Stock , the Warrant is for William Derisley . Q . Was this Warrant made out from that Book ? Is that Entry of your writing in that Book , or from the Book of another Year ? Hayne . It was from this Book , or a Copy from another . Q . Can you take upon yourself to swear that Warrant was made from that Book ? Hayne . Yes . Council for the Defendant . This Warrant before you , is it of your writing ? Hayne . Yes , Sir . Council . Is it as you wrote it , or has there been an Alteration made in it ? Hayne . I am satisfied there is an Alteration . Q . How was it when you wrote it ? Hayne . It was Eight for the Interest , and the Principal 400 l. Court . Be so good as to read it as you wrote it . Hayne . Rowland Rogers , Esq ; Pay to Wm Derisley the Sum of Eight Pounds on 400 l. Stock . It is now Eighty by the Addition of the y . Council . Are you sure that the y is not of your writing ? Hayne . It was not . Q . Does it stand as you first wrote it , the Sum of 400 l. ? Hayne . No , it is now 4000 . Council . How was 400 expressed ? Hayne . First it was expressed in Figures , 400 l. there is the Mark of Pounds , an L. Q . How is it now ? Hayne . It is the same with the Addition of an o ; what was before 400 , is now 4000 . Council . Give me Leave to ask you again , first , Is the Figures 400 your own Hand-writing ? Hayne . Yes , the 400 ; but with regard to the last Cypher , that makes it 4000 , I take it not , because it does not stand in Course with the rest . Council . Have you any other Reason , with regard to the Figures 4000 l or what Reason have you with regard to the Letter y added to the Eight , of being sure , or being of an Opinion , that the y and Cypher is not your Hand-writing ? Hayne . Sir , the y is quite different to what I write , and crowded more than I should have cared to have done in a Warrant . Council . Now with Regard to the additional o , that follows in the Sum 400 , What Reason have you besides what you gave ? You said the last o was out of the Line ; What Reason have you besides being out of the Line ? Hayne . The Manner of the o is different . Council . Now I would add , whether you have taken any Notice of the Figures in the Margin ? Hayne . I ca n't be quite so positive as to the o in the Margin , as the o in the 400 . Council . Do you know whose Hand-writing was the Figure of 8 ? Hayne . Mine , Sir . Council So then you not only filled up the Warrant , but put in the Figures ? Hayne . Yes , Sir , we have examined this Warrant after it was wrote , three several Times ; Mr Fowler and I both examined it and signed it . Council . Are you positive you examined the Import of the Warrant before you signed it ? Hayne . Yes , Sir . Council . What did you examine it by ? Hayne . I believe by this Book . Council . What Reason have you to take it to be this Book ? Hayne . Because this is the Book by which we pay . Q . In whose Custody is this Book ? Hayne . 'T is in the Custody of him that belongs to the Book , and takes Care of the Key . Council . Are you one of the Officers ? Hayne . No . Council . Are you sure that Book has not been altered since ? Hayne . Sir , 't is plain here 's no Alteration in it . Council . Why do you say that the Book to pay by is part of the Book to pay by ? Hayne . This Book takes in all in D. Council . Do you generally examine by this Book that you call the Pay-Book ? Hayne . I rarely miss . Council . Have you any other Reason ? Hayne . 'T is my general Practice ; and I look upon it to be safest for the Company . Council . So then by the Form of the Letter y , and the Form of that last Cypher , you think 't is not your Hand-writing ? Hayne . I am sure of it . Council . What Reason have you to think that the o in the Margin is not your writing ? Hayne . I compared those Sums together from this Book , and had it been 80 , it would not have agreed with this book . Q . What is the use of making Figures in the Margin ? Hayne . I look upon it to be more ready for the Payment of Interest . Q . Do you ever make the Sum in the Margin different from the Body of the Warrant ? Hayne . We write in the Body of the Warrant the Words at Length , and the Margin in Figures . Q . Did you ever make out a Warrant of Eight Pounds for Mr Derisley ? Hayne . Yes . Council . Can you tell at what Time of the Year you make out these Warrants ? Hayne . We fill them up half yearly . Council . Can you recollect between the Time of shutting and opening the Books , that that Warrant was not , or could not be , actually taken out ? Q . After you have wrote it , to whom do you deliver it ? Hayne . I generally examine the last Examination but very little before delivering our Warrants . Q . Who is the other Officer to whom you deliver them ? Hayne . There is one Fenboulhet under me . Council Can you recollect after you had compleated that Warrant to be delivered into the Hands of the Clerk , who that Clerk was to whom it was delivered ? Hayne . I ca n't say to whom it was delivered . Council . Nor you do n't know where it was during all that Time ? Hayne . It was in our Custody all that Time . Council . Did any Body keep the Key of that Box where it was ? Hayne . Yes . Council . Had any other Clerks recourse to that Box ? Hayne . There were two of them , but I ca n't tell which . Council . So that after you had delivered it out you can not tell ? Had it any Date after you had delivered it out ? Hayne . No . Council . Have you ever heard that such Things have been done , that Warrants have been altered ? Hayne . I might before have heard , but not with my Certainty . Council . Did you know Mr Shuttleworth ? Did you never hear that he has done such a Thing ? Hayne . I heard such a Report , but I never heard all the Particulars . Q. to William Derisley . Is that your own Hand-writing upon that Warrant ? Derisley . My own Hand-writing . Q . Upon what Occasion did you write your Name upon the Back of that Warrant ? Derisley . In order to receive the Dividend ; now 't is a Warrant for 80 l. when I had it , it was for 8 l. only ; I received the Sum of Eight Pounds of the Clerk , and I left the Warrant with the Person that paid me . I ca n't remember the Clerk that I received it of . Council . You have been a Proprietor some Time ; Do you always sign your Name in the Book ? Derisley . Yes . Council . Did you at the Time you signed that Receipt , compare the Warrant with the Book ? Derisley . I read the Book I signed , and read the Warrant I signed , and the Warrant and the Book corresponded . Q . How much Stock had you at that Time ? Derisley . Four hundred Pounds , which is the only Sum I ever had in that Company . Court . You have been often there I suppose ? Did you always receive of the same Person ? Derisley . We generally go to the Person that is most at Leisure ; we do n't enquire for any particular Person . Council to George Woolley . You are concerned , I think , in the South-Sea House ? Woolley . I was Deputy-Cashier long before I was made Cashier . Council . Now you are Cashier ? Woolley . Yes , Sir . Council . Sir , Give my Lord and the Jury an Account whether you know the Prisoner at the Bar . Was he ever employed by the South-Sea Company as one of the Pay-Clerks ? Woolley . Yes , for twenty Years past . Council . Now , Sir , with Regard to keeping your Accounts with these Pay-Clerks . Woolley . Every Morning 't is my Business to issue out Bank-Notes and Money to the Clerks , to enable them to answer the Demands that might be made in the Office , by the coming in of the Dividend Warrants . When the Business of the Day is over , then we call upon them for the Notes , they have left ; then the y proceed to make up their Accounts ; and the Method is , they sort the Warrants , when that is done , they list these Warrants in the Pay-Book , to see what the Total amounts to , then they bring them to me , then I give them Credit , and allow them in the Account , the Sums wrote upon the Back of their Bundle of Warrants , signed by the Pay-Clerk , or with the initial Letters of their Names ; first they give the Name and Date , then the No . and Dividend , and then paid so many Warrants amounting to so much Money . Council . Is that the Method ? Woolley . Yes . Council . That being the usual Way , Do you ever give Credit without Warrants being thus described ? Woolley . No , Sir . Council . Now that Bundle you have in your Hand ; there seems to be upon that Bundle the Endorsement of the Prisoner at the Bar . Woolley . The whole of that Endorsement , the 11th of February , & c. except what is by the Examiner , is of Mr Pelling 's Writing . Council . Now inform my Lord and the Jury , whether you received this Bundle or that Bundle , with another Paper enclosed . Woolley . My Lord , we have an Office belonging to the Treasury called the Examiners-Office ; the Business of these Clerks is to check the Accounts that the Pay-Clerk makes of the Warrants ; upon the 11th of February , 1744 . I gave credit to the Prisoner at the Bar , to 155 Warrants of New Annuities 23 , the Sum of L . 2806 12 s. 6 d. My Lord , I have inspected the Journal where these Warrants are entered carefully , and among the Warrants entered on the Prisoner 's Account , that expresses the Sum of L . 2806 . 12 s. 6 d. Council . After you gave this Credit , I suppose you had this Bundle in your Custody ? Woolley . Yes , Sir . Council . But it laid in Order for the examining Clerk , to examine it for the Purposes you have mentioned ? Woolley . Yes , Sir . Council . In this Office of your 's , Do you know whether it continued or not continued till the Examiner took it ? Woolley . I have no Reason to think it was not there , there are several hundred Warrants . Q . Did you ever find any missing ? Woolley . No . Q . Do you make a Memorandum when the Clerk takes them away ? Woolley . No , my Lord . Council . How many Pay-Clerks were they ? What were their Names ? Woolley . Mr Gosling , Uther , Heister , and Mr Pelling . This Bundle was about ten Days before the Clerk had entered them . Council Is it usual to lay so long ? Woolley . No , Sir , they should not . Council . I am afraid it is but too common a thing for Clerks to exchange each others Places , and lend Warrants one to another . Woolley . No , Sir . Council . From the 11th of February , can you tell how long it might lie in your Office ? Woolley . I can not tell . Council . Then it might be near a Month ; nor you can not tell to what Examiner you delivered them to ? Woolley . After the Bundle has been past by the Examiners , they are kept in a Room under the Care of one Mr Gostling . Q . Can you take upon yourself to say , whether this Receipt was in the Bundle ? Woolley . I can not say . Council . I would ask you one Question , Who makes your fire for you ? Woolley . There is a Man on Purpose that comes every Morning in the Winter to make a Fire . Council . So that , during all that Time he is in your Office , he goes backward and forward , and he may let in whom he please ? Woolley . He should not . Council . I would ask , whether any body could not come backward and forward , whether you could have any Check upon him ? What Time is he there ? Woolley . About eight o'Clock , and I am there about nine myself . Q . Did you ever miss any thing out of your Office ? Woolley . No , I never missed any thing . Q . When was Mr Pelling first charged with this Fact ? Woolley . I think in October . Council . Was he not examined by a Committee of Directors ? Was he at Liberty all this Time ? Woolley . I can not tell . Q . How many Times was he examined ? Woolley . He was before the Committee , and examined for some other Fraud ; and as this Fraud was found out , they sent and took him up . Mr North . This might be nine or ten Days . Council . I suppose there is an Opportunity of going into your Office before the Papers are carried away , and another Clerk of the Office that actually gave in the Receipt , might take out the Receipt out of Mr Pelling 's Bundle . What was Mr Shuttleworth ? Q. to North . What became of the Prisoner after his former Examination ? North . To the best of my Remembrance he said he was ill , and went down to his House in the Country ; I think some Holiday intervened , and there was a Day appointed for him to come to the House : The Committee apprehended he was sled , he was sent for , and they brought him up to Town ; his Commitment was the 13th of November . Q. to Robert Hassel . Did you at any Time find any thing wrong with regard to that Warrant ? Hassel . On the 31st of October I made the Discovery of this Fraud . Q . What did you do with the Warrant when you found it out ? Hassel . I laid it by carefully , till it was laid before the Committee , and upon Tuesday the 4th of November , it was laid before them . Q . Was that the first Discovery of this Warrant of Derisley 's ? Hassel . Yes ; there was a Warrant also found out in the Name of one Hill , and then Alderman Baker issued out Warrants for apprehending three or four others ; Tew , Rouse , and Clark were taken into Custody , but the Prisoner was in the Country at that Time . Q . When was it Mr Alderman Baker issued out his Warrant for the Prisoner upon this particular Affair ? Hassel . As to the particular Time , I can not take upon me to say . Q . Were all three of them charged with Facts ? Hassel . No , Sir , it was only on Suspicion , nothing was proved . Q. to William Rouse . Have you been an Officer in the South-Sea Company ? Rouse . Yes . Q . How long ? Rouse . Four Years . Q . Are you now ? Rouse . I have been suspended for some Time , I was in the Examiners-Office , our Business was to enter the Warrants that are fetched out of the Treasury from Mr Woolley ; we enter them into Books that are kept for that Purpose . I was there from the Year 1742 to 1746 . Court . Will you look upon this Warrant ? Did that Warrant upon any Occasion come into your Hand ? Rouse . It came into my Hand in this Bundle . Council . How do you understand it was in this Bundle ? Rouse . Because I copied them in that Book . Q . Where did you receive it from ? Rouse . I received it from Mr Woolley ; looking to the Book , I found it was fetched from Mr Woolley by Mr Tew . When they are brought into our Office , they are put into a Glass Case ; these 155 Warrants are divided into two Parcels , I entered of the Bundle from A to K. Q . Who received this from Mr Woolley . Rouse . John Tow . Court . So you entered so much of the Bundle as from A to K ? Rouse . Yes . Q . At what Time ? Rouse . I can not say at what Time ; as soon as I was out of Business , I took this Book to do . Council . Are all Warrants from A to K in that Book ? Rouse . Yes , and the rest in the other Book . I have examined every one of these Warrants , and I found it there last Week . Council . Can you be certain , that particular Warrant of Mr Derisley 's was there ? Rouse . I found it in the Bundle , and entered it into the Book ; I cast up all from A to K , and Clark cast up his Part from L to Z ; so we cast up the whole to make up Mr Pelling 's Account . Q . How much does your Part amount to ? Rouse . From A to K , 69 Warrants they come to 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d. Council . Are all the rest of the Warrants truly entered ? Rouse . Yes , Sir , I have examined them myself with these Warrants . Q . Do you know upon what Day you made these Entries ? Rouse . I can not tell . Council . Can you recollect how long this Warrant lay in your Office ? Rouse . Sir , I can not tell . Council . How many People have Access to your Office ? Rouse . There were only four of us . Council . I suppose you admit other Clerks in occasionally ? Rouse . I have seen Mr Heister and Pelling in the Office upon different Accounts . Q . Have you any Memorandum what Day you received these Bundles ? Rouse . No , Sir . Council . Then , according to Accounts , I have heard Examiners have been guilty of these Frauds . Rouse . There have been those Things done . Council If the Clerk gives in a Number of Warrants to the Deputy-Cashier as Vouchers , and when the Number is short , Who comes to makes it up ? Is it that Clerk that gave it in to the Cashier ? Rouse . Yes . Council . Supposing that Mr Pelling had delivered in a Bundle that did not contain so many as is marked on the Back-side , Whose Business is it to bring in the Receipt to make it ? Rouse . Mr Pelling 's . Whosoever is the Person that finds out an Error , informs the Persons whose Warrants they are . Council . If this Bundle had been deficient , would you have told Mr Pelling , Sir . Rouse . Yes ; Mr Heister was ill in the Country , and he wanted a Warrant of 30 l. I asked Mr Pelling what I should do for it ; accordingly Mr Pelling gave me a Warrant of 30 l. which I entered in the Book ; after that , I acquainted Mr Heister with it , and he gave me a 30 l. Warrant in the Room thereof , which I gave to Mr Pelling . Q . Has the Prisoner desired you at any Time to do any thing to these Books ? Rouse . On the 14th Day of October , he and I were both attending upon the Committee , expecting to be called in , and finding the Committee was broke up , he speaks to me , says he , I want to drink a Glass of Wine with you ; we went to the Nags-head in Leaden hall street ; when I came there , he said , I have got a Thing to beg of you to do for me ; then , says he , you must keep it a Secret : Upon which I asked what it was , he told me there was an Entry in the New Annuities , No 22 , in Page 80 , or odd , to alter from an 80 , to an 8 ; I says , how can that be , when I am out of the Office to do any thing ; he said he could help me to the doing of it , I told him I would do nothing at all , and the Reason why that I lost my Place of 50 l. a Year , was by doing what little I had done for him ; he told me in Answer to that , in case that I did not do it , I must expect to hear of his Death . Q . What followed after this ? Rouse . We parted directly , he said he would have me to consider of it , and he would see me again at the next Committee-Meeting . I for some Time had received of him 12 l. 10 s. for my Quarter , I gave him a Note for it when I received my Money , that he should stop it ; upon our being taken up , he gave me my 12 l. 10 s. Receipt up , I got him to give me the Money before Quarter-day , and I gave him a Receipt for it , and he gave me up the Receipt afterwards without any Money . Council . Did he tell you why he gave up the Receipt ? Rouse . He gave up the Receipt as a Gift , as I had done him Services , I suppose that was the Design . When the Committee met afterwards , he came to me again , and said , Mr Rouse , as it will be of no Service to you to keep the 12 l. 10 s. Receipt , I desire you will give me another Receipt . Q . When was that ? Rouse . The Day after our meeting , I had anti-dated it to August , it was due at Michaelmas . Q . When was your Meeting ? Rouse . Our Meeting was the 28th of October ; when he found I would not do him that Service he wanted , the Thursday after the Court ended , he desired me to give it him back again , and said it would be paid in to the Company as so much Money . Council . What Time was it you gave the other Receipt ? Rouse . The Thursday following . Q . Who was by ? Rouse . No-body by , it was in the Office where we were attending the Committee . Council . But at the first Time you told him you could not do him the important Piece of Service he wanted , was he taken up the 14th of October ? Rouse . We were only then suspended . Council . After he had tempted you to do the thing you apprehended to be wrong , he still appeared at the South Sea House ? Rouse . Yes , Sir . Council . At the Time he gave up the Receipt , I ask you , when you refused serving him , whether he asked for the Receipt ? Rouse . He desired me to consider of it . Council . Are you discharged from the Company 's Service ? Rouse . I have never been there , nor the Gentlemen never sent to me but upon these Affairs . [ The Warrant that Mr Rouse referred to , that the Prisoner desired him to alter , was not the Warrant he was indicted for forging or uttering . ] Fleetwood Clark . This Bundle of Mr Pelling 's that I think was delivered into the Examiner 's Office , and Part of the Entry made from A to K , and the other Part from L to Z , there is Part of the Entry by my own Hand , and the other Part was entered by Mr Rouse . Q . What is the Amount of Mr Pelling 's Parcel ? Clark . The Amount of the whole is thus : 155 Warrants , 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d. Court to Mr Robert Hassel . I ask you again , Are you certain with respect to the Number of these Entries ? Hassel I have examined these Entries in the Journal , Warrant by Warrant , and the Sums from A to K , 69 Warrants , 1463 l. 10 s. 9 d. from L to Z , 86 Warrants , 1343 l. 1 s. 9 d. the Total , 155 Warrants , 2806 l. 12 s. 6 d. Q. to Fleetwood Clark . At what Time did you belong to the Examiners-Office ? Clark . About four Years , till I was suspended in December last . Council . How long may Warrants lie in your Office ? Clark . Two or three Days , sometimes more , sometimes less . Council . Have any other People any Recourse to your Office ? Clark . They sometimes do come in , the Warrants are locked up in a Glass Case . Council . Have any body Access to your Office ? Clark . Mr Heister has borrowed the Key upon some Occasions . Q . For what Purpose has he borrowed the Key ? Clark . It may be to charge a Warrant , or to that Purpose . Q . Did you ever see him do it ? Have you seen him make use of it , and take out a Warrant ? Clark . I never saw him . Council . I would ask you , Mr Clark , upon what you have said , if a Man had put a Warrant into his own Bundle , whether he might not , within the Compass of two Years , get it back again entirely ? Clark . Yes , Sir , and I believe he might have got it out during his Suspension , he was employed in examining the Warrants . Council for the Defendant . So he had Liberty from the Committee to examine his own Warrants after he was under Suspension . Council for the Crown . I want to know why it should be Matter of Wonder to you , when it should be in the Presence of other Clerks , the Man is charged with something of Fraud in his Office , why is it not natural for the Company to give him that Liberty to make up his Accounts ? Clark . Mr Pelling and Rouse both did look over the Warrants , there were People in the Office at the same time , and he has gone out with a Warrant into the Treasury to Mr Woolley . Council . Was Mr Pelling so closely watched , that he could not have taken a particular Receipt or the whole Bundle ? Clark . He might have taken away the Bundle , if there had been twenty in the Office . Council . Before this Suspension , these Receipts must have been in the Glass a Year or a Year and a Half . Clark . They are put afterwards into little Cupboards . Council . Has it been usual to have Keys to look into those ? Who is the Person entrusted with this Key ? Clark . Four Men , called the Examiners of that Office . Council . Suppose it be asked to lend that Key , has it been done ? Clark . I ca n't tell . Council to Woolley . Do you understand any particular Person at this Time did watch over the Prisoner ? Woolley . There was always some Body there . Council . That you can not say , as you was not always there - Mr Woolley , I wou 'd venture to ask , you are a Man of Candour , Do you think if a Person had a Mind to have got a Warrant away , he could not have done it ? Woolley . I believe he might . Q. to Pelling . Prisoner , What do you say in your Defence ? Pelling . I have not , my Lord , the least Remembrance , either of Mr Derisley , the Gentleman to whom the Warrant was payable , or of the Warrant itself . What Evidence therefore of Innocence can your Lordship expect from me of a Fact I am thus totally ignorant of : of the Forgery of a Warrant which is not so much as proved to have been , because it never was , in my Custody . - I have had the Honour , my Lord , to serve the Trustees of the forseited Estates of the late Directors , and the present South Sea Company , for upwards of 25 Years ; and in that Station I every Year paid many thousand Warrants ; but other Gentlemen , my Lord , served in the same Station : By what Hands this Warrant was paid , or by what Hands it was altered , is a Question I can not , and is in their Power only to say ; but this , my Lord , I can with Truth say , that if the Care of the Gentlemen entrusted with my Warrants had been equal to my Innocence , neither your Lordship , or the Gentlemen of the Jury , had been troubled with this Trial . Q. to William Rone . Do you remember when Mr Pelling was apprehended ? Was you the Constable ? Rone . I was not , the Constable was Humphrey Barnes . Q . Where was he apprehended ? Rone . At Comb . Q . Was that in his own House ? Rone . In my House , Sir , he appeared publickly ; the Constable , after he had executed the Warrant , he left him while he went to Barnes and dined ; he only said to me , Mr Rone , take care of Mr Pelling against I come ; and I did not take any Charge of him , I left him , and the Constable did not return till three in the Afternoon . Council . Then Mr Pelling might have went off ? Rone . Yes . Council for the Crown . Was there not one an Assistant to the Constable ? Had no Body an Eye to him ? Rone . There was none . Q . What Relation are you to the Prisoner ? Rone . I am his Son-in-law ; he came down some Time , because he thought the Air would do him good . Q . Have you seen the Constable lately ? Rone No . Court . Nor you do n't know where he is , nor why he is not here ? Rone . No , Sir . Council . How long had he been at your House before he was taken ? Did he abscond ? Rone . No . Council . Pray did you not give your Word to these People , that he should not go out of the House ? Are you not Petty-Constable ? Rone . Yes . He said he should expect to see him forth coming . Q. to John Thomson . Do you know the Prisoner at the Bar ? Thomson . I have known the Prisoner six and thirty Years , and have been intimate with him , and always found him to be a Man of great Probity and Honour . I have had a Grandson of his under my Care , and I think him a Man of good Oeconomy . Council . Did you ever concern him to be a Person that would be guilty of Forgery ? Do you think he would be guilty of utte ring any thing , knowing it to be forged ? Thomson . I do not . Q. to Michael Harvey , Esq ; How long have you known Mr Pelling ? Harvey . Six Years . Council . Do you think that he is capable of being guilty of Forgery ? Harvey . He has past Accounts of mine , and he has always behaved very well , and I have never found him wrong in any thing . Council . Do you believe that he would be guilty of Forgery ? Harvey . I never heard any thing like it of him , by his general Character in the Neighbourhood . I live at Comb , and he has past several Accounts for me ; and he has been a Tenant of mine . Council for the King . I dare say there 's no Person in the whole of your Acquaintance , that you think will be guilty of Forgery ? Rosomon Saunders . He has lived about five and twenty Years in our Neighbourhood , and bears a very just honest Character . I am left in Trust for some Part in the South-Sea , and he has always done very fair by me . - Belcher . I have known him 30 Years , I always took him to be a very honest Gentleman , and he always bore the Character of such a one . Q . Have you had any Dealings with him ? Belcher . The Gentleman had the greatest Part of a House of mine in Broad street , and the Reason of his leaving me was because the House smoaked ; he took the House of me four Years ago last Michaelmas . The Jury went out for near an Hour , then brought in their Verdict not guilty . After the Jury brought in their Verdict , that Mr Pelling was not guilty , the Court was moved for Leave to charge him with an Action of Debt , which the Court granted ; and he was charged in Custody of the Keeper of the Poultry Compter , by Consent of the Agent of the South-Sea Company , in an Action of 1900 l. 104. Jane Morgan was indicted for stealing 17 Pound of Brass , the Goods of Richard Midwinter . Richard Midwinter . The Prisoner was my Servant , I live in Shoe-lane , in the Parish of St Brides . Q . What Business are you ? Midwinter . I am a Founder ; a Boy came to me and asked me if I had lost some Brass , I told him I had lost my Maid , she had been out all Night ; I went down to the Gate-house , and she owned she had robbed me of the Brass , she offered it to Sale to Mr Walker ; I asked her how she came to do it , she told me the Devil was in her . Q . How long had she been your Servant ? Midwinter . Above three Quarters of a Year . - Walker . The Prisoner at the Bar came on Saturday Se'nnight , between six and seven o'Clock in the Evening , the Prisoner brought this Brass , she had it in her Apron , I had a Suspicion it was stole , I sent two Men with her to the Place where she said she lived ; she carried the Men about a good while , at last she said she had lost herself , but they brought her back again , and she was carried before Justice Burdus , there she confessed she had robbed her Master , she would not tell who her Master was , but there was a Person that knew her , that said she was Mr Midwinter 's Servant . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 105. Judith Taylor was indicted for stealing two Pewter Plates , one Holland Shirt , one Table cloth , one Napkin , & c. the Goods of Thomas Howel of Fetter lane , January 3 . Thomas Howel . I employed the Prisoner as a Washerwoman , and to scour my Pewter ; I live at the Red-hart in Fetter lane ; on Saturday was Fortnight she was at my House at scouring , I think it was the 3d of this Month , and in the Afternoon the Plate was sent out of Holbourn by a Pewterer to ask if it was my Plate : one of the Pewter Plates that she took was not mine , it was a new Plate that was sent to my House with some Brawn . Q . Did you lose any thing else ? Howel . That Day Week when she came to scour again , and I asked her how she could serve me so , to go to sell my Plate , she made me Answer , It was not wronging of me , it was not my Plate ; I said it was wronging of me , as it was in my Possession ; I said she should work no more for me , so I got a Warrant and took her up . Q . What have you lost ? Howel . I have lost a great many Things of Shifts and Shirts , and my Shelf stripped of all my Pewter ; I went up into Holbourn among her Acquaintance where she had worked , there I found she had sold a Shirt , Neckcloth , and Napkin , and a Couple of Plates , a diaper Napkin and Table cloth ; the Napkin and Table-cloth I found at Mr Gibbons in Little Turn stile , at a Pawnbroker 's . Q . Where did you find your Plates ? Howel . The Plates I found at Mr Singleton 's . Thomas Gibbons . I am a Pawnbroker , there was a Table-cloth and a Napkin Mr Howel had out which she brought , I lent her two Shillings upon them , she lived in the Neighbourhood , and has done many Years ; any thing she brought that was not likely to be her own , she said she came from other People . William Singleton . About the 12th of December , the Prisoner at the Bar brought two Plates to my House , and pawned them for 8 d. Mary Townsend . I have known the Prisoner a great while , she had used my House about seven Months ; about two Months ago she brought that Neckcloth to sell , she said it was her Husband 's Brother 's . Q .
