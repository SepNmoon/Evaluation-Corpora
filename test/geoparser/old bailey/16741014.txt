AT the Sessions holden for London and Middlesex , at Justice Hall in the Old-Bayly , which began upon Wednesday the fourteenth of October instant , were tryed several Malefactors , for divers kind of Felonies , as Thefts , Burglaries , Bigamy , Murther , Receiving of Felons , Foregery , and other Offences , some of the most remarkable of which , are these that follow . One was Indicted , together with a Youth , for stealing of a Horse , the Man was found Guilty , and received Sentence of Death , the Boy Acquitted . A Woman was indicted , as accessary with her Husband , for killing one with a Quart pot at St. Giles-Cripple-gate , it was prov 'd that her Husband did strike him , but no force being proved from her , she was by the Jury Acquitted . A Little Boy was Indicted for stealing a silver Beaker and spoon , it seemed by the Evidence that the Boy was imployed by his Master to do the Fact , who received the said plate , and melted it down , and then threatened to kill the Boy if he should discover it . The master was also Indicted for the same crime , and Convicted , but the boy was discharged . A Woman was also Indicted for Bigamy , for being marryed to one Husband upon the 6th . of March last , and to a second upon the 9th . of July last , her former husband being living , but no witnesses comming in against her she was acquitted by the Jury . A Gentlewoman came in upon bail , who was indicted , together with another for stealing a silver Tankard from a Woman in Bishops-gate-street , whither being newly come to Town she repaired to hire Lodgings , but not agreeing for them , the Woman of the house having about that time lost a silver Tankard , finds out by Inquiry where the Gentlewoman lived , and charged her with the taking of it , but upon the Tryal , it was thought to be a malicious prosecution , and the Gentlewoman was discharged . Two men were Arraigned upon six or seven several Indictments for stealing of Cattle , as Sheep , Hogs , & c. and pleaded Guilty to all their Indictments . One was Indicted for stealing of some parcells of linen , which the party that lost them being a Washerwoman , did swear were hers , and were found in the prisoners possession , and being ask 'd how she knew them , she replyed , by the marks , for that they were marked with N , but the prisoner very wisely to acquit himself affirmed that they were his Wives Linnen , and that the N was his wives mark , for her name was Nan : his little skill in Orthography declared that if he had come to his book he would have needed a prompter to have made a good Cleark of him : but he was saved from that trouble by his Jury , who brought him in not guilty . One was indicted for breaking open a House , and stealing several pieces of Gold and Plate , and being brought to the Bar , refused to plead , till he had his Gold restored to him , which accordingly was delivered , then he pleaded to his Indictment not guilty ; but the Evidence proving it against him he received sentence of Death . Several were arraigned this Sessions for receiving of Fellons and their goods , and harbouring of them in their houses , contrary to the statute in that case provided .
