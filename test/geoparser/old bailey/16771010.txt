With Permission . Ro . L'Estrange . LONDON : Printed for D. M. 1677 . The Proceedings at the Sessions for London and Middlesex . THe first Tryal was of a person upon an Indictment laid for Murder . One of Sheriffs Officers being to execute a Replevin for some Goods , takes the now Prisoner , who was both an Appraiser and a Constable , along with him to value the same , and if occasion should be to keep the Peace ; for which there happened to be cause enough , the man that had the Goods in possession making resistance and disturbance , and in the Fray his Wife pull 'd the Constable ; who thereupon , as the Witness swore , struck her with his hand on the side , of which she much complained , as they said , and about a month after died . The Prisoner alleadged , and had several to attest it , that he did not strike her , but onely gently laid his hand on her with fair words to put her away ; nor was there , when she died , any bruise or discolour on herskin to be seen ; that she had often been abroad very merry afterwards : And likewise he insisted that she was an infirm woman , and had , as she declared , never been well since her Miscarrying of a Childe about a year and half ago , & c. So that after a tedious sifting of the matter , the Jury , with much reason , acquitted him . A fellow next was found guilty to the value of Ten pence , for stealing Sugar out of a Warehouse neer Barking-Church by the Tower : he was discovered in the manner , sled over houses , and at last found laid flat on his belly on the Leads . The most considerable Tryal was of two Highway-men apprehended at Westminster upon suspition , and in one of their pockets a Watch and silver Tobacco-box , in the others three Rings ; of which notice being given in the Gazet , the Owners now came in and prosecuted . The occasion and manner of their being taken was thus : Lodging with others of the Gang , not yet taken , at an Inne at Westminster , some Gentlemen took notice of their often riding out and coming in at unseasonable hours , and inquiring who they were , 't was pretended they were bound for Ireland very speedily ; but suspitions dayly encreasing , the said Gentlemen finding them abroad one Saturday , resolved to watch them all night : About ten or eleven a clock the two that were now Prisoners at the Bar , came in , and going to bed , early in the morning they broke in upon them and secured them . There were here preferredtwo Indictments against both of them for several Felonies , which appeared to be Robberies in other Counties , and consequently excluded them from the benefit of the Clergie ; and a third against one of them for stealing three Rings . For proof against J. S . it was plain , a Watch and silver Tobacco-box being taken upon him , which were respectively owned by two Gentlemen , one robb 'd on Horse-back neer Blackheath by five persons ; the other robb 'd the day before in a Stage-Coach by a like number ; and both of them swore they verily believed J. S. to be one of the Thieves . Against the other the Evidence was not so direct : 'T was prov 'd they rod out together on the Saturday-morning , came home again at night together , and were taken on the Sunday morning in bed together ; that one of the Thieves was on a white horse , and he rid out on a Nag of that colour , & c. However he was brought in not guilty on both these Indictments , as likewise on the third for stealing of Rings . It seems he meets with a silly old woman one evening in drink , and perceiving she had good Rings , carries her first to a Confectioners and gave her Sweet-meats , then to a Tavern , where he laid her to sleep , and so went off with her three Rings : But he insisting that she gave him them , and she , by her own confession , appearing to have been insensible , the Jury did not think fit to finde the Felony against him . As for J. S. he was convicted on both the Indictments charged upon him . Nor could W. F . escape so : for there was soon after exhibited an Indictment against them both for a Robbery committed on the Highway Sep. 8. in the Parish of Southwine , neer a place called Potters Bar in the County of Middlesex : Upon which a Gentleman 's Servant gave evidence that his Master was robb 'd of a Watch , Riding-scarf , Sword , Belt , & c. and swore positively that the said F. was one of the Highway-men : whereupon he was found guilty ; but no certain proof appearing of his Companion 's being in this Action , he was brought in not guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] 'T is sadly known how common that mischievous crime of Counterfeiting , Clipping , and Filing of his Majesties Coin is become in most parts , to the great abuse of all good Subjects . For these offences there were no less than Three several persons tryed this Sessions : The first a young Lad , Apprentice in London , who by I know not what ill Tutors , had learn 'd a trade he was never bound to , viz . Clipping , which he practised on Sixpences ; and putting off several of them to a neighbouring Tradesman , he acquainted his Master ; who examining him , he confest the Fact , as in effect he likewise did at the Bar : and so was convicted of High Treason ; though 't is thought , in compassion to his Youth and Simplicity , he may have Mercie extended to him . The next was an old man , accused by his Landlord and his Daughter , who testified that there were Clippings found in a Purse of money which he delivered to one of them to keep ; asalso in an old pair of Shoos , produced in Court : That he often borrowed their Shears ( being a Taylors house ) on slight and false pretences , and sometimes desired to be private , & c. However , it not being very probable a person conscious of such a Crime , should deliver Clippings , which must infallibly cause suspition , discovery , and punishment , into the custody of persons almost wholly strangers , the Jury thought fit to discharge him . The third was a woman , lodging in S. Gileses . 'T is supposed her Husband was the person that did actually Clip , and that her business was to get Money in fit for the purpose . It being prov 'd that she often chang 'd Mill-money for other , but always desired that which was large , or otherwise would not take it ; which occasion 'd suspition , and her apprehension : which alarming her Husband , he fled , and can not be heard of . There were taken in her Lodging abundance of Files , Melting pots , and other Implements of that kinde , produced in Court . However , because under such Circumstances , our merciful Laws , in favour of Marriage , are pleas 'd to suppose the Wives act to be done by Coertion of the Husband , and that he by slight had acknowledged his own Guilt , she was brought in not guilty of the Treason . There were two other Indictments about a Gentlemans Servant that was killed in a Fray , which was found Special , and left to the determination of the Honorable Judges in point of Law . A Marshals man going to arrest a Gentleman , was so rude ( a thing too ordinary with many of those kind of people ) as to strike all that stood in his way ; and amongst the rest a Childe in a Gentlemans arms on the head : so that languishing of that blow about a month , it died , for which he was convicted of Manslaughter . Two poor Country-fellows having made shift to mount each of themselves on a stolen Horse in the furthest part of Essex , riding up to London on them , one of the Owners pursuing , got before them , and leaving notice at Bow , they were there stopt , and confest the matter before the Justice , as they likewise did now in Court very ingenuously : And so were found guilty . [ Death . See summary . ] A Fellow coming into an Alehouse in Westminster with a woman he call 'd Daughter , calling for Drink and Brandy , they made shift to get up stayrs , and take away Goods to the value of Twenty pounds . Then he pretends to fall asleep , whilst the woman goes away ; and being awakened , nothing was found about him ; so that on that Indictment he was clear 'd : but on another Indictment for a Silver-cup delivered into his custody to drink with , which was likewise lost , he was convicted ; and received a Brand in the hand . There were , in all , Seven persons burnt in the hand ; and for being too favourable to one of them , contrary to the positive Order of the Court , the Executioner was committed to the Bail-dock . Two women and one man were set aside for Transportation ; Three order 'd to be Whipt for Petty Larceny . And as for those that received Sentence of death , there were Five in number : viz . Two Highway-men , Two Horse-stealers , and One for a Burglary , who was Burnt in the hand the last Sessions but one .
