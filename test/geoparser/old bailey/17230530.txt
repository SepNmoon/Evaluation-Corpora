That Garraway , Sly , and himself , went together about 9 a Clock at Night to the Prosecutor 's House , and Garraway bid them go in and cheapen a pair of Gold Scales , telling them there was a Key that went into a Pin in such a Place of a Cellar-door , bidding them take an Opportunity to pull it out : That they did go in , but could not get an Opportunity to pull it out ; and coming out and telling him so , he swore they were a couple of Fools . That then Garraway went in himself , and supp 'd with his Cousins , and when he came out told them he had pull 'd the Key out of the Pin , and made all things ready to get in . That then he went in again , and said about half an Hour ; that then they went into Moorfields , and walk 'd about till after 11 a Clock , and came to the House again at almost 12 , but Sly espying a Light in the House , they walk 'd about till almost one a Clock ; and supposing all then to be fast asleep , Sly pull 'd out the Pin , took out the Bar and Garraway went in , and in half an Hour brought out the Plate , and gave the Tankard and Salver to Sly , and that the Plate being dispos 'd to each of them some , they would have gone out at Cripplegate , but did not dare to adventure , because of the Watch ; that then going to Moorgate , where there was but one Watchman , there Sly went through first , and in about half a quarter of an Hour Garraway and he this Evidence went through into Moorfields , and thence to Nan Gill 's where being let in , they set the Plate down on the Table , and Nan Gill poising it in her Hand , said it was but light , and so would not fetch a great deal , but as she judg 'd about 7 l. s but telling them she would sell it for them , and would not wrong them of a half Peny , that she did go to sell the Plate , but he saw her no more till she was secured . The Prisoners deny 'd the Fact , and call 'd some to their Reportation . Some depos 'd they knew Garraway , that he had kept a Turner 's Shop in Fenchurch-street , which he left off about New-Years-Day last . The Fact being thus plainly prov 'd , the Jury found them guilty of the Felony in stealing the Plate , but acquitted them of the Burglary . Transportation . John Harris , of the Parish of Alhallows Lombardstreet , was indicted for ravishing , and carnally knowing , Mary Hix , Spinster , the 29th of April last . Mary Hix depos 'd , That the Prisoner being Journeyman to her Master , Mr. Allen , Confectioner , in Gracechurchstreet , came thither the Night aforesaid , between nine and ten a-Clock , and went into the Kitchen , and there fell asleep : That between eleven and twelve the Family were for going to Bed , and another Journeyman said he should lie with him , but he refus 'd . That he still sat as tho ' asleep , till the Man and Boy were in Bed , and a young Woman also that lodg 'd in the House , was going up to Bed likewise ; but came down , upon her Desire , to bear her Company , she not being willing to be left alone with the Prisoner . That some Time after the Prisoner went up into the Garret , to go to Bed with the Apprentice , as she did suppose : Upon which they also went up to Bed , and when they came , the Keys of both their Chamber Doors were taken out , at which they were much surpris 'd ; and not having other Fastening , they were afraid to go to Bed , for Fear of some Design . And thinking the Keys had been taken away by the Prisoner , they went up into the Garret , to ask him for them , who after some Time told them , they were in one of their Rooms , and came down , pretending to shew them where the Keys were . That being all three enter 'd into the young Woman 's the Lodger 's Room , he pull 'd the Key out of his Pocket , lock 'd the Door , and put the Key in his Pocket again ; and siezing on her , threw her down on the Bed , and used her in a violent Manner . That then he threw up her Coats , and that she strove , and sav 'd herself as much as she could , for Half an Hour , 'till being quite spent , she could resist no longer ; and that he was so violent , that notwithstanding all she could do , and the young Woman , who was with her in the Room , who also assisted her as far as she could , he did overpower her , and she nor being able to call out very loud , and the Window-Shutters being nail 'd up , he did at length force her Body , put what he had into her , and - ( which though the Exactness of our Law makes necessary to be express 'd in Court , I depend upon it , the Modesty of Female Readers will excuse me , if I omit , and leave it to them to supply the Omission ) . That the next Day she was very bad , so that she could scarce turn herself in her Bed . This was confirm 'd by the young Woman who was there present ; who added , That the Prosecutor call 'd out to her for Help , she did endeavour what she could to prevent it , but could do her no Good , and would have broken open the Door , but could not . Mr. Allen depos 'd , That he being at that Time in the Country , when he came Home , perceiving his Maid , or House-keeper , in some Disorder , and crying , he ask 'd what was the Matter , and she gave him an Account how she had been abus 'd . The Prisoner deny 'd the Fact , and said that the next Morning she show 'd no such Resentment of any such Usage as she show 'd in the Prosecution , for that he drank Coffee with her the next Morning . The Prosecutor being ask 'd by the Court , said . That she drank Coffee the next Morning , with others of the Family , and that the Prisoner after they had been breakfasting some Time came up , but it was an Hour before she would permit him to have any . Another Evidence depos 'd , That after he had heard this Prosecution was carrying on , he went to the Prosecutor , and ask 'd her whether she meant to hang the Prisoner . That she reply 'd , No , she had rather marry him than hang him . Upon a full Hearing of the Matter the Jury Acquitted him .

That though they would not swear positively the Prisoners were the Men , they then having black Crape over their Faces , yet by their size and Voices they did verily believe they were .

John Turner , was indicted a second Time for a Misdemeanour , in cutting the Yard of Richard Dowdeswell , the 17th of April last . It appear 'd by the Evidence , That the Prosecutor Keeping a Coachyard , in which stood a great many Coaches , the Prisoner was taken in the Yard , at two a Clock in the Morning , and that when he was taken he pretended he shelter 'd himself there for Fear of being arrested ; but that appearing but a frivolous Excuse , considering the Time , he pretended at the Bar it was from an Apprehension of being taken up for a Deserter , he having been one .

Jane Holt depos 'd , That she was coming along with Mr. Ransum , the Deceased , from Westminster , being going into the Strand : That coming near the Admiralty Office , a Company of Soldiers were coming along , and that a Soldier came out of His Rank , and took her hold by the Mouth ; whereupon she said to him , You Fool , what is that for ? And heard Mr. Ransum , the Deceased , say , You Puppy , What do you meddle with the Girl for ? That she made Haste out of the Way , and stood at the Admiralty Corner ; and looking back to see for Mr. Ransum , The saw him lie on the Ground , weltering in his Blood . But she could not say which of the Soldiers , or who it was that wounded him . Mary Cottam depos 'd , That she living over against the Adminalty Office , saw out at her Window , the Soldiers coming by , and one of them went out of his Rank , and pull 'd a Girl , and the Deceased came next , and he push 'd the Prisoner , to push him off from the Girl , and there was a small Blow or two past between the Deceased and the Prisoner ; but who gave the first Blow she could not tell , but thinks they both struck , and that immediately she saw the Soldier take his Gun off his Shoulder , and gave it a Turn , and struck the Deceased , and she did believe with the Firelock End , and that the Deceased immediately fell : That afterwards the Soldiers all march 'd on , and pass 'd over the Deceased , and some of them gave him a flight Kick with the Foot . That then some Body set the Deceased up , and he was carried in a Chair to the Surgeon . But she could not swear that it was the Prisoner at the Bar that did knock the Deceased down . Nicholas Jones depos 'd , That it was the Prisoner that knock 'd down the Deceased . That he saw him go out of his Ranks about seven Paces to do it : That taking his Musket off his Shoulder , he gave it a Turn , and struck the Deceased with the Butt-End of it , and that he fell down , and the Rear Ranks marched over the Man . John Andrews depos 'd , That hearing his Neighbour Ransum 's Wound would prove mortal , he went to the Savoy , to get the Prisoner 's Name ; and there asking how he could be so barbarous as to strike the Man with the Butt End of his Musket . The Prisoner answered him , he did not strike him with the Butt-End , but with the Barrel . And Mr. Johnson depos 'd , That he talking with him as to the Provocation given him , the Prisoner said , the Deceased press 'd hard upon him in his Rank , and gave him a Wipe over his Cheek with his Fingers . Mr. Harris the Surgeon depos 'd , That he being with the Deceased about twelve a-Clock , he was speechless , and he found a large Wound on the right Side of his Head , three Inches long , and his Skull broken . That he made a Crucial Incision to discharge the Blood , while he got Instruments proper to trepan him , which he did about two Hours after and the Piece of the Skull he took out was broken , and he found about an Ounce and 2 Quarter of Blood , from the Blood Vessels of the Meninges of the Brain , which were broken , and that there was no Pulsation of the Brain . That the Man died about Nine a Clock that Night , and the Wound was the Cause of his Death . Several Neighbours spoke to the Deceased 's Character , that he was a very good humour 'd , peaceable , and quiet Man , and one whose Death was very much lamented by his Neighbours . This being the Substance of the Evidence for the King , the Prisoner said in this Defence , That the Deceased jostled him against the Wall , and said , What a Stir is here with King George 's Soldiers ? and that he never stir 'd out of his Rank , and did not strike the Deceased with the Butt End but the Barrel of his Musket : And he call 'd the following Evidences . Thomas Smith depos 'd , That as they were marching from the Prince 's Guard , the Soldier shoving against the Deceased , he gave him a back Wipe with his Hand , and the Soldier knock 'd him down , not with the Butt-End , but with the Barrel of his Gon , and the Deceased fell between his Feet ; and gave this Reason , that it was with the Muzzle End of his Piece , because the Ram-Rod was broken . John Dunning depos 'd much to the same Purpose . The like did also John Andrews ; and also High Stevenson depos 'd , That some Body jostled the Prisoner upon the Deceased , and the Deceased gave him a Back-Wipe , and that the Prisoner , knock 'd the Deceased down with the Muzzle End of his Musket . The Prisoner 's Colonel gave him a very good Character , for a peaceable , quiet temper 'd Fellow , having known him four Years , two Years of which he had been his Servant . The Jury upon a full Hearing of the Matter , found him Guilty of both Indictments . Death . John Smith , was indicted for a Misdemeanour , in taking four Guineas of John Mitchel , not to prosecute one Thomas Smith for a Felony he charg 'd him with , in stealing from him 2 s. 6 d . John Mitchel , and Thomas Tutchin depos 'd , That the former being Father-in-Law to Smith , who was a simple Lad , little better than an Idiot , who had been committed by Sir Francis Forbes , the Prisoner John Smith having charg 'd him with robbing him of 2 s. 6 d. he went to the Prisoner to get his Consent that he should be bail 'd out . That Thomas Tutchin went with him , That the Prisoner carried him to the Red Lion , near Cock-Hill , to the House of one John Spurrel , and said he would leave the Matter to him . That treating with Spurrel he insisted upon five Guineas , but after farther Discourse told them , That Smith would not do any Thing in the Matter under four Guineas . That he , John Mitchel , rather than the Boy should lie in Newgate , and he convicted of a Felony , and transported , did with much Difficulty get three Guineas , and would have given his Note for the fourth Guinea : But this not being accepted , his Friend lent him a Guinea , and then offer 'd the four Guineas to Mr. Smith , but Spurrel said he must not take them . Then they offer 'd it to Spurrel , but he refus 'd it , and told them , They should lay the Money down in a Room , which he did , and then going into the Kitchen , Spurrel call 'd Smith out , and he went into the Room , and took the Money , as he suppos 'd , for Smith said to them , Now I am ready ; if you will I 'll go along with you to get the Boy out . That they would have had him give a Note not to prosecute Thomas Smith ; but the Prisoner said there was no Occasion for it , he was now satisfied : And Spurrel said any Bail would do . It appear 'd plain to the Jury , by this and other Evidence , That the Prisoner did actually take the four Guineas to stifle the Prosecution of Thomas Smith . And two Women , Grace Thornton , and Elizabeth Williams , depos 'd , That the Prisoner meeting with them at an Alehouse , in some Discourse concerning this Affair , told them , it was like to go hard with him , unless he could get some Persons to swear for him . And told them he would give each of them a Yellow to do it . The Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him Guilty of the Misdemeanour , and the Court , in Consideration of his being represented a poor Man , sentenc 'd him only to pay a Fine of 25 l. and three Month Imprisonment .
