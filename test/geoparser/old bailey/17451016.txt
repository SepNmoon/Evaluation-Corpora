Council . Had not you your money again ? Cooke . Yes ; we had the money again next night . Council . The man only got drunk , and sat at the alehouse , and forgot himself . John Henwood . I went to the door with the cart , and the Prisoner stood against the door ; I asked him whether this was my Lord Cavendish 's ; he said , yes . He asked what parcels we had for my Lord ; I said three ; and he knocked at the door , and we carried the things in .

I told him I wanted him to go to my Lord Charles Cavendish 's to carry the guinea back again . He said he had not been out all night . He was in another suit of clothes , and said he had had no other coat on that night : then I went to Mrs. Cooke to ask her whether she could know the man again that run away with the guinea ; and when she saw him , she said that is the man who took the guinea out of my hand , and I know him to be the man : the Prisoner said , no , madam , I had none of the guinea . - This was about two hours after the thing was done ; the Prisoner had half a guinea in his hand , and I endeavoured to get it out , but could not , but his wife took it out of his hand , and gave it to us , and said that was more than we deserved ; then she gave us another shilling , and afterwards pulled out 3 s. 6 d. more , and said we should have no more , but at last she had it . Council . Was he drunk or sober then ? Henwood . He was as sober then as he is now . Council . Did not his wife readily pay the money ? Henwood . The money was paid to Mrs. Cooke , she had it again that night . John Barber . I have known the Prisoner seventeen or eighteen years , he is very subject to get drunk , and then he do n't know what he does , but when he is sober , I would trust him with 100 l. as soon as I would any man in England .

He was a second time charged by virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the wilful murder of the said Mary his wife . Mark Hawkins ( Surgeon . ) On Thursday the 3 d of October I was sent for about nine o'clock in the evening to go and see Mrs. Graham : a lad came with the Prisoner at the bar to me , and told me that one of their journeymen 's wives had fell down upon a knife and almost killed herself . I found a wound on the lower part of the belly , and part of the caul hung out . I asked her how she came by it ; she said her husband did it ; said I , he says you fell down upon a knife ; and she said again that her husband gave it her . I found very bad symptoms , and that she must die , so I enquired more particularly into the affair . I asked her whether they had had any difference ; she said they had no difference ; and she said she did not know how he came to do it ; but she said he was sometimes troubled with fits . And I satisfied the Coroner 's Jury that this wound was the occasion of her death . Q . Can you form any judgment , whether this wound was given by any body , or whether it came by accident ? Hawkins . She said it was given by her husband , but it is possible such a wound may happen by a person 's falling down upon a knife . Q . Was she sensible to the time of her death ? Hawkins . Very sensible , and therefore I was willing to get all the information I could from her , for I was of opinion she would die soon . Sarah Wilkins . I was very well acquainted with Mrs. Graham , she had a wound of which I believe she died . Q . How came she by that wound ? Wilkins . She said her husband stabbed her . Q . Did he and his wife live at variance ? Wilkins . No ; they always lived a happy couple till this thing happened ; and Graham never in his life offered to strike her but once . I saw her on the Friday about one o'clock after she was stabbed , and very bad . I asked her how it came ; she said her husband had stabbed her . He is subject to convulsion fits , and there are sometimes eight or nine men to hold him . Q . How came he by the knife ? Wilkins . I do n't know . Q . Had he any fit that day ? Wilkins . He had the next day , for he went to Dr. Mcdaniel to have some other advice , for his wife , and he fell down in a fit then . Q . Did she say he was in a fit , and stabbed her in a fit ? Wilkins . No ; she said he was just come out of it . Hannah North . The Prisoner is my own cousin ; he is very subject to fits ; his father died raving mad in Bethlehem . Jane Powel . I have known the Prisoner a great many years , and know him to be a very honest man till this unfortunate thing happened . I asked his wife , whether he was in his senses when he did it ; and she said , Jenny , no he was not ; for he was just come out of one of his fits , and then you know he is not sensible . Another witness said , she went to see her after the wound , and asked if her husband and she had had any words , and she said , No ; that he was just come out of a fit , and was not sensible ; and that this witness had seen ten men to carry him up when he was in a fit , that his wife and he lived very peaceably and quietly , and she never knew him to strike her : she saw him in a fit last Summer , and he almost bit his tongue in two , and was ill for a month . Richard Phillips . The Prisoner is a printer , I have known him twenty years , and have worked with him five or six years , and he lived very justly and very well with his wife : I was very intimate with them , and never heard the least complaint in the world ; he was troubled with convulsion fits , and would sometimes fall down by the press in them : I have seen him in one for an hour . Q . Have you seen him in a fit since his wife died ? Phillips . He was in one yesterday . Q . Perhaps they may be counterfeits ? Phillips . I do n't know as to that . Two other witnesses proved his being troubled with convulsion fits . The Jury acquitted him of the felony and murder , and also on the Coroner 's inquisition , and found that the deceased came to her death by accident . 377.

I came to find it out by an advertisement in one of the news-papers about some goods being stopped at the Haymarket , and found it was my cloth : and hearing the Prisoner was entered on board o'ship , I went to him , and he said , if I would be favourable to him , he would tell me where he had pawned them ; and I got leave of the regulating captains to take him with me . When he came on shore he told me , he had taken out of my warehouse two pieces of superfine cloth , one on the 12th of September was twelvemonths , and the other in March last . Prisoner .

They are both superfine , and I am sure they are my cloths . I had commission to sell them at 15 s. per yard . Mr. Marsh . I have three yards of cloth which was pledged to me by one Edward Williamson . I can not be certain the Prisoner is the man . Mrs. Goodman . Mr. Percivall came to my warehouse , and said , he had lost some cloth ; he found some that he said was his , and took it away : it came in the 29th of September . I can not pretend to know the man again that brought it . Mr. Butcher . This is a piece of cloth which was brought to our house the 26th of September last was twelvemonths in the name of Edward Williamson . I can not pretend to say the Prisoner brought it it is so long ago . [ Mr. Percivall proved his property in all these clothes . ] Prisoner .

And that the said James Wolfe did then and there feloniously utter and publish to the said William Threlkeld a certain false , forged , and counterfeit paper writing , with the name of James Talbot subscribed thereon , purporting to be a promissory note under the hand of the said James Talbot , as and for a true promissory note , which said paper writing is as follows : that is to say , Twenty days after the arrival of the Marquis De Antin and Luovis Erasmus privateers in the river Thames , I promise to pay Mr. Robert Masterson , chief mate of the Prince Frederick private ship of war , under my command , 100 l. sterling , in default of returning him one hundred and ten ounces of Spanish pieces of eight lodged by him in my hands . As witness my hand this 20th day of August 1745 . In Kinsale Harbour , James Talbot . with intention to defraud the said William Thelkeld . He the said James Wolfe at the time of his uttering and publishing the same well knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited , against the form of the statute , & c. The said James Wolfe was further charged in a second count of the said indictment , for feloniously uttering and publishing as true the aforesaid paper writing to the said William Threlkeld , with intention to defraud the aforesaid James Talbot against the form of the statute , & c. William Threlkeld . On the third of this month about seven o'clock in the evening I went out , and my servant brought me notice that a gentleman wanted to buy some goods of me ; when I came in the Prisoner said , Sir , Do you know me ? I said I did not remember him ; said he , I have been your customer before , and have sold you some dollars a while ago [ but I can not remember it ; ] and he said he had since that belonged to the Prince Frederick privateer , Capt . Talbot commander , that his name was Masterson , and he was chief mate of the Prince Frederick privateer . I asked him what goods he wanted ; he said he should want some watches , some buckles , some gold rings , gold buttons , & c. and desired to have the strongest I had in my shop . Accordingly while he was in the shop there was one pair of silver buckles looked out , four silver watches in double cases , and two pair of gold buttons . Q . Was there any thing more laid out ? Threlkeld . Not while he was in the shop , but the knee-buckles were to be looked out to the shoes , and some plain gold rings ; then this note was produced . I asked him what it was for ; he said it was for my security . I looked at the note , and thought it to be a pretty good one , I did not question it in the least . The note was signed by Capt . Talbot . [ The note was produced . ] This is the note the Prisoner at the bar gave me , and left with me as a security for the goods he was to have that night : then he said he was going to the Hermitage , and would be back again in an hour 's time . I thought after he was gone if this was a false note it would be a great loss ; and I went to a house in the neighbourhood where some gentlemen were , and shewed it to them : they advised me not to deliver the goods , but to bring the person there , and they would talk to him . He came some time afterwards , and some of the gentlemen talked to him , and asked him what post he was in ; he said he was first mate of the Prince Frederick privateer , that his name was Masterson , and Capt . Talbot was his commander ; but as fortune would have it , there happened to be four gentlemen there who knew him ; and the landlord said there were some gentlemen in the house who belonged to the ship , and should know him if he belonged to that ship ; and one Mr. McNamar , who came over as a passenger , said he was a villain , for he never was on board the ship ; then the Prisoner was for going out , and he did go out , and the landlord of the house brought him back again , and I charged an officer with him , and carried him to the Counter . Prisoner . When I went into the shop , I asked him whether he would accept of that note as a security for goods ; I mentioned no quantity or kind of goods . Mr. Threlkeld produced only one pair of buckles , and asked whether those were large enough . There is his apprentice , I desi re he may be sworn , to know whether there were any watches or rings produced , or any thing else . [ Capt . James Talbot appeared , but he being interested in the note , he was not admitted to give evidence . ] Edward Masterson . I know nothing of the Prisoner , or the note . Q . Look at that , is that Capt . Talbot 's hand-writing ? Masterson . That is not his writing , I have seen him write often . Q . Can you take upon you to say , that is not his hand-writing ? Masterson . I do take upon me to say it is not his hand-writing . Q . Is no part of the note his hand-writing ? Masterson . There is no part of the note like his hand-writing . Thomas Comyn . The Prosecutor came to me the morning after the Prisoner was taken up , and brought me the bill , and asked me whether that was Capt . Talbot 's hand-writing : I saw it was not his hand ; said I , it is not his writing , for his name is not spelt right . Q . Have you seen him write ? Comyn . Yes ; I saw him write about six months ago . Q . Look carefully at it , and see whether you are sure of what you say ? Comyn . I looked very carefully on it before , or I would not give my evidence so strong . [ The Court was informed that Mr. Ephraim Miller , one of the Grand Jury , was acquainted with Capt . Talbot 's hand-writing , and he was sworn . ] Q . Are you acquainted with the hand-writing of Capt . Talbot ? Miller . Yes ; I have seen him write , and have had letters from him . Q . How long is that ago ? Miller . It is some years ago ; I think it is about five years since I received a letter from him , and about seven years since I saw him write . Q . Is that his hand ? Miller . I believe not ; neither the body of the note , not the name ; the name is not spelt right . Q . How does he spell his name ? Miller . Talbot , and in the note it is with double ( ll ) and double ( tt ) . Q. to Masterson . How does Capt . Talbot spell his name ? Masterson . He spells it Talbot . Stephen Flower . I was in the house with the Prisoner at the bar the night he was apprehended , and asked him how he came by the note ; he said she had it of two men , and knew it to be a false note . Prisoner . How can that be , when I never had any conversation with you ? Robert Harding . I was with the Prisoner at the Counter the next morning , and asked him some questions : I asked him how he came by the note ; he said he had it from some people , but would not say from who , and that he would not trouble himself to prove who he had it from , for he knew it to be a bad note , and expected to receive no money at all but of Capt . Talbot . Prisoner . I believe I might say it was a bad note , but I did not know it to be bad . James Chariot ( apprentice to Mr . Threlkeld . ) I was in my master 's shop when the Prisoner brought this note , and offered it to my master as a security for the goods . Q . Did he ask for any goods in particular ? Chariot . No . Q . Did he ask for no sort of goods ? Chariot . He mentioned rings . Prisoner . Upon your oath I ask you , whether your master asked me about any sort of goods ? did not he ask me about watches ? how did I know he was a watchmaker ? I saw no goods but one pair of silver buckles . Chariot . There were some watches shewed to you . Q . What did the Prisoner say when he came into the shop ? Chariot . The shop was shut , and my master was not at home . I asked him what he would please to have ; he said he wanted my master ; I said , will nobody do but my master ? he said , no ; and that he had sold some dollars to my master some time before , and wanted to see him ; then I fetched my master ; when he came , the Prisoner and he had formerly told him some dollars , and that he came home chief mate of the Prince Frederick privateer : my master said he was glad of it ; and then he said his name was Masterson . Q . Did I say my name was Masterson ? Chariot . Yes ; you did . Prisoner . Did your master deliver me any kind of goods ? Chariot . Yes ; buckles . Q . Did he deliver them ? Chariot . He shewed them to you . Q . How many ? Chariot . One pair . Q . Did he shew you any watches ? Chariot . Yes ; he did . Prisoner . Then upon my oath you tell a d - d lie , I never saw any watches , he delivered me none , and shewed me none , he only shewed me one pair of buckles ; and when I gave him the note , he said , how shall I know whether it is a good note ? and I bid him enquire about it , and satisfy himself . Pray , Mr. Masterson , is your name Robert Masterson ? Masterson . My name is Edward Masterson . Prisoner . The note says Robert Masterson , so this can not be this man 's money . [ The note was read , and is as in the indictment ] Prisoner . It is mentioned in the note first mate , or chief mate . Pray , Mr. Masterson , are you first mate of the Prince Frederick ? Masterson . I am first lieutenant . Prisoner . Then there are two deficiencies between the note and the indictment . The Jury found him guilty of uttering and publishing the note knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited . Guilty , Death . 380 . Matth.ew Robinson , of St. Gregory by St. Paul 's , was indicted for stealing a silver shoe-buckle , value 3 s. the property of Marmaduke Johnson , Sept. 21 . And 381. John Penn for receiving the same knowing it to be stolen . Marmaduke Johnson . Robinson 's father cleans my shoes ; the boy came for the shoes , and one of the buckles being left in the strap , he took it away . I went and acquainted his father with it , and he searched for his son , but no son could be found . I said to some of the porters , if you see Robinson 's boy bring him to me , and in about a quarter of an hour he was brought to 5 s. I threatened to sent him to Bridewell , and he fell down his knees , asked pardon , and said he had sold it to a man in the New Market . Penn sells old buckles , & c. I said to Penn , friend , did you buy a buckle of a boy to day ? he said , yes , and clapped his finger upon one which was not worth a half-penny : I pulled out the fellow buckle to that which was lost , and said this is the fellow of what you bought of the boy , and he owned he had sold it for 3 s. and he gave the boy but a penny for it : I believe the child did not know it to be silver . Job Lilly . Penn brought this buckle to me to sell : it weighs twelve penny wt . it is not standard marked silver . I knew Penn , for he had lived with a silver buckle maker : he said it might be as good silver though it was not standard marked , as if it had , and so it may , but it is not very probable . Charles Rave . The boy owned he took the buckle out of the shoe , and sold it to Penn , and Penn owned he bought it for a penny , and sold it to Mr. Lilly for 3 s. Several witnesses appeared for Penn , one of whom had known him thirty years , and never knew any ill of him ; and Mr. Lilly said he knew a great many of the trade , and never heard any body give him an ill word . Both acquitted . 382 . + John Jack * , of the Precinct of St. Catharine 's , was indicted for stealing six guineas , the property of Elizabeth Stutwell and George Dent , in the dwelling-house of Elizabeth Stutwell and George Dent , Oct. 11 . * He was tried in the mayoralty of Sir Robert Willimott , Knt . by the name of Abraham Benjamin , for stealing four moidores out of a money shovel in the shop of Henry Sheere , a goldsmith in Lambard Street , and aquitted . See April Sessions Paper in that mayoralty , Numb . IV . Part II . page 159 . N. B . The Prisoner being a Turky Jew , and pretending not to understand English , an interpreter was sworn . Elizabeth Stutwell . The Prisoner came to my house and Mr. Dent 's ( my partner ) at cole wharf in St. Catharine 's between eleven and twelve in the forenoon , and said he wanted six sacks of coals , but did not ask the price . He pulled out a handkerchief , in which there seemed to be a pretty deal of money , pulled out a 36 s. piece , and wanted change , and said he must have the change in half guineas . I had a bag of money , and in order to give him change I went up stairs , and he came up stairs after me . I poured the money into my lap , and the Prisoner put his hand into my lap , and took out a handful of guineas . I seized his hand , and made him drop them , and several fell upon the ground : said I , you villain , do you come to rob me at noon day ? I desired my servant to stop him till I could tell the money , and I missed one guinea ; and he offered me the guinea again . He was taken on Butler 's wharf , and I carried him before Justice Dennett , and he offered the guinea then . Jury . How did you understand him ? Stutwell . He spoke broken English : I am certain he did not want change , because he had 3 l. 10 s. in silver , thirteen guineas , and other money : when he came to me he spoke pretty good English , but when he came to Justice Dennett 's he could not understand any English at all . Hyam Aaron sworn . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Aaron . My Lord , I have something else to say before I come to that . I happened accidentally to come this way . I keep a grocer 's shop in Shoe-maker Row , and I believe deal in 900 or 1000 l. a year : I deal in oil , sand , and coals . I went to a wharf to get a load of sand , there was a little side box , and who should sit there but this gentlewoman [ Mrs . Stutwell . ] I asked her what the sand was a load ; she said seven shillings ; I said I gave no more than six shillings for white , and six shillings and six pence for red : she got up , and said , get down you Jew son of a bitch , and offered to knock me down , so I went to the next wharf . Ask her , if she did not serve me so ; and if you will enquire into my character , there are enough here that know me . Now I come to the matter . I have known the Prisoner about four years , and have dealt with him for more or less ; and I believe I have as good a shop as most people . He first bought necessaries for himself of me , and when he set up a little shop for himself , he bought goods of me . Zipporah Silver . I have known him between four and five years , he lived in our neighbourhood , and behaved very honestly : I have sold him several parcels of goods to go to Jamaica . I am a hoop petticoat maker . Give me leave to speak something in the Prisoner 's behalf : when the gentlewoman took the Prisoner up , she charged him with no more than a guinea , and now she charges him with six guineas . Solomon Aaron . I sell Birmingham ware ; the Prisoner has dealt with me three years , and has paid me as honestly as the day is long . I never knew any thing but justice and honesty by him Guilty to the value of twenty shillings . [ Branding . See summary . ] 383 . + Grace Usop , otherwise Tarras , of St Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for the murder of her female bastard child , by throwing the said child into a privy belonging to James Leger , wherein there was a great quantity of filth and excrement , by reason of which throwing , and by reason of the said filth and excrement , the said child was choaked and suffocated , of which choaking and suffocating the said female bastard child died , September 1 . And 384 , 385 . + James Leger , and Magdalen , otherwise Maudin Leger , his wife , were indicted for aiding , abetting , and maintaining the said Grace Usop to commit the said murder : and therefore they the said Grace Usop , James Leger , and Magdalen , otherwise Maudlin Leger , the said female bastard child , feloniously , wilfully , and of their malice aforethought , did kill and murder , & c. Eleanor Johnson . A few days before this thing was discovered , I went into Mr. Leger 's house for half a pound of butter , and the Prisoner was there , and she was very bad . I asked her if no body was there but herself ; she said her mistress was in the garden ; presently her mistress came out of the garden in a very great flurry , and Mr. Leger himself came in in a very great flurry , and he said , Tarras , my girl , you are very bad , will you go to bed ? and he said she should go to bed , and he called Maudlin to make the bed ; said he , will you have the bed warmed ? she said I do n't care if I have : he said , Maudlin , my poor girl , is a very faithful servant , and she is very bad with them , and has strained herself with carrying coals , she wants the bed warmed . He asked what he should give her ; and I said half a pint of ale with sugar and spice : and one Mrs. Lewis came in and said , Mrs. Johnson , have you heard of the murder ? I said I had not ; she said there was a fine boy in the vault : she put her hand down into the vault three times , and brought up nothing but soil , and the fourth time she put her hand down , she said , here 's the child , and I could not think but it must be a girl , but there were some circumstances that made me think it was a boy , for the navel string hung between the boy 's legs , and she thought it was a boy by that . Q . Is she married ? Johnson . I do n't know that she is . Q . Do you know that this girl had a child ? Johnson . I heard so . Q . Then you do n't know that she had a child ? Johnson . I never had any thought of it . Q . Then there was a child in the house of office , and the child was dead ? Johnson . Yes ; the child was dead when I saw it . Mary Lewis . I have known Grace about two years . Q . Is she married ? Lewis . Not that ever I heard of . Q . Do you know any thing of her having a child ? Lewis . I do n't know any thing of her having any . Coroner . Did she say any thing to you about the child ? Lewis . On Thursday the first of September she went out for some rolls , I met her at Mrs. Johnson 's house , and she said she was very ill with a pain in her bones . I went to Mr. Leger 's house , and Mrs. Leger said that Tarras was very bad , so bad that she was forced to go up with a mop and a pail to clean the room : then I said to Mrs. Leger , with your leave shall I go up and see her ? and she said , yes : I went up , and Tarras lay upon the bed with her clothes on : the room was wet , and I asked her who had been up to wash the room ; she said her mistress had been up with a mop and pail , and cleaned it : she was very much out of order : I sat down by her , and asked her what was the matter with her : said I , have not you miscarried ? said she , what makes you think so ? I was backward and forward all that day , and Mrs. Leger said , how does Tarras do ? I said she was very bad indeed , and that she would not be well of the months . On the ninth of this month one Bellache came and asked after Tarras ; said I , what makes you ask after her ? he said , if you want to know , go to the vault and satisfy yourself . I asked Mrs. Leger to let me go to her vault , and I went to the vault , and looked down , and saw something , which I took to be a child . I went to Tarras , and said , Tarras , this is your child ; said she , Lord Jesus ! Lord Jesus ! Molly do n't say so . I came into the house , and said to Mr. Leger , there is a child in the vault ; what in yours , said he ? no , in yours , said I ; and he went in , and there was no more said about it . I went to Mrs. Johnson 's , and said there was a child in the vault , and we both went together . Coroner . Had you any talk with her afterwards whether she had a child ? Lewis . She said she went to the vault , for she thought she had occasion to go there ; and afterwards went into the shed , and said , sick , sick , sick ; that she went up stairs , and leaned upon the window , and then she was delivered of the child ; this was on the second of September . Q . When was it that the child was found ? Lewis . On the ninth of September . Q . What day was it that Grace said she was delivered as she was leaning upon the window ? Lewis . That was the day it was found out . Q . What day was she delivered ? Lewis . She said it was on Sunday the first of September . Leger 's Council . Did she say whether the child was dead , or alive , when she was delivered ? Lewis . She did not say whether it was dead , or alive . Usop 's Council . Was there any thing found under the bed in a box ? Lewis . Yes ; there was a box of child-bed linen , and Usop said she bought it in Rag Fair against she was brought to bed , unknown to any body . Dorcas Randolph . On Monday the second of September , which was Usop 's birth-day , I was abroad with her , and she was very bad ; and they said the child was born on the first of September , and was found in the vault on the ninth . I said to her , you have had a child , for there is a child found in the vault . I asked her if she had made any preparation for it ; she said she had , and that the box was under the bed ; said she , Mrs. Randolph , you are best able to stoop , put your hand under the bed , and pull it out , and I did . She said Mr. Leger had threatened her , and bid her lay it upon James , or the Baker ; and then she said , must I tell a lie ? and he said , ouy . Q . When was this ? Randolph . On the ninth of September Mrs. Leger did own before the Justice , that the child had a bruise on the head : I said , how came the child to have a bruise on the head ? she said that was nothing at all , for it was not done out of malice ; and she emptied the pot with the after birth , and she pleaded ignorance , because she never had had a child ; for people who have been in labour know more than those who have not . Council . When this discourse was with Tarras , was there any talk whether the child was born dead or alive ? Randolph . She said she was very bad , and her master came up and helped her in the birth , and parted one from the other , and took it in an apron , and carried it down stairs . Q . Was the child dead or alive ? Randolph . I can not say any thing to that . Joachim Bellache . One of my shop-mates discovered the child in the vault on Friday in the afternoon , and said , Mrs. Bellache , there is something in the vault that looks like a bundle of Rags . I went down in the night to ease myself ; I had a suspicion of something , so I was very curious , and put my finger into the vault , and thought it was flesh . I put my finger upon the body , and felt the ribs , and then I was afraid of what really was , and found that it was a child , but , I did not care to speak to Mr. Leger about it then : and Mary Lewis came in and said , there is a child in the vault : said I , Mr. Leger , it does not signify any thing talking , I told you before that your maid was with child , and he said she had had the ague and fever , and had taken too much bark , and it had hindered the courses ; then I told him there was a child in the vault ; he seemed surprized at it , and said , if it was so , he would send for an officer , and he ordered one Paul Ellis to fetch the beadle . Ann Baker , midwife . I saw a child that was taken out of the vault . Q . Was it born dead or alive ? Baker . I could not judge whether it was born dead or alive . Coroner . Did the child come at the full time ? Baker . It did not come at its full time , I am almost sure of it . Council . You say you could not judge whether the child was born alive , how could you know whether it was at its full time ? Baker . Oh , Sir , that I am very sure of . Henry Gundy , Surgeon . I was sent for about the 13th of last month , and found a child which was very much putrified . I did not care to open the child , but found upon examining the child , that there was a violent pressure upon the skull , which if that had been given when the child was alive , must have been the occasion of its death . Coroner . Was the child full grown ? Grundy . In my opinion it was . Leger 's Council . As to the pressure upon the head of the child , was that given before the child was dead . or after ? Grund . I can not pretend to say whether the wound was given before or after . Leger 's Council argued , that he could not think there was any evidence to affect Mr. Leger and his wife , and could hardly think there was any to affect the principal . That he was informed Mr. Leger has a wife of his own , and therefore very unlikely he should be guilty of the fact . And that in order to make it a murder , it must be first proved that the child was born alive . [ Vide Statute 21 . James I . ] Eleanor Johnson called again at the desire of the Coroner . Q . What happened after you found the child in the vault ? Johnson . When I found the child in the vault , I went into the kitchen , and fell into , and said to Mrs. Leger , this is a terrible case ; and she said Tarras was very bad , and that women in her care are never well of the months . I came out to Mr. Bellache , and he clapped his hand upon my belly , and said , God bless your belly , and said , I hope you will not drop it as somebody has done . Another thing I remember , I saw the child on the 10th of September , and it bled out of one of the ears , I think it was the left ear . On the Tuesday Tarras 's mother and another woman were there , and they sent for me , and Mr. Leger said , Mrs. Johnson , you must go up and tell Tarras 's mother to bribe the midwife , or else Tarras will be hanged . Coroner . She has not answered the question yet . I ask you what Tarras said when you went up to her ? Johnson . I told her there was a fine child found in the vault , and they said it is yours : and after I had got an acknowledgment from her , that she had been with child , I said , who is the father of the child ? and she said my master ; and she asked where her master was , and she said , call my master up . I went down to him , and he went up to her , and she wept bitterly : they talked together in French , and I could not understand them ; and when he was gone , I asked her what her master said ; and she said , he says I must lay it to James , or the Baker , or else I shall be hanged . Capt . James Dalbiac . I have known Mr. Leger forty years . I never heard any thing against his character in my life ; he is a man of reputation , and a sober diligent man in his business . Mr. Simon Dalbiac . I have known him forty years , and I never heard any thing against him , he always bore the character of an honest man . Mr. Ross . I have known him twenty years , he is a sober honest man , and a good natured man , and she is a sober industrious woman . Thomas Newland . Mr. Leger and his wife are both people of very good characters . Mr. Perim gave him the character of a very honest man . These gentlemen being asked , whether they thought he would be guilty of aiding and assisting in the murder of the child ; they said they believed he would not . They were all acquitted of the murder , and likewise of the charge on the Coroner 's Inquisition ; and the Jury found that the child was still born . 386 . + Martha Orton , otherwise Bristow , of St. Mary Whitechapel , was indicted for assaulting Ford Boley on the King 's highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a steel tobacco box , value 1 s. and six shillings in money , his property . July 15 . Ford Boley * . On Monday the 15th day of July last I went to Ratcliff Cross to one Mr. Walter 's a jeweller , and on my return home between eleven and twelve at night , where I had been with a goldsmith that I deal with , and going by Moses and Aaron Alley in Whitechapel , I was assaulted by five women ; they asked me for a dram , which I refused to give them ; upon that they said I had money , damned me , and said I should give them a dram , and they gave me a cut cross the nose with a knife , or some edged tool . I can not tell what . I have got the mark on my nose now , and then they robbed me of a tobacco box and six shillings ; after that they stopped my mouth , and dragged me into a house in Moses and Aaron Alley into a room up one pair of stairs , and robbed me of some jewelling work , which was in my pocket , to the value of between nine and ten pounds . * Judith Tilley was tried in last September Sessions for the same robbery , was guilty , and received sentence of death . There were three other women in custody last sessions for the same robbery , but Mr. Boley could not be quite postive they were the persons who robbed him , and so would not prosecute them , and they were discharged at that goal delivery . Q . How long was this robbery committing ? Boley . It was not above a quarter of an hour , ( they had gagged me before in the street ; and the house they carried me into was kept by one Susan Gray , whose husband was impressed , and is gone to Nova Scotia . He was a notorious gambler , who kept a house in Black Boy Alley , and harboured several of those street robbers who were convicted last December sessions ) after I was robbed they put the candle out , and turned me out of doors : upon that I went down to the watch-house in Whitechapel , and got the watch to come with me , but could not get the door open . Q . How came you when you had been robbed not to get the door broke open ? Boley . I can not tell ; the woman of the house , Susanna Gray , was one of the Black Boy Alley gang . The next morning I got a warrant from Sir Samuel Gower in order to search the house ; and by the information of the neighbours I got an account of the names of several that frequented that house . I did not know the name of the Prisoner till she was taken up . I was sent for by the people who took her . William Hind and one Remmington . I took up three women last sessions who I could not swear to , that was one Betty Cooper and two others ; and it was upon Betty Cooper 's information that the Prisoner was taken up . Q . How came you not to get Betty Cooper to come and give evidence ? Boley . She is one of the same sort of people , and I can not tell where to find her . The Prisoner said before the Justice , that she got her living only by whoring and thieving . When we came to search the house the next day , the Prisoner had hid herself under the stairs in the same house , where I was robbed , and she was aiding and assisting at the time that I was robbed . Q . How came you to take such particular notice as to remember the persons who robbed you ? Boley . There was the light of a lamp , and by that I had a particular opportunity of taking notice of faces , and I was very sober . Q . Did you cry out ? Boley . I cried out once , but they stopped me from crying out any more . Q . Now give an account what each of them did ? Boley . Judith Tilley , who is convicted , robbed me of my tobacco box and money , the others , who were concerned with her , held me in the street , and swore they would murder me if I offered to resist , stopped my mouth with a handkerchief , and afterwards dragged me down into the alley , and robbed me of my jewelling work : Q . Do you know the Prisoner to be one ? Boley . I do know her to be one . Q . What did she do ? Boley . She held me by the arm , and swore that she would murder me if I resisted . Q . Was you down upon the ground then ? Boley . Yes ; and I had nothing to defend myself with , not so much as a stick in my hand . John Boddington , a jeweller in Alderigate Street , said he had known the Prosecutor twenty years , and knew him to be a very honest man . Q . Why did not you bring the watchmen here ? Boley . I did not think I had any occasion for them , as I did not bring them the last sessions . Acquitted . 387. William Beeson , of Chiswick , was indicted for stealing a silver watch , value 1 l. two shirts , value 5 s. two stock , value 1 s. three pair of stockings , value 1 s. and one pair of shoe , value 2 s. the goods of James Whitlaw , Sept. 18 . James Whitlaw . I am servant to Counsellor Fazakerly . On Wednesday the 19th of September , I lost the key of the stable-door on Turnham Green ; and that night , between 10 and 11 o'clock , the stable was robbed , and I lost a watch , and several other things , out of my room . - I am postilion , and second coachman . William Dean , ( coachman to Mr . Fazakerly . ) Upon the Wednesday between 7 and 8 at night , I locked the stable door , and went out ; and that evening I saw the Prisoner playing at cards at the Crown , where I went to drink a pint of beer : he swore he was very drunk , and must go to London ; and he went out between 9 and 10 , and Whitlaw would have had him have lain with him : and when I went home , I found the stable door unlocked , and left open . Edward Hill said he saw him on Turnham Green the 18th of September at six at night , and he said he was in liquor , and must go to London . They were informed that he lay at the Angel at Hammersmith that night . Thomas Horlock . I keep the Angel at Hammersmith . I believe the Prisoner is the man , but I ca n't swear to him . He came to my house about eleven o'clock at night a month ago , and asked for a lodging : he pulled out a watch , and said , take care of this watch , it is an unfortunate watch , for I have broke two or three glasses . Q . Do you know the watch the Prisoner left with you ? Horlock . How should I know the watch ? I do n't know the watch ; this watch has got a glass in it , that had none . William Coare ( Constable . ) Mrs. Gibbon at the Red Lion in Gray's-inn-lane sent for me , and said she believed the Prisoner was the person that robbed Mr. Fazakerly 's servant . I said , Young man , you had better make an ingenuous confession , and it will be the better for you . And then the Prisoner pulled out a watch , and said , this is the watch I took from Whitlaw . I asked him how he could serve a man so , who had been to kind to him . He said , he believed the devil was in him , or the devil possessed him ; and he gave me a pair of stockings off his legs , and a short off his back , and owned the taking the shoes , but that he got drunk and lost them : he said he found the key of the stable , and took the things out of the Prosecutor 's room . Mrs. Gibbon said , the Prisoner had lived twice with them , and always behaved very handsomly : that she had heard of the robbery , and so took the Prisoner up , and he owned he took the things out of the stable . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 388. Mary Allen , of St. Clement Danes , was indicted for stealing a silver medal , value 2 s. 6 d. the goods of Frances Wilson , October 8 .
