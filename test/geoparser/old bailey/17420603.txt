Enoch Stepple . The 7th of May , at eleven o'Clock at Night , I went to Bed and left my Son ( who is my Partner ) up , and about five in the Morning , he came up and told me , that the House was broke open , and we were robb 'd ; that the Drawer in the Bar was broke to Pieces , that the House was broken into up-one Pair of Stairs , that a Pane of Glass was taken out , and the Casement left open , and that the House-door was unlock 'd and left open . My Lord , I miss 'd the two Linnen Bags , one of Silver , and the other of Gold , in which there was upwards of 190 Pounds in Gold and Silver . My Lord , I did not suspect the Prisoner , who lived next Door to me , and was an Apprentice to a Barber and Perriwig-maker ; but , my Lord , last Sunday was Sen'night , I was in the Country as Hackney , and the Prisoner 's Master came and told me , that he had taken the Person that had robb 'd me , and had got the greatest Part of my Money . I came Home on Monday , and went to the Sun-Tavern , in Milk-Street , where the Prisoner was brought from the Compter , by the Constable . I ask 'd the Prisoner which way he robb 'd me . He said , that he clamber 'd up the Out-side of the Bar , in the Court , and got up into the Coving of the first Floor , and that he drew up a large Sash Window , that open 'd into the first Floor , and the Shutter being fast pin 'd , he could not get in there ; that then he went to the Casement that was on the Stair-case , and took out a Pane of Glass ( a square Piece of Glass ) and put his Hand in , and opened the Casement in the Inside . I ask 'd him , whether he took the Pane of Glass out with a Knife , and he said no , he did it with his Nail : he said , that then he went into the first Floor , and came down Stairs , and open 'd the Bar-door , and went into the Bar , and broke open the Drawer with a Chissel . I ask 'd him , how he came by the Chissel , he said , he bought it for that purpose . I then ask 'd him , where it was , and he said , that he had thrown it away : He then own 'd that he took both Baggs of Money away , a Bag of Gold and a Bag of Silver . I ask 'd him , what he did with them , he said , that he went into his Master 's House , that the Door he had left upon a jar , and went up Stairs , and hid the Bag of Gold between two Stacks of Chimneys at the Top of his Master 's Leads , and then went down upon the Leads of the Church , and hid the Bag of Silver in a Hole under the Roof ; then I took the Bank Note that he had of 100 l and asked him , whether the Money that fetch 'd that Bank Note was mine , and he said it was . My Lord , there was 18 l. that he had lodg 'd in a young Man 's Hands , at the other End of the Town , and he said , that that was also my Property , and the young Man 's Master delivered the Money up to us . This be own 'd before Sir George Championand discharg 'd the Person that he preseaded to be his Accomplice . Prisoner . When you got up in the Morning , did not you ask my Master it I was at home ? E. Stepple . I did not . Prisoner . Did you not find that I was at home at five o'Clock in the Morning , when you found your House was broke open ? E. Stepple . I was a-bed at five . John Stepple . About half an Hour after eleven at Night , the 11th of May last , my Father seemed very sleepy , and I asked him , whether he would not go up to Bed , and he went up to Bed , my Mother was gone up before . About twelve o'Clock at Night , I told my Money , and put it into these two Bags , and lock 'd the Drawer , and put the Key into my Pocket , the Company being all gone , I went all round the House , and put my Hand against this Casement that was broke open , and it was safe . The next Morning I call 'd the Men up at five o'Clock , as I always do , and they went down Stairs , and in about five Minutes time , the Men came and told me , that the Door was broke open , and the Till was broke , and I came down and found it so , and I miss 'd the 2 Baggs , one of Gold , and the other of Silver , there was in them , 195 Pounds , or thereabouts ; there was 96 Guineas carried to the Bank , and 8 Guineas and half a Moidore , I found at an Aunts of this Lads in Black-Fryars , he told his Master that he had lodg 'd them there . When I came down and found my House broke open , I saw upon the Table by the Bar , the Marks of his Feet , and the two bends of his Knees upon the Top of the Leads over the Bar . He endeavour 'd to take out one Pane of Glass , but could not ; he then took a Pane of Glass out over that , and then open 'd the Casement . The Saturday Sen'night after , a Gentleman came to me about 9 at Night , and desired I would go and fetch a Constable , for he had got the Thief , and then we went into his Master 's Shop , and took him out , and had him to the Nagg's-Head Tavern , and we had there the young Fellow that had got the 18 Pounds , that he ( the Prisoner ) had left in his Hands . Mr. Brigg 's asked Shad , where he had the Money , and he said that he found it ; but before that , he had told Noel Gregory , that he had made Wigs for it , and then Mr. Briggs took him into another Room with his Master and another Gentleman . Court . Was you there ? J. Stepple . No . The Sunday Morning I went to him to the Compter , and told him , that I was sadly afraid , that he had impeached an innocent Person , and that I had very good Reason for it ; that if a Person had been concerned with him in the Robbery , he would not have taken the Bag of Silver for his Share ; and then he cried , and said , his Life laid in my Hands , and he then confess 'd , that the Person that he had ask 'd him what he had done with the Bagg of Silver , he said , he had hid in under the Roof upon the Leads of the Church , Event the next Morning and took him one of the Compter , and got a Carpenter , and we went and took up a couple of Boards according to his ( the Prisoners ) Direction , and we found it , and he ( the Prisoner ) was with us when we found it . Court . Did he mention in what manner he got into the House ? John Stepple . Yes Sir , at the Sun Tavern , on Monday , he laid , that he went to an Ivon-mongers , and bought a Chissel the Night before , and said that he got upon the Table underneath the Bar , and got up the Bar , and with his Nails he would the Lead of the Window , and came down , and broke the Drawer-open .

What Time of Night did he say it was ? John Stepple . He said it was pretty near 3 o'Clock ; I ask 'd him how long he was about it , and he said he was about a Quarter and half a Quarter of an Hour , from the Time of his going out of Bed , 'till the Time he got in ; and he said he took up the Lad that laid with him , 3 Times in his Arms , and threw him down upon the Bed to try whether he would awake . Prisoner . I would ask him whether I ever told him , that I took the Lad up 3 Times and threw him down again to see whether he would awake or not . John Stepple . He said he did to see whether he would awake before he went out . John Peisley . My Lord the Prisoner at the Bar is my Apprentice , and last Saturday was 7 night he was taken up for robbing Mr. Stepple , and was taken to the Nagg's-Head Tavern .

Accordingly I went and found it , and brought it back to the Tavern , and Shew 'd it them , and he ( the Prisoner ) said , that that 100 l.

Guilty , Death . 20. William Bury , alias Henry Parminter , was indicted for marrying Mrs. Sarah Proctor , a second Wife , Sept. 27 , 1739 , his former Wife being now living . The Counsel for the Prosecution in opening the Charge , took Notice that Mrs. Proctor came from her Brother 's in Somersetshire , and lodged at Mrs. Davidge 's a Milliner in Covent Garden , where the Prisoner came acquainted with her and married her , and pretended to be a Person of very considerable Fortune ; that as he understood her Fortune was not very large , and that as he had a Dependance on an Uncle , therefore desir 'd it might be kept a Secret ; he promised he would bring a Friend to be Witness of the Marriage ; but when he came there was no body in the Coach with him , and the only Reason he gave for not bringing his Friend was , his Fear that his Uncle might know it . Mrs. Proctor was over persuaded , and went with him to Chelsea , and there was married . He took Lodgings for her , and owned her for his Wife , and wrote a Letter to the Brother of this Lady , in which he calls himself his Brother ; as one Artisice always wants another to support it , he thought proper to produce a Ring , in which was the Name of Parminter which he said was his Brother deceased , this Crime is of a deep dye ; because he had as good and virtuous a Wife as any Man . We shall bring the strongest Evidence to prove the Fact upon him , and doubt not but the Jury will find him guilt , of the Indictment . 2d Council . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury , I am Council on the same Side , this is an Indictment against William Bury , who went under the Name of Parminter , for marrying a second Wife ; and we shall prove he wrote a great many Letters full of Love , and afterwards broke open her Box and took them away , we have some of those very Letters to produce , some with , and some without a Name ; he told her she might enquire after him at one Mr. Burys , by the Name of Parminter , and said he had a very rich Uncle on whom he had a great Dependance , and therefore desired that the Marriage might be kept secret . On the 27th of Sept. 1739 , he drove the young Lady from Mr. Seaton 's in Suffolk-street to a House at Chelsea , and a Clergyman came and married them , he staid with her two Days , and then said he must leave her on account of Business ; he afterwards moved her from Lodging to Lodging , and the Lady seeing him uneasy in his Mind , asked him what was the Matter ? then he fell on his Knees and confessed the whole Fact ; we shall shew you this Gentlemen , in a full Light , and we doubt not but you will find him guilty . John Smith . This is the Register Book of Marriages for the Parish of St. Saviour 's Southwark , Oct. 13 , 1727 , William Bury and Anna Maria Fleetwood . Henry Parminter I was at the Wedding Dinner , and they have lived together ever since as Man and Wife , I have lodged in his House in Abchurch-Lane , he has two Sons living by her , I can not remember the Day not the Year , but it was about 12 or 13 Years ago . Sarah Proctor The latter End of May 1739 , I was first acquainted with him . That Man came to Mrs. Davidges and enquired for me , I did not see him the first Time , he came again the next Day , I went with him into the Parlour , and there he told me , that he saw me a going to my Brother 's , and asked who I was , and was told where I lived , on which he came to me , and there he declared how much he was in Love , and begged me to give him Leave to make me frequent Visits , which I refused , because he was a Stranger ; after that he wrote Letters to me every Day , without my answering any one of them , on which he sent a Porter to me with a Letter , declaring how much he was in Love , he begg 'd that if I would not give him Leave to come and see me , that I would meet him in Somerset Gardens , or the Park , he would often endeavour to get me into a Coach , but that I always refused till the Day I was married to him . He went by the Name of Henry Parminter , and he shewed me a Ring which he said was for his Brother William Parminter ; he often pressed me to go into some House or Coach with him , saying I might venture , for he was no Boy . We were to have been married at Richmond , where he said he had taken Lodgings for me , but I put it off till my Friends knew of it , then he let me know that he had taken Lodgings at Chelsea , and we were to be married there , and he consented to let Mr. Seaton in Suffolk-street go along with us , but at Night he sent me a Letter , and in it said , that as the Thing was to be kept private , he would have no body with him but his Friend Bury ; at 9 o'Clock I received this Letter , but I had before acquainted Mr. Senton that he was to go along with us ; he also said in the Letter , that he would bring a Friend along with him to be present at the Marriage , in the Morning he came there was none but that Man , ( pointing to the Prisoner ) in the Coach , I asked where his Friend was , and he said he would tell me in going along , which he did , and he said he was afraid Mr . Bury would tell his Wife , and then it would be blown . When we came to Chelsea we went into a House up Stairs , and there a Clergyman came and married us . Coun . Do you know it was Chelsea . Sarah Proctor . He told me it was Chelsea . I went to sit down in the Window , and he told me I must not sit down , and there that Man married me ( she produced a Ring ) and said , that is the very Ring which that very Man married me with . After we was married we went to the Hospital , and we din 'd at a Gardiner 's where we lodged , whose Name is Singleton . We staid 2 Nights and three Days there , and afterwards I went to Greenwich , and staid there from Saturday till Monday , he said he was obliged to go to Exeter on special Business , but he took Care to write to me every Post , that Man did ( pointing again to the Prisoner ) Exeter was stamp 'd on the outside of the Letters . He staid there a Month , and on his Return I told him , it was sitting that my Brother should know of our being married , I told him that several had wished me Joy ; why said he , several of my Friends have wished me Joy too . Counc . Do you know that ? S. Proctor . I know no more than that Man told me so . I wrote to him at the Bath , and he told me in a Letter , he had a Grandmother dead , and desired I would put myself in Mourning , and that he would let my Brother know of the marriage . Counc . When did you see him next , after he wrote about the Mourning ? S. Proctor . I did not see him till about the 14th of January . Counc . Where did you see him next ? S. Proctor .

I was with Child when I went from Mrs. Davidge 's , and had about a quarter to go , and while I was there , this Man came to me , and told me , he would go to my Brother himself , and discover the Marriage to him , but instead of that , I had a Letter from him , that his Uncle must not know it ; after that he wrote to me , as from Rotterdam , when he came from Exeter , he came to see me , at one Mrs. Jones 's , where I then Lodged , he disliked the Lodgings , and desired me to remove to one Mrs. Williams 's , in New-North-Street , Red-Lyon-Square , and I was there about 13 or 14 Months , and was there deliver 'd of a Daughter now alive . He wrote to me several Letters , acquainting that he had something to tell me , that would shock me to the last degree ; when he came to me I desired to know what it was , whether he was in Debt , or had murder 'd any body , as to his being in Debt , he said he was , for he was bound for a Person now dead , in a large Sum of Money . I ask 'd him if this was true , and he told me , that there was something more than that , and then seeing him again , about 2 Months before I was brought to bed , he told me that he had something to tell me , that he must now let me know , with that he fell on his Knees , hung his Head down , and said that there he would remain till I bid him rise , says he , do you know where you directed your Letters to me my Name is not Parminter , but it is Bury , that he had suffered a great deal for me , and he begg 'd that I would keep it a secret , and said that as he had D - d himself for me , he hoped that I would not hang him , and that if I had no regard for him , I should consider what uneasiness it would be to my own Family , I let him remain upon his Knees , till he got up himself ; then he put my Hand up to his Eyes to feel his Tears , but I believe he had spit on his Fingers to counterfeit them , and then that Man , ( pointing to the Prisoner ) left me , and told me that if I made a Noise , he would never come near me again , and at last went away . Two Days afterwards I was taken exceeding ill , and that Man , came to see me , but I could not speak to him . Counc . After this Discovery , did he come to you again ? S. Proctor . He came 2 Days after and found me exceeding ill. Counc . Did he come two Days after he said he had d - d himself . S. Proctor . He did come two Days after he said he had d - d himself . Counc .

I did not discover it to my Friends first , but I was determined to discover it to his . Counc . Who did you discover it to first . S. Proctor . I discover 'd it first to one Mr. Shippen , who was an Acquaintance of that Man 's there ( pointing to the Prisoner ) that marry 'd me ; I discover 'd it afterwards to one Mr. Fleetwood in the Temple , Brother to his first Wife . Counc . How long was it after you lay in , that you discover 'd it . S. Proctor . It was about 3 Months after I lay in , after this , I saw him at Mr. Shippen 's , in Boswell court , and there I charged him with every thing , as I do now . Counc . Did he own it . S. Proctor . No Sir , he said he knew nothing at all of me , and that he had never seen me before , and called God Almighty to witness that he knew nothing at all of me . Counc .

The first Time I saw this Mrs. Proctor was by Accident , I met her in Cannon-street , she had a Hat over her Face , I took her by her Air to be a Mistress of the Town , I followed her , and spoke to her , and asked her Name , which she immediately told me ; I asked her to drink a Glass of Wine , she said she could not then stay , and was going to a Persons in the City , but I live says she at Mrs. Davidges a Milliner , at the 3 Flower-Pots in Tavistock-street , Covent-Garden , and there you shall be welcome to drink a Dish of Tea ; in 2 or 3 Days after I went to see her , the first Time she was not at Home , the second Time I found her at Home , and we drank Tea together , when we had so done , I told her I should be glad of an Opportunity of seeing her abroad , and she said , if I would send a Message to her she would come , or let me know why she could not by a Letter . I told her to direct her Letter to Mr. Parminter , to be left at my House , that if the Letter came directed to me it might fall into my Wife 's Hands , and the Thing would be discover 'd ; upon this she directs a Letter to Mr. Parminter , to be left at my House , which my young Man received , and gave to Mr. Parminter , who afterwards told me he had received such a Letter , but could not tell what to make of it , but he thought it might come from an old Mistress of his . After this I sent a Porter to Mrs. Proctor from under the Piazza 's in Covent-Garden , and she came to me , and said that at Time she was very busy , that if I came another Day she might be more at Leisure . The next Time I sent a Porter again , and she came to me , and I called a Coach , and we went to a Bagnio , I took her up into a Room , and told her here we was private , and might stay all Night ; she did not deny me any sort of Freedom , ( I must do her that Justice ) I sent a Porter another Time , and she came to me , and said , if you will get me a Lodging I will go with you . This second Time I had her out to the Park , and walking near Rosamon d's-Pond there was some Trees cut down , which serv 'd us for a Bed , and there I told Mrs. Proctor my Name was Bury , and that I was a married Man , and said , if you will give me the Pleasure of your Conversation I shall be very much obliged to you , from that Time she sent Letters to me directed to be left at Will 's Coffee-House , Cornhill . After this I went up to Jenny 's Whim at Chelsea , and I asked the Man of the House to get me a Lodging , and I declare I did say that it was for my Wife , and I should bring her next Week , it was at Mr. Singleton 's . The next Week she went with me , I called upon her at Mr. Seaton 's in Suffolk-street , there was two Ladies at the Door , and we drove to Chelsea , went to the Whim and bespoke a Dinner ; I enquired how long it would be before Dinner would be ready , and in the Interim we took a Walk in the Garden , after that went to dine at Mr. Singleton 's where the Lodging was taken , and lay there two Nights ; then we came down by Water , I was landed at Billingsgate , and she said she was going to her Sister 's . Soon after that I went out of Town to Exeter , and saw no more of her till the Month of January , and indeed I heartily repent that I ever saw her ; I believe at Will 's Coffee-House I received 100 Letters from her . After I came to Town she sent a Letter desiring to see me , and that she must speak with me , or otherwise she would come to my House , accordingly I met her in Somerset Garden , and she told me a Story of her being under great uneasiness , because Mrs. Davidge had discovered that she did not come to her Brother 's House till Saturday Night , and she said that made her very uneasy ; I asked her if she could go out with me to Night , she said she would go with me any where , I then said we will go to a Bagnio , the next Morning I brought her Home again . This was the second Time we had been there , and the Woman Waiter gave her a Handkerchief she left there the Time before . Some Time after this about Midsummer , she said she was out of Order , and was with Child , and that Mrs. Davidge had a Suspicion of it , says I , I am very busy now and left her . I met her a second Time , and she said that Mrs. Davidge has intercepted some Letters , that she was big with Child , and threaten 'd to tell her Brother of it ; she said that her Mistress had 40l . with her when bound Apprentice , and that she expected 20 l. more if she quitted her Service . Says I , you must see and moderate the Matter with your Mistress ; however I was to meet her again , and when I met her she told me that she had prevailed on her Mistress to take 12 Guineas , says I , you should speak to your Brother , it is a most abominable Imposition on me ; she wept , and asked if I would let her have the Money , says I , I will give you 6 Guineas , which I did then give her to get rid of her ; afterwards she told me at another Time that she had brought her Mistress down to 10 Guineas , and I gave her 4 more , and then she said she would look out for a Lodging , which when she had done she sent to me to come to her there , I saw it was a little poor Lodging , and she said she did not intend to stay there , and would look out for another . After this she sent me Word that she had found another Lodging , but refused being taken in except somebody knew her , she said she had mentioned my Name , I went up there , and the People of the House asked me if I knew one Mrs. Proctor , I said , yes , and then they took her in ; after this she grew near her Time , and when she was brought to Bed she came to me , and asked me to go and see the Child , I said it was no Business of mine , and I did not go to see her for 6 Weeks or two Months after , and then the Child was at Nurse in at the next Door ; she would have sent for it for me to see it , says I , I do n't want to see the Child , in short , she prevailed with me at last to go and see it , and there the Nurse was , and that was the only Time I ever was there . After this she came to me , and said her Brother would be reconciled to her if I would go and tell him that she was married to Mr. Parminter , Parminter ! says I , how can you mention such a Name , Mr. Parminter is a first Cousin of mine , says she , if you will write a Letter in the Name of Parminter that will satisfy my Brother , I shall go out of Town and never return again ; why , says I , a Thing of this Nature may be of ill Consequence , Mr. Parminter is in London , and will ( provibly ) find it out , but however , by her Intreaties and Tears I was at length very foolishly brought to a Compliance , and I wrote while she was by me , and directed it , she would have me send it myself , and I said no , at the same Time I wrote Letters to her in the Name of Parminter , as from Rotterdam , there was no Post Mark upon those Letters , that I wrote them is very certain , and this she said would satisfy her , accordingly I did do it , and heard no more of her till some Days after ; then she told me her Brother was not yet satisfied , but insisted upon seeing me , who was a supposed Friend of her Husband 's , says I , I do n't know your Brother , if he will not believe it I ca n't help it , says she , why will you not be so good as to go , it is but to Crutched-Fryers ; at last one Morning I went , and waited for him , he came down , then I told him I waited on him at the Desire of his Sister . Sister , says he I say Sister , Sister tells me many Stories of a Cock and a Bull , and tells me of being married to one Parminter , but I do not believe any Thing about it . I said if he did not believe it 't was no Fault of mine . After this she came to my House , and found me at Home , and said if I would write her a Letter of Recommendation , it would help her off with the Child ; accordingly I did write a Letter , and in it represented that I knew her , and thought her an Object of Compassion , ( whilst I was writing this my Wife came into the Compting-House ) and told her this is the last Thing I can or will do for you , and when I had so said she went away , and I saw or heard nothing of her till 3 Months after that , when Mr. Shippen acquainted me that a Woman told him a Story about a Bond ; after that she desired to see me there , accordingly I went , and there she run on a rig-me-roll Story , and said , that I had married her at Chelsea ; when she charged me with it , I flew into a Passion , and quitted the Room , or otherwise I might have done her a Mischief . Mr. Shippen afterwards asked me why I could not keep my Temper , says I do n't talk to me , I happen 'd only to pick her up as a common Woman , afterwards she went to my Brother-in-law 's , but however he did not think fit to send to me , but when he saw me told me , that there was a Woman that said she was married to me but bid me take no Notice of her , for he supposed she only wanted to get a little Money out of me . After this I heard no more of her , till she had applied for a Bill of Indictment , which was in January last , the Sessions passed over and no Notice taken of it , at last brings a Warrant to Mr. Shippen , here is says she , a Warrant , and if he does not comply he will be taken up in in two or three Days Time . Mr. Shippen after told me of this , and I could not believe it ; says he , you must go and enquire , and upon Enquiry I found it was so , and when I found it , I immediately gave Notice of Trial , why , says my Brother , says he , they only want a little Money of you , you had better give it them . No , says I , as it is made public I will at all Events bring it to a Hearing . James Legg . sworn . ( seeming much afflicted with the Palsy . ) Coun . What is your Business ? Legg .
