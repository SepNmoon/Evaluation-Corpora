I have done nothing but what I will do again , that Riley hearing him call Fitzgerald , spoke to him in Irish , thinking him an Irishman by his name , but he did not understand him , not being so . That Riley persuading them not to expose them offer 'd to give them a Note of 10 l. to forbear , and said that Bowes should make it up Twenty ; that he being unexperienc 'd , and not thinking of delivering them up at the Round-House , did go with them to a Womans House near Charing-Cross , whom Mr. Bowes knew , where he asking the Woman if she knew him , she reply 'd yes , and had for these Twenty Years , upon which he requir 'd her to trust him half a Crowns worth of Drink to make him and the other Person drink , but she refusing to do it , two Pots were call 'd for , which the Prisoners neither of them having money they were forc 'd to pay for it themselves , that from thence they went to Mr. Vickers a Constable at the Angel and Crown in Hedge-Lane , where there was some offers to make it up , and the other Person Burridge , inclining to it , he did hearken to their Proposals , but being dubious in his mind did not , and that there being an offer of 10 l.

A Surgeon depos 'd that he being sent by the Justice to examine Mr. Ryleys Posteriers , did so , and found the Spincter Muscle more Lax and Dilated than usual in a Person of his Age , which in Young Persons is generally more close and contracted , but how it might come , he would not take upon him to determine . Mr. Bowes in his defence deny 'd they were in Covert-Garden at all , he said that an acquaintance of his having newly set up a Tavern in the Strand , he went thither to drink a Pint or two of Wine with a Friend , and staid there till almost 2 o Clock , this was confirm 'd by the Drawer , who added he saw no immodesty acted by them there , and as he and Mr. Ryley , were coming home going toward Charing-Cross , two Men came up to them and charged them with being Sodomites , and called them abandance of names , and follow 'd them to one Mrs. Jacksons Cellar at Charing-Cross , that indeed he had no Money about him having spent it , but that he was formerly a Woollen-Draper in Pall-Mall but had left it off , and now liv 'd in Salisbury Street in the Strand .

He call 'd some Persons that had lain with him , and deposed they never had known him attempt any thing that was immodest , and that he had been Servant to Collonel Paget , and was a Person of good character and fair and honest in his dealings . He added that as to what the Surgeon had said be had been under an indisposition and taken Physick , which might cause that Laxness in his Body the Surgeon had spoken of ; and added that he himself desir 'd a Surgeon might search him , and called the Justice to prove it , which he did .
