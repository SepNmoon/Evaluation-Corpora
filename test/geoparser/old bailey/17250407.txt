Says he . If she is , send her down with a Candle . She beg 'd me to go down with her , for fear he should abuse her . I went ; He beat her , damn 'd her for a Bitch , and swore he 'd murder her . She ran out , and he after her ; but she got out of his Sight , and came back again without any further Hurt . Pray , Landlady , says she , if he comes again , tell him that I am not here ; for if he finds me , he 'll certainly be way Death . I hid her behind my Bed . He came ; I deny 'd her ; he swore , and went to Bed . When his wife thought he was asleep , she went into his Room to see how much he had spent of the Seven Shillings he took with him in the Morning . She came up , and said , I have found but Three-Halfpence ; I am afraid he 'll murder me , for he has found his Knife that I hid in my Box ; it lies by his Bed-side with a Bull 's Pizzle . Next Morning I went into his Room , and took the Bull 's Pizzle out of the Chair . He jump 'd out of Bed , snatch 'd it from me , and swore that he valu 'd his Pizzle as he valu 'd his life , and he 'd as soon lose an Inch of one as t'other ; for he kept it on purpose to pizzle the Bitch his Wife . I left him ; he dress 'd himself , came out of the Chamber , lock 'd the Door , and went away . His Wife between 6 and 7 in the Evening persuaded me to go with her to see for him at the Alehouse in Py-Corner : We went , found him there , and he was as good as his Word in exercising his Bull 's Pizzle upon her . I left her , and she follow 'd me in a quarter of an Hour . I blamed her , as her Life was in Danger , for not securing him , as he had been secured before in New-prison for abusing her . He came home soon after , and said I will make you , know , you Bitch that you shall follow me any more , for I am marry 'd to little Jenny . Well , Davis , said she , if it is so , I ca n't help it ; but neverthless , let us drink together and be Friends , for there 's none in Heaven , or Earth beneath , that I love better than you ; and therefore be married to who you will there 's nobody shall enjoy you has myself .

She went ; but it was not long before she came back with her Hand bloody , told me that he had cut her Fingers , and beg 'd me to leave my Chamber Door open , that if he came home and offer 'd to abuse her , she might run in there and save her Life . He came before I was gone to Bed , and in his usual Language call 'd to his Wife to bring him a Candle . She went to him , and I went to Bed . I heard him swearing at her upon the Stairs , she at the same time begging him to be reconciled , and be Friends with her . At last she ran up into my Room , and he after her , with his Butcher 's Knife in his Hand ; and there , without any Provocation given him , I saw him slab her into the Breast . I jump 'd out of Bed ; she ran down Stairs ; he after her , and I after him : He miss 'd her , and I found her at a Neighbour 's House , where she died about 12 o'Clock , which was about half an Hour after the received the Wound . Mary Jeffery this depos 'd : I live at the Tobacco-Roll , next door to Mrs. Tindall , ( the last Evidence ; ) there 's only a thin Partition betwixt their Stair-Case and mine . I was going to Bed between 11 and 12 o'Clock , when I heard a Disturbance in her Room , and a Noise of two or three People running down Stairs . I ran down too , and open 'd my Door , to see what was the Matter . The Moon shone on one side of the Way , but the other was shaded by the Houses . The Deceased came to my Door , which was in the Shade , crying she was stab 'd , and beg 'd me to let her in , when Immediately I saw a Man run from the shady side into the Moon-light , with a naked Knife in his Hand , which I then thought appear 'd bloody . I took the Deceased in ; she sat down upon some Leaf Tobacco , and show 'd me her Wound ; but I could not bear to look on it . Mrs. Tindall and some other Neighbours came in . The Deceased cry 'd , He has killed me ; for God 's Sake , call somebody to seize him , and do n't let my Blood lie at your Doors . He runs about ( says one of the Neighbours ) with a Knife in his Hand , and swears , that he 'll kill the first Man that touches him . He was brought in soon after by the Comfortable and Watch , and looking upon his Wife , Ha ! says he , she is not dead yet . - Betty ! speak to me !

My Master do n't allow Women to go up Stairs ; but they looking like civil People , I thought there might be no Hurt in it . They call 'd for three Pints of Wine ; by which time , I saw enough in their Behaviour to convince me that she was a Woman of the Town . The Man grew drowsy . Honest Friend , says I to him , have a Care what you do ; and have a Care of your Money , if you have any about you Money ! says he , Yes , I have 40 l. and more , and so let us have t'other Pint .

Pish is the Man a Fool ? says she , and wink 'd upon me ; Do n't you know your Business Ca n't you take the Money and be quiet ? I still refused it ; and her pressing me to take it , gave me a strong suspicion that she had pick 'd the Countryman 's Pocket , and so I told her : She grew angry , and would have gone away ; but I was resolved to keep her till I had awaked him , and made him examine his Pockets ; which , when he had done , he found that she had pretty well emptied'em . I sent a Porter for the Beadle , who carry 'd her to the Round-House . - Halliwell the Constable thus deposed : I stript her at the Round-House , and search 'd her in every Place .

At last , with great Importunity , and much against my Will , I went with him to the Tavern , where we had five Pints of Wine . He press 'd me to go to his Lodgings at the White House in Piccadilly , and he with him all Night , and from thence with him into the Country ; but I told him I was no such Person . My Dear , says he , if you will but go , you shall want for nothing : I have Money enough , and do n't value 30 or 40 l. and if you think I wo n't be as good as my Word , I 'll give it you now . And so he pull 'd out his money and threw it into my Lap . And I am so far from being guilty of this that .

I search 'd her , and took the Watch upon her , which he said was his ; but that he could not swear to the Money . The Prosecutor not appearing to prove the Felony , the Prisoner was acquitted . Susan Edwards , of S. Bride 's , was indicted for privately stealing a Watch . val . 35 s. and 5 s. in Money , the Goods and Money of John Odell , on the 4th of March last . John Odell , thus depos 'd : I had been drinking part of two or three Pints of Wine , besides other Liquors , at Mr. Lewis 's , the Bull-Head at Tottenham Court ; from whence , about Three in the Afternoon , I came into Shoo-Lane , where the Prisoner lived . I had seen her several times before ; and the last time I was with her , she made me promise to call upon her when I came that Way ; and so I was willing to be as good as my Word . When I came in , she was in Company with two or three more Women ; but they went away . I felt her Hand about my Breeches , and ask 'd if she had a mind to pick my Pocket . We drank Brandy ; and I went away at Five o'Clock . I did not miss my Watch till I came to Smithfield ; and then I went back and demanded it . She deny 'd it , began to call me Names , and was for pushing me out of Doors . I consider 'd that it grew late , and that I had eight Miles home to Whetstone ; and so I left her for that time . I came again next Saturday , and threatned to fetch a Constable and send her to Newgate ; and then she told me , if I 'd give her a Guinea , she 'd help me to it again ; But I would not comply to that , tho ' I could not tell what Course to take ; for I did not care to tell any body , for fear my Wife should hear of it . So I went home and consider 'd of it , and came again next Saturday , and then she took me to the Eagle and Child , where Lewis Lefevre , her pretended Husband , and two or three more Women , came to her ; and then she told me that the Watch was in Pawn for a Guinea ; and except I would give that , I should never have it . So I was forced to treat 'em , and go without my Watch too , which I was not very well pleas 'd withall . Whereupon , I began to think with myself , This wicked Jade puts upon me , because she sees that I am a Man in Tears , and do n't much care to have the thing known ; but that sha n't save her , for I 'll tell my Wife of it myself . So home I goes , and tells her that I had committed a great Fault , which I was very sorry for , but I would make her Amends for time to come ; and then I let her know the whole Concern . Mrs. Odell thus depos 'd ; I went with my Husband to the Prisoner , and demanded his Watch . The Prisoner told me it was at Pawn ; and if I 'd give a Guinea to redeem it , I should have it ; but otherwise , not . Upon this Confession , and Refusal , I sent for a Constable , and gave him Charge of her . Abraham Lewis the Constable thus depos 'd ; I heard the Prisoner own that the Watch was pawn 'd , and the Money spent ; and as I was going with her to the Justice 's , she would needs call in at an Alehouse , where , when we had sat down a little while , a Woman , who was one of her Neighbours , came in with something wrapt in a Paper , and laid it on the Table , and went away again . We open 'd the Paper , and found the Prosecutor 's Watch . Guilty val . 10d . Transportation . Walter Pritchard , of Aldgate , was indicted for stealing 43 Guineas , the Money of John Radbourn , and 20 Guineas the Money of Samuel Stanfield , on the 26th of March last . Samuel Stanfield thus depos 'd : Mr.Radbourn kept a Compting-House at Mr. Lucas 's , a Packer . I left the Money in a Bag in the Desk when I went to 'Change ; and returning in Half an Hour , I found that it was broke open , and that the Money was gone . I enquired of Mr. Lucas it any body had been there . He told me no body but Mr. Radbourn 's Footman , ( the Prisoner ) who was just then gone up into the Press-Room . We followed , and found him bid behind one of the Presses , I pulled him out , and he dropt the Bag from him . This was corroborated by the Deposition of Mr. Lucas . Guilty . Transportation . William Stainbank , of S.

And William Field , Senior , of Bishopsgate , was indicted for receiving the said Sheet and Handkerchief , Knowing them to be stoln . Abraham Mendez , a Jew , thus depos 'd : The Prisoner Sarah had been my Servant two or three Months . I gave her a Strict Charge never to open the Parlour Windows in a Morning before some other of the Family were come down Stairs , for fear some valuable Goods which I had there might be lost . But the Morning in which I was robbed , she got up earlier than ordinary , and opened the Parlour Windows betwixt 5 and 6 , which was soon after the Watchman went off . I had a little black Girl in the House , and the Prisoner sent her into the Kitchen to light a Fire , which was not usual . My Daughter coming down Stairs , the Prisoner heard her , and cry 'd out , Thieves ! The House is robb 'd ! One of the Slashes was thrown up , and the Window Cushion was sandy , but seemed rather to be thrown on for a Pretence , than to be the real Mark of a Foot that had entred at the Window . Most of the Prisoner Sarah 's Cloaths were sent away just before this Robbery , the Prisoner William being the Person that brought Sarah to me , and pass 'd for her Father . I took an Officer and searched his House , where we found a Cambrick Handkerchief and a Sheet of mine , but can not be positive that they were lost at the same time as I lost the Candlestick . Isaac Mendez depos 'd to the same Purpose , and the Constable confirm 'd the finding of the Sheet and Handkerchief . The Prisoner Sarah thus defended herself . My Master bade me get up earlier than usual , which I did , and opened the Parlour Windows , not thinking any Hurt . I ordered the Black Girl to make a Fire ; but she being awkward at it , I went into the Kitchen , and staid Half an Hour to instruct her . When I came up again , I miss 'd the Silver Branch out of the Parlour . I was frightned , and screamed out , and just at that instant my young Mistress came down . William Field called several Creditable Persons to speak in his Behalf , who gave him the Character of an honest , industrious Man , but unfortunate in his Children . That he was a Shoomaker by Trade , and had been Clerk of a Dissenting Meeting . Both acquitted . James Steward , of Aldgate , was indicted for stealing a Silver Tankard , val.5l . the Goods of Henry Walden , on the 19th of March last . John Leaper thus depos 'd : On the 19th of March , the Prisoner offer 'd to sell me a Tankard , which he said he bought at Newcastle three Weeks ago ; tho ' I afterwards heard that it had not been lost above one Week . I had formerly , by means of an Advertsement , stop a Tankard that was stolen from Mr. Walden , at the Three Tuns in Portsmouth ; and finding the Initial Letters of his Name upon this that the Prisoner had , I suspected that it came from the same Place . I question 'd the Prisoner about it . He told me it I was uneasy , he would quickly bring some of his Neighbours to his Reputation , for he lived but hard-by . In about half an Hour he returned with two Women , who said that he was a very honest Man , and that it was his Business to buy old Silver . This did not satisfy me . I charged a Constable with him , and forthwith wrote to Mr. Walden , advising him that I had stopt a Piece of Plate , but neither mentioned that it was a Tankard , nor what Marks it had . He returned me an Answer the next Post , that he had lost a Tankard of such a Weight , such Marks , and described the suspected Person : All which Particulars agreed with the Prisoner and this Tankard . John Batchelor , Servant to the Prosecutor , thus depos 'd : On the 12th of March last , the Prisoner , whom we never saw before , came to my Master 's House , called for a Tankard of Beer and a Pipe ; he empty 'd them both , and went away . Next Morning he came again , drank and smoak 'd as before , and went out , and returned in the Afternoon , and called for t'other Tankard and Pipe . Soon after he was gone , we miss 'd the Tankard , but never saw after him any more . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he bought the Tankard for 2 s. l5 s. on the Road from Portsmouth near Port Down Guilty . Transportation . Elizabeth Colstock and Thomas Chandler , of S.

James Barrance , of Aldgate , was indicted for stealing 2 Guineas , the money of Sylvester Davy , on the 5th of March last . Guilty Transportation . Bryan Smith , of Covent-Garden , was indicted , for that he , being an Evil-disposed Person , greedy of Gain , and not regarding the Laws of this Kingdom , did , after the first of June , 1723. that is to say , on the 28th of January last , knowingly , wilfully , and feloniously send a written Letter , dated Jan. 27 . 1724-5 , and signed by the fictitious Name of John Brown , to Antonio Lopez Suasso Esq ; commonly called Baron Suasso , demanding the Sum of 27 l. and on Refusal thereof , threatning to burn the House , or take away the life of the said Antonio Lopez Suosso Esq ; Thomas Brady thus deposed : Before I was apprehended , my Lodging was at Philip Godfrey 's in King's-Court in Russel-street , Convent-Garden . My first Acquaintance with the Prisoner was by the Means of Bartholomew Brady , who being since Michaelmas last convicted in this Court of stealing a Silver Spoon from Thomas Jackson at the White-Lion Tavern the Corner of Cornhill , he was carried back to Newgate , and there lay in Expectation of being transported . Hereupon Bryan Smith writes a Letter to the Prosecutor Jackson , which he afterwards read over to me , for I can neither write nor read . I ca n't call to mind the Particulars ; but I remember there was a great deal of Mischief threatned to Jackson , if he did not use Means to prevent the Transportation of Batt . Brady . Whether or no Jackson made any Application to the Court in Behalf of Batt . is more than I can tell : But it happening that Jonathan Forward left him behind , there was no persuading Smith but that his Letter was the Occasion of it . He grew very much elevated , and valued himself mightily upon his Ingenuity and Management ; so that soon after he was resolved to try if he could not procure a sum of Money by the same Means . He consulted with me about a proper Person , and or last we pitched upon Baron Suosso-Accordingly , on the 27th of January , he sends for me to the Sum Alehouse in King's-Court , where , when I came , he agreed to write a Letter to the said Baron , demanding 27 l. to be paid to me ; called for Pen , Ink and Paper , and began to write ; but when he had wrote three or four Words , he did not like the Ink , for it was very yellow . Whereupon I steps home to my Landlord , and brought some that was blacker , with which he finish 'd the Letter . He read it over to me , and I remember that in it he desired the Baron to pay 27 l. to one of my Lodgers . or else he swore he 'd be the Death of him , or burn his Country Seat , and concluded with some such Words as these ; I never shamm 'd it with any body , and my Name is John Brown ; and he directed it as he told me , To my Lord Baron Suass in the Old-Jury . He sealed it up , and gave it me to carry to the Penny Post Office . I accordingly carry 'd it to Mr. Tenant 's , a Distiller 's Shop , the Corner of Bridges-Street , in Russel-street . Since which , he enquired of me several time if I had received no Answer ; and I told him that I had heard nothing . But not long after , a Man came about Noon to enquire for me at the Alehouse , while I was there . I being a little in Debt , was afraid that it was a Balliff , and so slipt out and went home . The Man came again at Night , met with me , and told me that he came from John Brown ; and that he should be glad to meet me next day about Three in the Afternoon at the Kings's-Arms Tavern in Covent-Garden , for he had some Money to pay me on the Account of John Brown . I went thither , was apprehended , and committed to Newgate . While I was there , the Prisoner came to me and bid me fear nothing ; for , says he , There 's no Langer ; and if you can but 1keep your own Counsel , you 'll come off well enough . The Letter was produced in Court ; and this Evidence deposed , that he verily believed it to be the same Part of the first Line , being wrote with a yellow luk , very different from the rest . Benj Hawkins , the Penny Post Man , being shew 'd the Letter , thus deposed : by the Date of this Letter , and Tenant C being wrote upon it , ( which I know to be my own Hand ) I am positive that on Wednesday the 27th of January I took this Letter from Mr. Tenant C , and carried it to the proper Office at Charing-Cross ; for I write Tenant C upon all the Letters that I take from thence . David Curiel Abasse thus deposed : I live at Baron Suasso 's , and received the Letter , now produced in Court , by a Penny-Postman , on the 28th of January , about Ten in the Morning : The Baron was then out of Town ; but coming home at Night , I then gave it him ; and I read it myself the next Morning . Antonio Lopez Suasso thus deposed : On the 28th of January , at Night , I received this Letter from Mr. Abasse . When I began to read it , I took it for no other than a Petition for Charity ; but coming higher the End , I was surpriz 'd to find such imprecations and Threatening as I there met with . I advertised a Reward to any out that would discover the Person that sent it ; but that being unsuccessful , I employ 'd a proper Person to feign a Compliance with the Proposals in the Letter ; by which Means the Prisoner was detected . The Letter to Jackson was produced , and appeared , by the Hand-Writing , Irish Blunders , Imprecations , and Spelling , to be the genuine Work of the same Author that wrote the other to Baron suasso : Which last was openly read in Court , and is literally as follows : Janry the 27th 1724/5 . Me Lord THis is to let your Lordship Know that I am A poor unfortuneate Gentellman that I is Indept Indepted to my Tealer the sum of Seven And Twenty pound and should not Give your Lordship this Truble onely that present nesesary Compeells me to do it I am soe hared Pursud for this mony that I dare not Show my Face in the day thime and baveing of Your Lordships Goodness noeing that you are a parson that dus not vallue suoh a small matters that to Releve a person in Great Distress which Dept shall be Return 'd Honourably In a little Time to Your Lordship this person that I Owe this Money to is one Thomas Brady Liveing in Kings-Court in Russel Street be Drury lane pleahouse and if Your Lordship pleases to pay this mony to my Creditor thomas Brady I shall Be for Ever oblidge to your for I have no other Dependence other wise Your Lordship may Depend upon it if this money be not paid to this Mr. Brad liveing at Mr. Godfrees In the Court aforesaid God Dam my Blood if I donte be Revengd upon your Carkicees and speedily and if this money be not paid be Monday next God Etternally Dam my Blood if I doubt murther you some time or on other Either in town or in Contrey or if I cont ' not meet with your or gett any oportunity by God that made me Ill Burn your Contry Seat You need not ln Sist upon any other Teerms but wthat is In this letter I desire you may not Let mr. Brady Know of this writting or Devowlge it to any Person what Sum Ever this it all from me that never Shamd with any Body Yet my Name is John Brown . Your Lordships most obedt Servant in Distress . The Prisoner in his Defence deny 'd the Fact , and said , that he neither knew Baron Suasso 's City-House nor his Country-House ; and that the Evidence Brady was a Fellow of a very scandalous Character , and had been sent to the House of Correction for begging with a false Brief . He farther desired , that Brady might be ask 'd who it was that wrote the Taylor 's Bill for him in the Name of John Brown ? In Answer to which , Lawrence Plunket thus deposed : That Day that Brady was taken up , he came to me in a great Hurry , and begg 'd of me to write a Bill for him . I went up into his Work-Shop , and wrote as he and his Men dictated . John Brown 's Bell , For two Suits of Duroy , one Suit of Cloth , and several other Articles , that came to about 27l . The Jury round him guilty . Death . Claude Anjou , of S. James 's Westminster , was indicted for breaking and entring the Dwelling-House of our Sovereign Lord the King , called S.

The Council for the King open 'd , that the Prisoner being frequently at the Lodgings where the Robbery and Burglary were committed , had from thence an Opportunity of learning not only in what Part of the Lodgings it was most likely to meet with extraordinary Booty , but what Time and which Way were most eligible for his Entrance . That after the Robbery , the Prisoner was suspected , by being observed to have several Medals , & c. John Graves , Constable , thus depos 'd : On Tuesday Night last , I took the Prisoner at Sadler's-Wells . When I seized him , he clapt his Hand to his Pocket , and I thought he was feeling for a Pistol ; but instead of that , he dropt this Purse with these two Gold Medals in it ; one of them has the City of Hamburg upon it , and the other the Effigy of the Princess Sophia ; this Silver Snuff-Box , this Toothpick-Case , and this Diamond Ring . Then I carried him before a Magistrate , where he confess 'd the Fact , and what he had done with the rest of the Jewels . Lucretia La Vienna and Dorothy Schroder , ( by a sworn Interpreter ) proved the Property of the Goods , which the Constable then produced in Court ; that the Robbery was committed in the Night-time between Friday and Saturday ; that it was a Ground-Room where the Entrance was made ; and at Eight o'Clock that Friday Night , the Sash of that Room was left shut down , and the Window-Shutters without were pulled to , but not barr 'd ; and at Seven the next Morning , they miss 'd the Goods , and found the Sash open . His Confession was read , and was to this Effect : Between One and Two in the Morning , I got over a Door into the Yard belonging to the Lodgings where I committed the Robbery : I open 'd the Shutters , threw up the Sash , and enter 'd thro ' the Window . I found a little Fire in the Chimney , with which I lighted a Piece of Wax-Candle that I had in my Pocket . I endeavour 'd to open the Scrutere with my Knife , but could not effect it . I looked about for something else , and seeing a Key hang by the Looking-Glass , I took it down , and it answer 'd my With . I stole from thence all the Goods that I am accused at : Some of them were taken upon me ; and at that time I dropt two Medals into the Pocket of John Barr , but without his knowledge . Others I disposed of to John Fairfield , an Alchouse-keeper in Black-Fryars , where I lodged . The rest I left there unknown to him in a Handkerchief upon the Bed 's Head . I saw the Advertisement in the Daily-Courrant , and thereupon resolved to go for Holland : But the Constable prevented me . The Goods were found according to his Confession , and produced in Court .

Transportation . Arthur Kenly , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 3 Shirts val . 40s . and 1 Cane with a Gold-Head val . 40s . the Goods of George Campbell , in the House of Archer Hudson , on the 3d of this instant April .

J. Clements thus depos 'd : The Prisoner Mary Stevens had been my Servant about 3 Months ; and on the 15th of July last , my Wife and I was going to Uxbridge Market , and for better Security , desired Mary Harris ( who worked in my Ground ) to stay in my House all Night . Mary Harris thus depos 'd On the 15th of July , about 7 in the Evening I left Work in my Master 's Garden , and came into his House , where I saw Lloyd and his Wife in the Kitchen with Mary Stevens , he making a Kite for the Children . I told Stevens that my Master would be angry if he knew that she let any Men into the House when he was abroad . She said it was hard if she could not speak to a Friend . About Ten o'Clock , she persuaded me to go to Bed , for she said the Child would be frightned to lie alone ; and for her part , she intended to set up all Night and wash . So about 11 o'Clock , I fastned all , the Doors and went to Bed , leaving the three Prisoners , 2 young Son of my Master 's and my Daughter , ( Whose Name is likewise Mary Stevens ) all together . Mary Stevens thus deposed : When my Mother went to bed , Mary Stevens the Prisoner went up Stairs , and brought down a Bundle in her Arms , and carry 'd it into the Wash -house . She came back , and call 'd Kate Lloyd ; and they unbolted the Door , and both went out together , Stevens having the Bundle . In about four Minutes after , Tom . Lloyd said he would go and bolt the Dear ; but he went out too . I thought he was only gone to make Water ; but staying longer than I expected , I went and bolted the Door myself ; and neither of em came there any more . Michael Stuck thus deposed ; An Advertisement being left at my House by Mr. Clements , I Soon after heard that such Persons as were therein describ 'd were seen at the Barr's-Head Inn in Braintree . I took Lloyd and his Wise at the Door ; but Stevens got away into the Field . However , by the Directions of Mr. Manning , I found her hid in a Ditch among some Bushes . Oh ! says she , as soon as she saw me . I deserve to be hang 'd , for wronging such a Master . Several of the Goods were found upon 'em . They confess 'd the Fact before the Justice , for which they were committed to Chelmsford Jail ; but afterwards removed by a Habeas Corpus to Newgate . It appear 'd by several Witnesses , that Katharine Lloyd was the Wife of Thomas Lloyd , at the time that the Robbery was committed . Upon which , the Court inform 'd the Jury that , according to the Laws of England , the Wife is entirely under the Power , Direction , and Influence of her Husband ; and therefore , whatever she shall act by his Direction , or with his Knowledge , the otherwise of a Capital Nature , yet it must not be imputed to her as a Crime ; but she must be acquitted . For as the Law gives Privileges on one side , it very justly grants Indulgences on the other ; and it would be hard , if a Woman must suffer for acting in Obedience to a Power that she can not resist . The Jury acquitted Kath-Lloyd , and found the other two Guilty . Death . Ann Wibrow , of S. Giles 's the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Shirt , a Napkin , the Goods of Michael Jones ; and a Gold Ring and a Handkerchief , the Goods of Richard Hanson , on the 30th of January .

Guilty Val . 10d . Transportation . Thomas Evans , of Stepney , was indicted for privately stealing from Anthony Ellens , three Guineas and fifteen Shillings , on the 9th of March .

But there being no Poof that he took it , the Jury acquitted him . George Purchase , of S. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing two Handkerchiefs , the Goods of Thomas Richards . Guilty 10 d. Transportation . Elizabeth Mason , of Shadwell , was indicted for stealing 15 Yards of Cloth , Value 9 s. 6 d. the Goods of William Cowen , on the 10th of March last . William Cowen thus depos 'd : I carry Cloth to sell about Streets . I met the Prisoner 's Husband , who was my Ship-mate : He bade me call upon his Wife , to see if she wanted nothing in my Way , which I did . I afterwards miss 'd a Piece , which I found where she had pawn 'd it . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : When the Prosecutor came to my House , he was very rude , threw me upon the Bed , and swore that he would do so and so , whereof I would not let him ; and then he said he would give me a Piece of Cloth to pawn , and he would spend all the Money upon me , and be merry , and do so and so ; whereof he gave me the Cloth , and I pawn 'd it , and we spent the Money ; and then , because I would not let him do so and so , he said he would swear a Robbery against me , whereof he did .

I know not whether they saw me or no , but they presently parted and went towards the Pales . I slipt on my Cloaths , and follow 'd with my Gun . The Prisoner stept to me with a Pistol in his Hand , and swore if I did not go back , he 'd shoot me . I was not sure that my Piece would go off , and so I retreated , and found two Deer lying dead , and they look 'd as if they had been torne by Dogs . In the mean time the Prisoner and Biddesford got over the Pales . It fell out that some Countrymen were coming by soon after without-side the Pales , ( for there 's no Foot-Path thro ' the Park . ) I cry 'd out Thieves , and they join 'd together to assist me . I got over the Pales , and there found another Deer with his Throat cut , and not quite cold . The Prisoner and old Biddesford took their Way towards Roger 's Ferry , and we pursued them . When they came to the Ferry , they turned about , presented their Pistols , and swore we were dead Men , if we came a Foot nearer . However , when they were gone off , we took a Boat after them : They landed at the Half-Mile Tree , ( about half a Mile from Kingston ) and we were not far behind them . Biddesford was shot in the Fields , and the Prisoner was taken in Kingston , with a Powder-Horn and naked Knife in his Pocket . The latter Part of this Deposition was confirmed by the three Countrymen that assisted C.George in the Pursuit . Guilty . Death .

I wash after asking her which Way she wash walking : And she made a Laugh upon my Faush , and told me to Newtoner's-Lane . Arrah Joy , ( shaid I ) you should always have Somebody with you , when you go sho far alone . She told me she would be after taking me with her , if I would give her any Thing . Arrah , my dear Shoul , ( said I ) you shall never fear but I will give you shome thing , if I have got nothing myself . Sho we went together ; but not having any Deshign to be consherned with her , I paid her Landlady a Shilling for a Bed . For it ish my Way to make Love upon a Woman in the Street , and go home with her , whenshoever I intend to lie alone . But ash to the Preceshoner , she wash after making me shit upon the Bed with her , and sho tumble together ; but I wash after shitting in the Chair , and then she was coming to shit in my Lap ; but I would not let her , and sho she shit beside me ; and then I wash hoping that she would be eashy ; but for all that she would not let me shit at quiet , for she wash after being concerned with my Breeches , and got away my Watch whether I would or no ; and I pulled , and she pulled ; and sho for fear she should get it from me , I let go my Hold , and went for a Constable , and he carried her to the Watch House , where he took the Watch upon her . He found it in a Plaushe that my Modesty wo n't suffer me to name ; for ash I am a living Chreestian , she had put into her * * * . The Constable depos 'd , that he took the Watch from the Prisoner . The Prisoner thus made her Defence : I met the Prosecutor under Newgate ; he took hold of me , and asked where I was going ? I told him to my Lodging in Charles-Street , and bid him go about his Business ; but he would follow me home . My Landlady opened the Door , and then I desired him to leave me ; but he catch 'd hold of her Hand , and said he would come in and drink , for he was as well acquainted there as I was So he called for two or three Quatterns of Brandy , and having no Money to pay for it , he pawn 'd his Watch to her for 5 s. He was so impudent , that we were both found to fall upon cut Knees to keep his Hands from under our Petticoats . Then he would have gone up to Bed with me ; which I refusing , he threatned to swear my Life away ; for he said he was an Irishman , and could swear farther than ten Englishmen .
