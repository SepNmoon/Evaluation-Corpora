I am servant to Mr. Kirby , I have known the prisoner 20 years , he came over from Antegoa at the same time as I came over with my master ; I asked him to dine with me , and it is a very hard thing if a man asks a person to eat a bit of victuals , that he must steal a silver spoon .

I took hold of her , and asked her where the handkerchiefs were that she took off the shopboard .

I was standing at Mr. Master 's door ( Mr. Wallis in the Poultry ) and saw Mr. Blake and another gentleman going along ; who should follow them but the prisoner and his partner , ( for he had another with him ) they walked backward and forward five or six times , which made me think they were upon no good design , and I saw the prisoner put his hand into Mr. Blake 's pocket , draw out a handkerchief , and put it under his coat . I took hold of the prisoner , called to Mr. Blake , and said , Sir , your pocket is picked ; he turned round to the prisoner , who had the handkerchief in his hand , and said , that is my handkerchief .

Peter Chapman , of St. George the Martyr , was indicted for stealing a silver tankard , value 5 l. the goods of Jane Burgess , March 14th . Jane Burgess . I lost a silver tankard the 13th of March , and on the 14th it was brought to my house . I do n't know that the Prisoner took it . Mr. Sellon . I keep a goldsmith 's shop in the Borough of Southwark . On the 14th of March last , the Prisoner came to buy a pair of silver buckles , and asked me , if I would take silver in exchange , and pulled out this piece of a tankard [ The body of the tankard was produced without lid or bottom . ] This appearing so very suspicious , I asked him his name , where he lived , and how he came by it ; he said , he bought it of a man for two guinea and an half . I sent for a constable , and carried him before Justice Lacey , who committed him for further examination , because he would not confess any thing : but when he was in goal , he sent to his brother and he brought Mrs. Burgess , and she owned the tankard . Jane Burgess . I am sure this is my tankard . Edward Wheatly ( constable . ) I carried the Prisoner before Justice Lacey , the Prisoner directed me to his brother , who lived in Queen 's Square ; I found him out , to the fellow 's great surprise , when I told him my business . He carried me to Mrs. Burgess 's at the Brown Beer in Devonshire-street . I was saying there , that I had taken a person who had stole a silver tankard ; she said , she had lost one . I saw a tankard there wrote round the bottom as this is : when I came back , I searched the Prisoner , and found in his pocket the bottom of a tankard wrapped up in his handkerchief , which appeared to be cut out . I asked him whether he cut it out himself ; he said yes , and that he cut it out of this tankard , and he said he took it out of Mrs. Burgess 's house , where he lodged . Justice Lacey 's clerk proved that he took the prisoner 's information in writing , and that he signed it voluntarily . The confession was read , where in he says , that he did feloniously take out of the house of Mrs. Burgess a quart silver tankard , and offered it to sale to Messrs . William Wright and Humphry Sellon silversmiths in the Borough of Southwark . Prisoner . I was in liquor when I signed it . Mr. Sellon . I believe he rather wanted a little liquor , than that he had too much of it , for he seemed to be very sober . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 194 . + Edward Ryan , was indicted for stealing a silver tankard , value 6 l. the property of Dorothy Udall , in her dwelling * house , March 25 .

This tankard was taken out of my house between eleven at night and one in the morning ; - I know this only by information , for I am a lame woman , and am never out of bed . Richard Udall . Just after the brewers had done starting beer , about twelve o'clock at night , I brought two tankards of beer to them , and left two silver tankards with them . Q . Is the prisoner one of the brewers ? Udall . No , he followed them under a pretence . Q . How many were there of the brewer 's servants ? Udall . There were twelve of them . Mary Catliff . I am servant to Mrs. Udall . On the 5th of March , after the brewers were gone , I went to the box where the prisoner sat , to take away one of the silver tankards , which were brought to the brewers . - The prisoner had one before him . Q . Did you see the prisoner there at that time ? Catliff . It was just such a ragged man , he would not let me see his face . I took the tankard that he had before him , to put upon the fire , to warm some beer for my mistress ; and he said , that is my beer ; I made answer , do you belong to the brewers , and he said yes : then I went away and left the tankard with the prisoner . Joseph Wonnell . On the 6th of March about 9 or 10 o'clock at night , the prisoner came into Mrs. Ashfield 's , where he lodged , took a tankard from under his coat , and desired her to put it up , and said , I beg of you not to let any body see it ; and he said , I desire you would not let Mr. Wonnell know any thing of it , but bury it under ground , and you shall have it for three or four pounds , and I will eat and drink it out . Q . What is the prisoner ? Wonnell . He is a lumper of ships , - it is called so in a vulgar way , but it is unlivering of ships . I said the next morning to his landlady , it was wrong in you not to stop the tankard , and the prisoner . The prisoner was secured , he took up a fork , and attempted to push it at the Justice , and he would have murdered him , I believe , if he had not been prevented . Prisoner . Did you ever see me deliver the tankard to Mrs. Ashfield ? Wonnell . I saw you deliver it to her , and I would not tell a lye . Ann Ashfield . The prisoner delivered the tankard to me . Q . Did he lodge at your house then ? Ashfield . He did a little before . Q . How long have you known him ? Ashfield . I have known him about a year off and on . When he came in , he said , I have got something for you ( I thought he was going to pay me some money that he owned me ) said I , this is place , Ned ; and I said I would not meddle with it . He left it with me , I was afraid it was stolen ; and sell a trembling and shaking . Said I to Mr. Wonnell , do you take it , for I know nothing of thieving , I never had any concern with stolen goods in my life . Q . What did you say when he brought it ? Ashfield . I said I would have nothing to do with it . He put it into my hand , and said , I should have it for three pounds . I said again I would have nothing to do with it ; but he left it with me . Q . Did he say any thing about your not shewing it to any body ? Ashfield . Yes , he said I must not shew it to any body . I kept it in the room where I lay till morning , and then I asked him how he came by it ; he told me he found it . I advised him to have it cried , but he did not do it . Alexander Farer ( a waterman . ) I was at Mrs. Udall 's about twelve o'clock that night , the prisoner was there , and lay with his head upon the table . The maid came and took hold of the tankard to put it upon the fire ; he said , that is my beer ; the maid said , do you belong to the brewers ; he said , yes , and I saw him lay his hand upon the tankard . Then I was called away to go with a fare , and saw no more . John Udall . The Justice came to Mrs. Ashfield 's house , and the prisoner struggled with me and collared me in the presence of the Justice , and I was almost strangled . He took hold of these tormenters . [ A flesh fork , used in taking meat out of a pot , was produced ] The prisoner jobbed this at the Justice 's throat , and if he had happened to have hit him with it , it would have killed him . Then we overpowered him , and he said if the Justice would let him sit down , he would not oppose him any more . Prisoner . I was going down to the water side to work , and found this tankard by the side of some sugar hogsheads . I saw the handle of a tankard , so I took it and buried it in a dunghill ; and the next day I went to my landlady Mrs. Ashfield , and told her I had found a silver tankard ; said I , shall I cry it or keep it . She said , what occasion have you to cry it , as you found it , keep it . And then I went and fetched it out of the dunghill , gave it to my landlady , and she put it under her bed . Q . ( To Ashfield ) Did you advise him to cry it , or did you advise him not to cry it ? Ashfield . I advised him to cry it . Prisoner . I have never a friend in the world but God and your honour : there is never an one in the court can give me an ill word . Ashfield . The Justice asked him where he found it , and the prisoner said he would not tell him . Guilty Death . [ Death . See summary . ] 195.

Joseph Uptebake . + On the 19th of Sept. Leekey , Robinson and I went out to rob ; and we met with the prisoner . + He was evidence in December Sessions against James Leekey , and William Robinson , who were convicted for the same robbery , and executed . See Sessions paper , No 1. of this Mayorality page 5 , Trials 13 and 14 . Q . Had you been concerned with him before ? Uptebake . Only in selling brass rings , no farther . When we met him , we desired him to take a walk with us . Q . Did he know what you were going upon ? Uptebake . I do n't know that he did . As we came by Mr. Thompson 's house ( just by Oxford Chapel ) we saw the door upon a jar ; Leekey went in first , and Robinson followed him in , with a candle he had in a dark lanthorn . Q . What time was this ? Uptebake . Between 8 and 9 at night Leekey came out with a bundle of wearing apparel up to his chin , and he let them tumble in the street . Leekey made use of some bitter imprecations ; and made Graham [ the prisoner ] take them up in his apron : and we carried them to one Elizabeth Cane [ she is now under sentence of transportation , for receiving these goods knowing them to be stole ] In the mean time news was brought to Graham that his wife was in labour ; and he went away while Leekey , Robinson and I sold the things . Q . How did you divide the money ? Uptebake . Between Leekey , Robinson and I. Q . Had the prisoner any part of the money ? Uptebake . I believe not ; I believe he had a pair of silver shoe buckles and knee buckles , that Leekey concealed . I know Leekey and he had some difference about them ( we did not know that Leekey had concealed them , till we saw the advertisement ) and they were going to fight about them , at Mr. Bradbury 's , the Black Horse in Church Lane St. Giles 's ; Graham said to Leekey had cheated him in pawning the shoe buckles and knee buckles ; and Leekey said , that then he was even with him , for Graham had cheated him of money , in selling brass rings for gold ones , in not giving him so much of the money as belonged to him . Q . How far was Graham off when the house was robbed ? Uptebake . I believe he was twice as far as the length of this court . Q . How came he to be so far off ? Uptebake . I believe he did not know what * enterprise we were going out upon . * Uptebake in the information he made before justice Poulson differs very much from what he swars now : for there he says , they agreed to go out together , and met for that purpose , and that the prisoner had part of the goods , and part of the money , which amounted to three or four pounds a piece . Q . Then how could he expect any part of the buckles ? Uptebake . I am convinced in my mind , he had only a part of them . Prisoner . Had you any design to put me into your information , till you was desired to do it by the high constable ? Uptebake . I did not know there was any occasion to do it upon such trifling affairs , because , I believe he did not know at first what we were going about ; afterwards I was informed that the prisoner was the principal instrument of my being taken up , then I put him into my information - He never committed any other robbery with me but this . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

William Bowen . On the 16th of April , between two and three in the morning , ( I was a little flushed with liquor , ) I went into a night cellar in the Strand , opposite to Somerset-gate , and asked for a pint of beer ; the persons who belonged to the cellar said , they did not sell any beer . The prisoner was there ( I was not so much gone , but I knew very well what I did ) I not being used to be out so late , and not used to drinking , fell asleep ; and my hat dropped off : I waked between four and five in the morning , and missing my ring , I charged Elizabeth Salmon , the prisoner at the bar , with it , she was in a very ragged condition , she did not use me with any ill language .

There was a drummer there , ( not in soldiers clothes , but in a drummer 's habit ) and he said , he believed no body there would take away my ring .

I can not but say the prisoner was very impertinent in her way ; I will say nothing but what is true , did not I offer you what was very fair , did not I offer to give you a crown ? I said , if the ring was pawned , I would give her a crown , besides what the ring is pawned for , and she d - n 'd her poor eyes , and said she knew nothing of the ring . Q . Have you any body that saw the prisoner take the ring from you ? Bowen . Yes , here are two witnesses . James Carter . I came down into this night cellar about five o'clock in the morning , and saw the prisoner take the ring off his finger , as he sat sleeping with his head upon his hand . Q . Why did you not acquaint him with it ? James Carter . I did not know but she might be in company with him , so I did not say any thing ; I had half a quartern of gin , and went away about my business . Q . What did she do with it ? Carter . She put it into her bosom : What she did with it afterwards I can not tell . Q . Do you know nothing what became of it afterwards ? Carter . There was a ring sold afterwards by her directions for a crown . I can not tell whether it was this gentleman 's ring . Sarah Mills . The prisoner took this gentleman 's ring off his finger , and gave it to the drummer that was there to sell . The drummer stood before her , while she took it off his finger . Carter .

Elizabeth Griffiths . I was setting in my shop about eight in the evening : Dorothy Buckles came in and asked if I sold handkerchiefs . I said , I believed I had none at her price , and bid her not tumble the goods . Then Booth came in , and repeated the words , do n't tumble the gentlewoman 's goods . She bid me a shilling for a handkerchief , and I bid her go about her business : then Dorothy Buckles tore a handkerchief off a line in the shop window ; and they both run away . I called out to some people to stop them , and they were taken . John Swan . I was standing at my master 's door ( a bookseller at Gray 's Inn gate , in Holburn ) and heard Mrs. Griffiths cry out she was robbed . I saw the two prisoners run as hard as they could . I took hold of Buckles , and desired a young gentleman to hold her while I went after the other ; and I took her : they said they had no money . Buckles owned they went out with an intent to steal . Booth said she was in the shop . Both Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 201.

Q . Did you know them to be the skins of those sheep Mrs. Carter lost ? Pickett . They were very badly marked , but according to the best of our opinion they are them ; they have a mark , but it is so blind that I could not be positive to the letters . Philip Brownscomb . I bought the sheep of S amuel Keep the 11th of March , there were 13 weathers and a ram . Q . Did you know Keep ? Brownscomb . I never saw him before that time in my life . Q . Are you a butcher ? Brownscomb . Yes - I carry on business for my self . Q . Was any body with Keep when you bought them ? Brownscomb . Yes , they that killed the goods ; Stone and Scals . Q . How came you to buy so many sheep of a man you never saw before ? Brownscomb . Some people said he was a very honest man , and a farmer . Q . Were the skins taken off when you bought them ? Brownscomb . Yes , and I gave a market price for them . Q . What did you give ? Brownscomb . I gave 17 d. a stone , I paid him 5 l. 16 s. 6 d. for them . Q . Where did you buy them ? Brownscomb . At the White Hart in Cable street by Rag-Fair . Q . Is that a usual place for them to be sold in ? Brownscomb . They were killed in a common slaughter-house . John Brownscomb . Stone came to me , and said , a countryman had brought some sheep to town to sell , for fear of being seized , to raise a little money for his landlord . And Scales said he knew the man had rented 200 l. a year , only he had been reduced , and he was certain the sheep were honestly come by . He carried us to Sam Keep , and my brother and I bought them : Kingsland was about buying them , but people told Keep , if he bought them , he would be flung out of the money . John Stone . I was hired to dress those fourteen sheep , and I dressed them , not thinking they were come dishonestly by ; and I had no more than the common price 3 d. a sheep . Keep sold them ; I do n't know how he came by them . William Scales . I had been to buy a beast , and saw Keep and Kingsland together at the Rose and Star in Mill yard , Goodman's-fields . Keep said , wo n't you drink with me ; I sat down and we had two tankards of beer . I happened to see Stone at work ; he had killed four of those sheep , so I lent him a hand , and killed ten of them . Q . What was Keep ? Scales . He was a clay carter . I always took him to be an honest man . Q . Was not he called a farmer ? Scales . I heard he married the widow Wood at Hackney , and kept a farm of 200 l. a year . Q . Did you tell Brownscomb this ? Scales . I do n't know that I told him so . Q . Did you hear he was broke or breaking ? Scales . He said he was forced to make some goods off to get some money to satisfy his landlord . Q . Did you tell Brownscomb so ? Scales . No , I did not tell him so . John Holland . I have a stall just by William Kingsland 's in Cable street , and Kingsland said he would do it for them all , Jack , Stone , and all ; for he knew the sheep were stole . Q . What do you think he meant by saying he would do for them all . Holland . My opinion is , that he thought they were stole , and knew them to be stole . And it is my opinion Keep would never have stole them , if it had not been for him . I do n't know what he meant by doing for them . Q . Who is Kingsland ? Holland . That is the gentleman [ pointing to the prisoner Kingsland . ] Q . Is Kingsland a butcher ? Holland . He is no butcher ; he suckles calves . Charles East . I know Kingsland is a very honest man . He desired me to carry some sheep skins to Mr. Cook in Barnaby Street . Keep delivered the skins out of the slaughter house to me ; and Kingsland stood by : and he came to me next day for money for the skins . Q . How did Kingsland come by the skins ? East . Very honestly , for what I know . One Robinson bought the skins ; they were sold for 18 d. a piece . The 14 skins came to a guinea . Q . Whose skins were they ? East . They were Keep 's skins . He may be an honest man , and he may not ; I never saw him in my life before . Q . What mark had the skins ? East . I do n't know what mark they had . John Hudson . Scales and East came to me and said , I might have a job . I asked what it was ; they said it was to carry some skins to Mr. Cook 's house . We carried them to him , but he did not approve of them : we went to Mr. Robinson , and he bought them at Mr. Cook 's house for 18 d. a piece . We went to a publick house , and Robinson paid a guinea for the 14 skins . Q . Who did he pay the money to ? Hudson . To Kingsland . Q. to Scales . What mark had these sheep ? Scales . There was a little red oker behind the pole of the neck , I saw no other mark . Q . What is Mrs. Carter 's mark ? Pickett . Her mark is R P , it was her father 's mark . Mrs. Carter , the person the prisoner stole the sheep from brought him , up from a child . I have known him all his life time ; and never heard any thing amiss of him before ; and I am sorry I have occasion to appear against him now . Christopher Woodham . I have known Keep forty years , and never heard any thing amiss of him before . John Howard . I am clerk to Justice Bourne of Enfield . This confession was made by Samuel Keep ; it was taken in writing , read over to him , and he signed it freely . [ The information was read . ] This information faith , that on Sunday the 10th of March 1744 , he stole out of a field called Fenny-Coats about 14 sheep , the property of the widow Carter of Enfield ; and drove them into Church lane , near White Chapel church ; where they were killed , by his order , by John Stone , and William Scales , and that he sold the carcasses to John and Philip Brownscomb for 5 l. 16 s. 6 d. and the fat for 15 s. 9 d. to the man who keeps the mulberry garden ; and that William Kingsland sold the skins in Southwark , and took the money for them . Taken before me the 10th of March , 1744 . - Bourne . Signed Sam Keep . Prisoner . They made me fuddled , and I can neither write , nor read ; and I did not know what I did . Q . Was he in liquor ? Howard . I believe he was quite sober . Keep said that Kingsland was with him the Friday before , and that he appointed to meet him * . * Mr. Howard did not say when or where they appointed to meet . But this seems to agree a little with what Holland says , that he believes Kingsland knew them to be stolen if he was not the instrument of their being stolen . Jonas Lawrence . I keep a public house . Keep came to me and wanted me to take the sheep into my yard , and mentioned Mr. Kingsland 's name . I said I would not do it . I told him I believed the sheep were stolen ; and I told him , if the sheep had not been stolen , I believed Kingsland would have come along with him , for he is a very honest man . Mr. Lessingham . I have known Kingsland forty years . He was servant to my father , and to me , and I always took him to be an honest man . He drove a cart as a scavinger , and has been in gentlemens cellars , where there was plate in plenty ; and I never heard any thing amiss of him . Keep , Guilty Death . Kingsland acquitted . 206. John Sommers , otherwise Sommerville , of Pancras , was indicted , for that he after the 1st day of May 1734 , to wit . on the 2d day of April 1745 , in a certain field or open place near the King 's highway , upon Edward James did make an assault , and in a forcible and violent manner the money of the said Edward feloniously did demand , with a felonious intent the money of the said Edward James to steal , take , and carry away , against the form of the statute , & c . Edward James . ( a black ) On the 2d of April about 10 o'clock in the morning , as I was going about my business , the prisoner stopped me in a field . Q . What business are you ? James , I am a trumpet - I have been in the King 's service , but I am not now . - I was going to pay some money to the woman at the Adam and Eve at Pancras . The prisoner said he wanted my money ; I said I had none for my self , nor he neither . ( I had 3 s. 6 d. in my pocket , and was going to pay half a crown away ) He struck at me with a bag , jumped upon me , and seized me . He pulled and hawled me , and tore all my clothes . I bid him let me alone , for he should get no good of me . And he said , you black son of a b - h I 'll be revenged on you , and finding he could get no good of me , he let me go , and went away . Then he came back , and attacked me again , laid hold of me , and said , you are not gone yet ; but he soon let go his hold and run . There happened to be a gentleman and his lady in the church-yard ; the gentleman said he saw all the action , and advised me to get an officer to take him up . Q . What did he strike at you with ? James . He struck at me with a bag with an empty cag in it . Q . What did he say when he struck at you ? James . He demanded my money . I had a young woman with me , and she bid him be easy ; and he struck at her , and knocked her down upon her back . Prisoner . I do n't know that ever I saw him in my life . Ask him what I had to strike the gentlewoman down with . James . He struck her down with his fist , but he struck me with the cag , and stripped himself naked to fight me , at the second attack ; and when he ran away , I followed him , and took him - the prisoner was not drunk . Mary Mustafer . On the second of April , Mr. James asked me to take a walk with him to Pancras , we met the prisoner at the bar , and he stopped us , and said , he would have money , and struck at Edward James with a cask or something in a bag ; and took hold of him by the waistcoat and shirt and pulled him first one way and then another . Q . What did he say he wanted ? Mustaser . He said he wanted money and revenge and he would have it by G - d. I believe he quarrelled with him about three quarters of an hour , then he went away , and came back again presently , and said , by G - d you are not gone yet , and money I will have before I go home . Q . What did you do in this case , when they were quarrelling ? Mustaser . I went up to the prisoner , and desired him to be easy ; and he struck me down . Q . Where did he strike you ? Mustafer . He struck me upon my breast . Q . What did he say to you ? Mustafer . I ca n't remember what he said , he bid me be gone or something like that . Justice Hole was by , and saw all the action done . Justice Hole deposed , That he had been taking a walk with his lady , and setting in Pancras church-yard , he saw the prisoner take up his bag and strike at the black , and struck the woman , who was with him ; and that he fell upon some persons who came by before , and they took to their heels , and run for it . Charles Turnell . When he was carried before Justice Poulson , he was very much fuddled , but he had no weapon about him . James Burgess ( the beadle . ) About ten o'clock in the morning , the Black said , he wanted a constable , for he had been ill used in the fields ; and the prisoner was taken ; he submitted himself and asked pardon : I believe he was in liquor . Justice Hole . I am sure , my lord , he could run as well as I could . Prisoner . I was very much fuddled ; I deal in liquors , and sell them in the country - I am an Irishman . John Davis . I have known the prisoner five or six years ; he used to deal in liquors . I take him to be an honest man , I never saw any otherwise by him ; he will get drunk now and then . Catharine Shaw . I have known the prisoner three years , he has the character of an honest labouring man , and I believe he would not hurt man , woman , or child . John Hawksley . The prisoner buys brandy frequently at my house : I give him credit more or less , he has dealt with me four or five years . I take him to be an honest man , and I ca n't conceive he would be guilty of any such thing . John Hatfield . I have known the prisoner some years , he has been my tenant ever since I have known him , and I believe him to be a very honest man . Mr. Wilson said , he had known him five years , always took him to be a pains-taking , hardworking man , and always bore a vast good character . Being asked whether he is apt to be quarrelsom when in liquor , he said , he is apt to be quarrelsom . Acquitted * . * Though the prisoner was acquitted of the assault with an intent to rob , he might have been indicted for an assault ; which would have been done , if it had not been compromised between the parties . 207.

Rachel Giles . I went out of town to Bristol to see my father last January was twelve month , and hired a room to put my goods in , at the house of one John Lewis . I staid till the 22d of March was twelve month following ; when I went into the room , I found that the hinges of my boxes were taken off , but the locks were all fast . I was informed by the landlord of the house , that it must be the prisoner ; for I had the fore garret , and the prisoner , her mother , and sister , had the back garret , but before I came home , they were moved out , for Mr. Lewis did not like their conduct ; I found some of my goods at one James Cobbeau 's , and Mrs. Cobbeau said , she had them of the prisoner : this copper coffee pot , and copper chocolate pot are mine . The prisoner and her mother helped me to put them up into the boxes , when I went out of town , and they helped me to put up my linen ; sheets , table linen , & c. I lost a large trunk of linen , the trunk was opened , and the linen taken out ; and I lost a large parcel of books , and a great many other things , I lost between 40 and 50 l. worth of goods . Helena Cobbeau . The prisoner told me she had pawned some things for a gentlewoman who is gone to Holland , so I went with her to take them out of pawn , about a month ago ; she said , they had been in pawn above twelve months ; and I bought this chocolate pot , and coffee pot of her . [ Mrs. Giles proved these to be her property . ] John Lewis . The prisoner lodged in my house , and she helped Mrs. Giles to put her things up , when she went out of town . I can swear to this chocolate pot being brought to my house by Mrs. Giles . Mrs. Caveac said the prisoner lived with her three or four months , and behaved extraordinary well ; that she went from her four years ago last June , but not out of any dislike . Five or six other witnesses , English , Dutch and French , some of whom had known her five , six , or seven years ; gave her a good character , two of them deal in lace , cambricks , & c. and have entrusted her with those sort of goods , which she used to carry out to their customers , but always behaved very honestly , and if she would , might have wronged them very considerably .

Thomas Parry . The prisoner brought these shoes to my master 's house to pawn , and I lent him 2 s. 6 d. upon them . I did not see there was an odd shoe till he was gone , then I thought they were stole ; I called stop thief , and run after him ; he owned he took them off the cutting board in the shop : but before the Justice , he said , he made them , and the reason of there being an odd shoe was , that he made one for a gouty foot . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping . See summary . ] 209.

William Bragg . I sent these goods from Bristol fair the 26th of July , to the Three Cups in Bread street , to be left there till called for by me . Q . Who keeps that house ? Bragg . One Roberts , and I found my clothes in the shop of Mr. Samuel Foster , about a week before Lady-Day . Q . How came they to Mr. Whaley 's house ? Bragg . How they came to Mr. Whaley 's , I know not . Samuel Foster . I live in Monmouth Street , I deal in clothes ; I was coming from the barber 's between 9 and 10 in the morning - about five or six weeks ago ; and Mr. Fraser ( one who keeps an oil shop , and a man of as good a character as any man in the parish ) called to me , and said , Mr. Foster will you buy any cloth ( this is the cloth that I bought of the prisoner at the bar ) said I , this is the wrong season of the year for such cloths as these ( they are kerseys or narrow cloths ) but I bought them of the prisoner outright ; for Mr Fraser is his brother-in-law . He said he was a book-keeper 13 or 14 years at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate street ; and 3 or 4 years a ticket-porter . Just as he had told me the price of the cloths , Mr. Lamb came in , and said , do n't buy those cloths , for I have had the price of them already , and I am willing to have them , as they are come honestly by . This made some words between Mr. Lamb and I , but we agreed to divide them , he had two pieces , and I two pieces . Q . Was not there another man in the shop who owned that the cloths were his ? Bragg . There was another man in the shop , whether he was with him or not , I can not say , but he did not say any thing about the cloths . I thought I bought them as fair as ever I bought any thing in my life . Q . Did the prisoner say how he came by them ? Foster . He said he bought them of an hostler at an inn ( I believe it was the Three Cups in Bread street ) but it was the inn he said he was porter at . Alexander Fraser . The prisoner came to my house with these cloths , and asked me how I did ; I said , pretty well . He laid the cloths down upon the counter , and said he wanted to sell them for a person who had a friend dead in the country ; and they were sent up to sell to raise a sum of money . And he wanted to sell them that afternoon . I sent for Mr. Lamb , and he looked at them . Mr. Foster came by the door at the same time . Said I , you may look upon these cloths , for you are a good judge of cloths ; so Mr. Foster and Mr. Lamb bought them , and had each of them 2 pieces . He was a porter at the Green Dragon in Bishopsgate gate street . Q . Has not he been thought for some time past to be out of his senses ? Fraser . Yes , he has , he has been at my house till 12 o'clock at night , and I could not ge t him out , and he would ramble into a parcel of nonsense . He has wandered up and down , and the watchmen have taken him to be a sort of a thief . Q . Did you at any time when he came to your house , take him to be out of his senses ? Fraser . He has gone backward and forward with his words , that there was no notice to be taken of him . Q . If you had thought him disordered in his senses at that time he brought these cloths to your house , would you have advised these gentlemen to have bought them ? Fraser . No . But at that time he spoke very well . And if I had thought they had been stolen , I would not have advised them to have bought them . Mr. Lamb . I was sent for by Mr. Fraser , and he told me the prisoner was a brother-in-law of his , and had got 4 pieces of cloth to sell . The prisoner said the maker was dead in the country ; and that they were sent up to be sold , because they wanted money , and he was to sell them for half a crown a yard , for ready money [ exactly half the price they are laid at in the indictment ] I took a pattern to show to a friend who is a very large dealer in cloths , to know whether they were a bargain or not , which I found they were . When I came back , Mr. Foster was there ; I said , I was the first person spoke to about them : but Mr. Foster insisting upon part , he had two , and I two . I sold my two pieces in a day or two , for six pence a yard profit . Tho Whaley . I keep the Bell Inn in Woodstreet . I ordered my chamberlain to go to the Three Cups in Bread street , for a truss that was directed by Mr. Bragg , the maker of these cloths , to be left there till called for . And the cloths were brought to my house ; they were sent to one Mr. Jarvis , who is agent for Mr. Bragg , and puts up his goods there . The truss was missing , and I enquired after it ; my chamberlain told me the prisoner had taken it away : said I , what business has he to take it away ? The prisoner was then absent ; but he returned again in about ten days time . Said I , George , let me speak to you ; what have you done with the little truss of cloth that was here ? said he , the right owner came for it , and I have given it to the right owner . He said , the man that brought it , ordered him to carry it away ; and he met with a carter who took it quite away . Said I , sure it must be carried to some inn : he said , he could not tell where it was carried to . Q . How long has he done business at your house ? Whaley . He has been a porter at my house about three years . He was porter to most of the ironmongers . When he came before the Justice , he said that he took the truss to Temple Bar , and then went to Monmouth street to sell it : that he disposed of it there , and had half a crown for his labour . Q . Is not he apt to be disordered in his senses , and he absent from his business sometimes ? Whaley . I believe he would get now and then drunk with gin ; and then he would absent him self two or three days , and say he was ill , and had got the cholick and gripes . Samuel Richards . On the 27th of February the prisoner at the bar came up into the gallery at the Bell Inn in Woodstreet ; went into one of the rooms in the gallery , and took out a truss of cloth . Q . Is the gallery any ways locked up with the house ? Richards . No , it is quite open to the yard . Q . Where was this cloth lodged ? Richards . It was lodged in one of the rooms in the gallery , which has been a lodging room . He said , Mr. Richards , I should be obliged to you if you would help me up with this cloth . I asked him where he was going to take it ; he told me he was taking it to the right owner 's in the Strand . I helped it upon his knott , and saw him take it down stairs , and carry it down the yard . Q . What sort of a truss was it ? how much do you think it weighed ? Richards . It might be about an hundred weight . Q . Do you know what was in it ? Richards . I never saw the inside of the wrapper ; but he told me it was cloth . John Harrison . I bought two pieces of cloth of Mr. Lamb . They were a couple of crested plains , the same kind of these ; but I have cut them up . Mary Brook , And please you , my lord , I am come to speak in my neighbour 's behalf . The prisoner at the bar at times is not in his senses , he has been forced to be confined in his bed , and sometimes he has been absent from his family for a week or fortnight together . - Patrick . I have known the prisoner a great many years ; and as to his lunacy , he has been so six or seven years . Sometimes I was afraid he would go out of his senses . I think it was occasioned by the fire at the White Swan , at Holborn bridge . Some goods were lost there , which was the occasion of his brains being turned . Jury , to Mr. Fraser . You say you have seen him to be disordered in his senses sometimes ? Fraser . He has been so in my sister 's time , and has not gone home for a whole eight days . Q . What was your opinion as to the condition he was in when he was at your house with the cloths ? Fraser . I did not look in his face , but he spoke very well . Jury . Mr. Lamb , how was he when you bought the goods of him ? Lamb . I do n't think he appeared any ways delirious ; he was as well as he is now . Jury . Mr. Whaley , how is he in general ? Whaley . Pretty well . Jury . Is he delirious sometimes ? Whaley . I never saw any thing of it .

Thomas Fox . I lay at Mr. Whaley 's at the Bell Inn in Woodstreet , when I am in town ( I live at Woolverhampton , and have a warehouse at Mr. Whaley 's ) When I went out of town I left a trunk with my clothes in it in my room . I got a search warrant , and found part of my clothes at Mr. Smith 's , a salesman in Monmouth street . There was a cloth coat , a cloth waistcoat , a velvet waistcoat , and two shirts . These are the clothes , the remainder of the things Mr. Smith had sold ; but he could not tell who he had sold them to , for he had sold them to different people , who came to his shop . Mr. Smith had taken the ruffles off these two shirts , because he intended them for his own use . Q . Do you know any thing of the prisoner ? Fox . He had been porter to me about two or three years , at the Bell inn . And about a fortnight before this , I had turned him off . Jury . Did you doubt his honesty when you turned him away ? Fox . No ; but he was given to drinking , so that he would be absent for three or four days together , and would get so drunk that they would turn him out of gin shops at three or four in the morning . He confessed before Justice Poulson , that he sold the clothes , and was employed by a person unknown to sell them . That he was employed to carry them into Holborn , and the next day to carry them into Monmouth street to sell them . When he was before the Justice , there was a paper of accounts , and a pair of knee-buckles found upon him , which I could swear were in the trunk . John Elton . I am servant to Mr. Thomas Fox ; he is an ironmonger ; I look after his business in town , and have a room at the Bell , in Woodstreet . I went into the lodging room at eight o'clock at night , to see if every thing was safe . Q . Did you mind whether his trunk was safe ? Elton . It was safe . Q . Did you lock the door ? Elton . I turned the key , but I ca n't pretend to say the door was locked . When I came up stairs between nine and ten in order to go to bed , I found the door unlockt , which surprised me very much . I asked the chamberlain if any body had been there , he said no body at all ; I told him Mr. Fox 's room , ( the room which I was in possessession of , ) was broke open . The prisoner gave such a slender account of the cloths which he had sold before , that I suspected him ; I went on Wednesday night to take him , but could not ; and on Thursday about six o'clock in the morning , I took him in bed , he broke from us in Chiswell street , and we took him again , and carried him before Justice Poulson . There was found upon him this pair of steel knee-buckles , which I believe are Mr. Fox 's , and this paper of accounts , which is my hand writing . Fox . These are my knee-buckles , this is my paper , which was in the box , and his receipt is upon it which he gave me , when I paid him off . Q . Do you know whether the prisoner had been about the house that night ? Elton . I saw him at six o'clock in the evening , I did not see him afterwards . Mr. Smith . On Wednesday the 13th or 14th of March , the prisoner brought some wearing apparel into my shop ; and said , he had got some to sell : they were in a box tied round with a rope , I took them out of the box , and asked him how he came by them ; he said , they belonged to a young gentleman that was dead , and the old gentleman the father was willing to sell them , and desired him to take them away , for they made him cry when he saw them : he said , he had been three weeks selling cloths and shalloons for the old gentleman , and these were the last of the things ; upon which I bought them and paid him for them ? Q . What did you pay him for them ? Smith . I paid him 4 l. 8 s. I believe I paid him 4 l. 12 s. but I am positive to 4 l. 8 s. Q . Are you sure the prisoner 's the person you bought them of ? Smith . I am sure the prisoner is the man . Prisoner . I met a tallish man with them upon his shoulder , and he asked me what I must have to carry them into Holborn ; and he gave me a shilling to carry them to the Crooked Fish in Holborn ; he bid me come again , and then he ordered me to sell them for what I could get .

I can only speak to the things that were found upon the prisoner ; these 14 napkins , 5 knives , 6 forks , 8 pewter plates , a China bason , and a decanter . I have been losing things these two years , but never knew who took them , till I found these upon the prisoner . I missed 7 dozen of napkins within in a year and nine months , besides a great number of knives , forks , & c. Philip Shirley . I was present when a dozen of these napkins were taken out of a box , in the prisoner 's room at the Globe ale-house . I found several towels , which were sewed together , to make aprons , 5 knives , and 6 forks . I found 6 bushels of coals under her bed ; I have lost a great many coals . Q . What made you suspect her ? Shirley . I had an information of it by a child . Elizabeth Wood . I am apprentice to the prisoner , and have been about a year and an half - I am turned of fourteen . I found a great piece of iron in the street , and carried it to my mistress ; and with this iron she broke open the door , where Mr. Shirley 's coals lay . Q . What time did she break it open ? Wood . About twelve o'clock at noon . Q . How long after you came to be an apprentice was this done ? Wood . A good while after , but I do n't know how long . Q .

About eight o'clock at night , I heard a hurly burly and came out ; the prisoner had a bundle in her lap , and hearing the prosecutrix say , she had got her bundle ; I asked the prisoner whether those things belonged to the person who said she had lost them , and she said no .

Q . Did you go to drink with the prisoner ? Turner . Never . Q . Did you ever see her before ? Turner . I never saw her in my life , before that night . Jury .

Q . How could you see these prisoners so well at 9 o'clock at night , when you say you had a swimming in your head ? Harrison . I am often troubled with that . Q . Do you see as well at that time as you do at other times ? Harrison . Yes , I thank God , I do . About two or three nights afterwards I saw Margaret Kirby with my hat and cloak on . I looked at her , and she said , you b - h , what do you look at ? I knew my cloak very well ; I was sure it was my cloak she had on . Mary Whaley . On the 25th of February , Margaret Kirby , Singing Jenny , ( I do n't know her other name ) Catharine Bowyer , Samuel Cobb , and I , went all out together with a design to knock down any man or woman that we met , or to pick any man up , or to do any thing that we could . Samuel Cobb went to this woman [ the prosecutrix ] as she was sitting down , and went to put his hand down her bosom , and she said , honest man , I am not the person you take me to be . Cobb took her cloak off and run away , and we all run after him up Prince 's street . We turned about again , knocked her down , gave her a slap on the face , and cut her head , tho ' I did not see the cut , and took her hat and cap , then we run to Peg Kirby 's mother 's . We thought they were but trifles to pawn or sell , so we gave the cloak , hat , and cap , to Peg Kirby 's mother ; and I had the ribbon . We went out again the next night with the same intent ; but did not do any more since that . The cloak is to be produced , but I do n't know any thing of the hat and cap . This is the cloak I am sure , Mrs. Harrison had not much about her , but it was all God have mercy to us . Susanna Caton . I was coming along with Elizabeth Peyton , about a quarter of an hour after nine o'clock at night , and the prosecutrix sat under a lamp at a gate ; we asked her what was the matter with her ; she said she had got a little swimming in her head ; we offered to see her home , she said it was no matter , she should be better presently ; and then came up Mary Whaley , and a fellow I did not know ( there were several more women near them . ) The fellow put his hand down the woman 's breast , and began to blast her eyes , and d - n her ; and Peyton said to me , I dare say this man is going to rob the woman , and he took away her cloak , who he gave it to I ca n't tell . Then they came back and took her hat and cap , and she desired us to see her to Red Cross street , for her head bled very much ; who did it , that I ca n't tell . Elizabeth Peyton . As I was coming down Barbican the 24th of February , on a Sabbath day , a little turned of 9 o'clock , I saw a woman sitting upon a step next door to a Stationers : I asked her what she sat there for ; she said she had been at Cripplegate lecture , and was not very well : I bid her not sit there , for there were many troublesom people about . I saw 3 or 4 women , and a man together . Moll Whaley and the man came up to her , and the man put his hand into the prosecutrix 's bosom ; and I said , do n't meddle with the woman , for she is not well ; he smiled at me , and then he began to search her gown ; I said to Susanna Caton , let us go , for I am sure he will rob the woman before he leaves her ; and he took her cloak off , and gave it to Moll Whaley ; who she gave it to afterwards , I ca n't tell , and they all run up Prince 's street by the Crown and Cushion : the prosecutrix run after them , and cried out stop thieves , and they said , blast your eyes , or d - n your eyes , do you follow us ? The fellow knocked her down , and the prisoners came up and took her hat and cap off , and she desired Caton and I to lead her to the Red Cross door . The prosecutrix came afterwards to our house , and desired us to speak the truth of what we saw , or I never would have come after them . Q . Was you acquainted with these women before ? Peyton . Never , only as seeing them in the street , or seeing them in a house . Q . Did you know their persons before ? Peyton . I knew all the women by sight . Dorothy Hollman . I happened to be coming out of my own court on a Sunday night about 9 o'clock , and heard swearing and sad wicked oaths , vast blasphemous oaths , and there was a riot , which made me afraid . I stepped to the chandler 's shop for a candle , and saw a man take the cloak off the prosecutrix 's shoulders , and then they all run away . I went with the candle to see the woman , her hair was over her eyes , and her head very bloody ; and then I went back to my own room . I do n't know any thing of the three prisoners , but this Mary Whaley lodged in the house where I do . - a pawnbroker . A young woman , who came from Margaret Kirby 's mother , brought this cloak to me , and pawned it for a groat . An honest woman brought it to me . Prisoner Mears , [ otherwise Kirby ] I had been ill for three or four months , and went out that Sunday , but was so ill that I was forced to go to a house and lie down , and coming along , I met Mary Whaley , and I saw the prosecutrix sitting upon a step , though I do n't know that I ever saw her till I saw her before the Justice , but I know nothing of the robbery . Mary Whaley was put into prison for thieving , and then the thieftakers prevailed upon her to turn evidence against us . Whaley . Margaret kirby and I went out a week before , every night together . - Rawlins . I have known Jane Smerk 16 or 17 years . Q . Do you know her by the name of Singing Jenny ? Rawlins . I do n't know her by that name , but I know her to be a true and honest girl . I never heard any thing amiss of her in my life . Smerk . I never went by that name , only as Whaley has had me set down so . Thomas Murray . Jane Smerk was my servant for some time , and during the time she served me , I never heard any thing of her dishonesty . - I have not seen her for above three years before now . Ann Ashmore . I have known Jane Smerk seven years ; I knew her in her husband 's days ; and after his death , she went to service , and always behaved honestly , for any thing that I ever heard . John Slevin . I have known her ever since she was a baby . I knew her father and mother , and I know that she was brought up in the fear of God . She married an engine weaver , and had three or four children ; and after his death she went to service . As to these people who appear against her , they are ballad singers , and vile persons . [ Peyton and Caton ] one is called Bet , and the other Suck : but as to their surnames , I never heard them . They took me into a house , I belive it was an unlawful house , and that scenes of iniquity have been acted there . I believe they would not stick to swear any thing . William Sims . Jenny Smerk worked with me as a servant by the week within this 12 month . I have goods worth forty or fifty pounds in my house at any time , which she might have taken ; and I never had any mistrust of her . Mary Perrin . I have known Margaret Kirby 5 years , she was always very honest ; she lived with me as a servant when I took in washing . Those witnesses [ Caton and Peyton ] who were against her , gave her a very bad character ; but they have very bad characters ; they make riots in the night , and let men in in the night . I never was before a Justice in my life , and do n't know how to speak . [ This witness swears that the witnesses had given the prisoner a very bad character , though she was not in court when they gave their evidence . ] Joseph Stokes . I have known Kirby and Smerk about five years , I know one as well as the other , and I can not alledge any thing amiss of them . Q . Do you know any thing of their lives and conversations , or where they have lived these four or five years past ? Stokes . I ca n't tell that . They were all three acquitted of the robbery , and found guilty of the felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 230 . + Edmund Gilbert , of the Hamlet of Bethnal Green , in the County of Middlesex , was indicted for feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , assaulting Thomas Salter , and with a certain wooden stick , of the value of one penny , which he had , and held in his right hand , giving him several mortal bruises on the head , back , belly and sides , on the 20th day of February last , of which he languished from the said 20th day of February , to the 24th day of the said month , and then of the said mortal bruises died , and therefore , that he , the said Edmund Gilbert , the said Thomas Salter , feloniously , wilfully , and of his malice aforethought , did kill and murder . He was a second time charged on the coroner 's inquisition , for feloniously slaying the said Thomas Salter . Richard Cole . I am apprentice to Edmund Gilbert ; the prisoner has beat the deceased with sticks and ropes . Q . Do you know any thing of his striking him at any particular time ? Cole . Yes . Q . What did he strike him with ? Cole . He hit him either with his fist , or else with a hearth brush , I ca n't tell which . Q . What was the deceased ? Cole . He was apprentice to Mr. Gilbert . Q . When was this done ? Cole . It was done on a Wednesday night , the Wednesday before he died . Q . How long is it ago ? Cole . I believe it is about 9 weeks . Q . Where did he hit him ? Cole . He hit him on the side , and on the forehead , and there was a great black place on his side . Q . What age was the boy ? Cole . About fifteen . Q . What business is Gilbert ? Cole . He is a draught weaver . Q . What was the occasion of his hitting him in this manner ? Cole . Because he did not do his work well . He did not hold up his lash and missed potlaths . I believe he was not well before , because he had not done his work : and the next morning he came down to do his work , and he could not stand , and my master sent him up to bed again , and he died on the Sunday morning between three and four o ' clock . - There was a mark on his side . Q . When did you see the mark ? Cole . I saw it after he was dead . Q . Did he complain of it ? Cole . His tongue was so swelled that he could not speak . Q . What was the illness he complained of ? Cole . He was not ill before . Q . You said he was ill before ? Cole . I thought he was ill , because he had not strength to hold up a lash . Q . What time was this blow given ? Cole . At ten o'clock at night . Q . Did he go to bed presently after he received this blow ? Cole . He went up to bed immediately after ; he was going up before . Q . When did you see him again ? Cole . I did not see him till the next morning . Q . Did he complain he was hurt ? Cole . He said nothing to me . [ There were three whips produced , one was a platted thong , and the other two had eight or nine single cords in each , with three or four knots in each lash ; the sticks and the lashes were each about sixteen inches long . ] Q . Did the prisoner use to whip him with these ? Cole . Yes . Q . Did he whip him naked or his clothes on ? Cole . He never whipped him naked that I saw , that night he whipped him with this [ one of the three whips . ] Q . Did you see him whipped ? Cole . I heard the noise of the blows . Q . Was you ever whipped with any of these ? Cole . With the breaded one , I was once . Q . Was your clothes on , or was you naked ? Cole . I had my clothes on . John Elks . I worked with the prisoner as a journeyman , and the deceased worked under me , as a draw boy . He had an inward weakness , one day he would do a pretty good day 's work , and sometimes he would not do any thing : he could do so little , that I could not maintain my self with him , and I was forced to turn him away . Q . Did you ever see the prisoner strike the deceased ? Elks . I have seen him strike him with a whip now and then , but not any thing to hurt him . I did not see any thing of this blow that the boy speaks of , either with his fist , or with the brush . Q . What was the reason he did not do his work ? Elks . He was either lazy , slothful or weak ; I I could not get my bread with him , and I told him I must have another drawer . Elizabeth Salter . About eleven weeks befor e the deceased died he came to see us : and said , Oh uncle ! I am killed , I am killed , I am murdered ; I said to him , I never heard a dead body speak ; and he said aunt , I am perished and starved and beat to death . I gave him some beer and he drank it , and his ordure came from him he was so weak . There were marks in his face of the prisoner 's thumbs and fingers , that he had pinched his jaw with ; there was a blackness under the jaw . I stripped him , and lookt at his body , he had some blood started out of his shoulder , and he had eight or nine marks of violence about his side , and back , and was bruised in a violent manner : his left side was turned yellow and green . Q . What did the blow seem to be given with ? Salter . They were bruises and violent blows , they were not given with a rod or whip . Henry Salter . About eleven or twelve weeks before the deceased died he came to my house ; I thought he might be run away from his master , and he said , Oh uncle , I am dead , I am killed , I am murdered ; my wife said , I never heard a dead person speak ; he said , his master had beat and abused him , and starved him , so that he could not live ; he drank part of a pint of beer ; I asked him to eat some cold beef , but he could not eat any ; he drank a second draught , and as soon as he had drank it , his ordure came from him : as he complained so of being beat , my wife stripped him , and looked at his body ; he was very much bruised , and his left side was turned yellow , and about his lower rib on the right side it was as black as my hat , and in some places yellow . I went to the prisoner 's house with the boy , and his wife opened the door ; the boy was afraid to go in : I said to the boy , do n't be afraid to come in , and she said , what is this the rogue your uncle , you called so many names . I went up to the prisoner , and told him how he had abused him , and he said , he had never beat him , but with such a thing as that , and shewed me one of these ; and said he never did him any more hurt ; I said , that could never make those bruises about him ; I said , Mr. Gilbert , I hope he will prove a good boy : so I came away and never saw him after till he was dead . Q . When was this ? Salter . This was the latter end of November last . Q . Do you know when he died ? Salter . No otherwise than as I was told ; they said he died on a Sunday , about eleven or twelve weeks after this . He had been dead seven or eight days before I saw him , and I do n't suppose I should have known any thing of it , if he had known where to bury him . Elizabeth Hackett . I live at Newington-Butts , I am the deceased 's Godmother ; his father and mother died within a fortnight of one another , and he was taken into Newington workhouse , and was put out apprentice from thence . The prisoner beat him and abused him sadly , and bruised him from head to foot . Q . When did you see the deceased ? Hackett . About ten weeks ago , I think it was in Christmas holidays that he was with me , he complained of being beat and abused . I went to Gilbert 's , to ask him the reason why he used him so , and he called me old b - h , and threatened me , if ever I came there again . Q . In what manner was he abused ? Hackett . He was bruised sadly upon his ribs , and his jaws were torn almost asunder , and the sides of his jaws were as black as ink . Q . What age was he ? Hackett . If he had lived , he would have been fifteen years old to-morrow . Jane Tinsell . I live in a room underneath Gilbert 's . About eleven or twelve weeks before the boy died , I heard Gilbert beating him most unaccountably on a Sunday in sermon time ; I said for the Lord 's sake , do n't beat him so ; and the boy said , do n't beat me so , if you do you will kill me , and he said , d - n you , you dog , I will kill you ; and he said , if beating would have killed him , he should have killed him before now , and it was a pity he had not killed him . The boy had a sore leg , and he beat him upon his legs ; the boy cried out to him , not to beat him upon his legs , and he said he would , and the more the boy cried out , the more he beat him . Q . Have you any thing more to say ? Tinsell . I have heard him beating him since two or three times in a day , and on the Wednesday before Salter died he beat him . Q . Did you see him beat him ? Tinsell . No , I never saw him beat him ; I only heard him . Q . Then how are you sure it was the boy that was beat . Tinsell . I knew him by his voice and his crying , and by that I could swear to him . Q . In what manner did he cry ? Tinsell . He cried pretty loud , and I heard the prisoner tumbling and beating him about . Prisoner to Cole . Did not I beat you more than I did the other ? Cole . Yes , more sometimes . Q . Have you been cruelly used by the prisoner ? Cole . Yes , I have been beat till my back was all bloody , only for over shooting a drop Lee , which is of no signification at all . Sarah Brown . I live over against the prisoner 's , he has beat his apprentices two or three times in a day ; the Wednesday before the deceased died , he beat him in a violent manner . Q . How do you know that it was Salter that was beat ? Brown . Because Cole . said , it was not him that was beat . Q . Did you know his voice ? Brown . Yes , I knew his voice from the others ? Q . When did he die ? Brown . He died on the Sunday morning . Q . Did you see him after he was dead ? Brown . I saw him on the Monday morning , dead in his coffin . Q . Was his body bruised ? Brown . Yes , it was bruised in a barbarous manner from head to foot ; there was a bruise on his right side , under his breast , as big as the palm or my hand ; and his arms down to his fingers ends , were bruised all to a mummy . There were two great holes in his right leg , supposed to come by kicks . Q . Did you see any marks about his face ? Brown . The lower part of it was black ; but they said , that was occasioned by the swelling of his tongue ; in closing his mouth to get his tongue in . Ann Landey . I am one of the searchers . The prisoner desired me to search the body of the deceased , and upon searching the body , I found it was bruised very barbarously ; there was not a free place about him . Q . In what manner did he appear to be bruised ? Landey . In a very barbarous manner . Both his hips , and one of his knees were bruised . There were about a dozen places that were very black . I turned him all round , and he was bruised from head to foot . The prisoner wanted me to give him a note to bury the body , and I told him I would not ; for the thing should be looked into . Elizabeth Bettule . I am one of the searchers , I examined the body , and there was a great bruise on the right side , and bruises on the left side , and on his arms , which is uncommon to see in a dead corps . I asked Mrs Gilbert the reason of it , and she told me he tumbled over the bed post . Mary Paine . I live next door to the prisoner . I have heard blows and cries almost for ever . Q . Who was it that cried out ? Paine . It was Salter . Q . How long was that before he died ? Paine . Three or four weeks , I ca n't say justly how long . I have often quarrelled with the prisoner 's wife about it , ( for she would beat him too ) and asked her how she could use the poor boy so ; and she said , I had no business to trouble my head with it , for the more I spoke , the more she would beat him . I have seen Mr. Gilbert knock him about the yard . His body was bruised on both sides , and one of his legs was quite mortified . Q . Had not he a sore about him ? Paine . I never knew that he had . Mary Goodine . I live next door but one to the prisoner ; I have heard Salter vastly beat and abused . Q . Who was he beat by ? Goodine . He was beat by his master . And there were such outcries , shrieks , and lamentations , that made our hearts bleed to hear them . Q . Was that occasioned by any blows that he received from the prisoner ? Goodine . Yes , and I have heard the blows in our yard , and I often used to have words with Mrs. Gilbert about it , and she used to make complaints of the boy 's fouling himself . [ One of the witnesses said , that in the cold frosty weather , Mrs. Gilbert made the deceased go out into the yard , and break the ice , and wash his own shirt that he had souled . ] Thomas Day . I was desired by the surgeon of Bethnal Green Hamlet , to assist him in opening the body of the deceased , upon a supposition that his death was occasioned by the cruelty and severity of his master : and upon taking a view of the body , I observed several bruises upon the trunk and limbs , and one upon his face . There was a very large bruise on his right side under his lower rib . Q . How do you apprehend that might come ? Day . I apprehend by a blow . Seeing this very large bruise , we judged it advisable to have the body opened , we opened the body five days after his death , and upon examination , I found the internal viscera found ; only there were two very large adhesions , one of the lungs to the pleura , and the other of the liver to the diaphragma . Upon farther search it did appear by other symptoms that the boy had an inflammation in the throat , which I apprehend brought on convulsions , and put an end to his life ; for his fingers were all contracted , and his nails were black : his lower jaw was locked up , and the lower maxillary glands were larger than common ; and that was the antecedent cause of this inflammation in his throat . Whether this came merely and absolutely from that cause without some other cause , or whether it was attended with other circumstances , is doubtful . But my humble opinion is , that this violent inflammation brought on a symptomatic fever , and this got the ascendancy over him , and occasioned his death . Violent blows do always occasion symptomatic fevers , and these fevers do occasion inflammations . And the boy suffered a great deal by cold , for it was a most severe season , and there was a succession of illness from the time of beating to the time of his death . Q . Then you think there was a symptomatic fever occasioned by the blows , and that occasioned the inflammation in his throat ? Day . I say , that , together with the cold the boy endured , might occasion it . But in my humble opinion , the case is something doubtful , whether it was the cold absolutely , or the symptomatic fever which concurred with it , that occasioned this inflammation ; for this examination of the body was five days after his death , and a corps may alter very much in that time . Q . What was the immediate cause of his death ? Day . The convulsions were , and they were occasioned by the inflammation ; but whether the inflammation came absolutely from the cold , or from the symptomatic fever , I can not positively say . There was the adhesion of the lungs to the pleura ; which proceeded from some other inflammation , and the adhesion of the liver to the diaphragma , and that might be occasioned by some former inflammation , that had seized this person , and terminated that way . Q . Might this inflammation proceed from violent blows ? Day . It might proceed from them . Q . Do you think this boy 's death was occasioned by the blows he received from his master ? Day . The boy was a poor emaciated creature , and not fit to be used as he was , if he had been a person of an athletic body , he might have bore this . I will always make a difference in subjects ; but he was a poor emaciated subject , and was not able to bear it . I never saw him when he was living . James Cobb . I received an order from an officer of Bethnal Green Hamlet , to view the body of Salter , on account of its being supposed that he died by the severe usage of his master . There were several bruises on the trunk of the body , and the limbs : there were some bruises upon his face , and there was a bruise under the lower rib on the right side . I wanted to know how far the bruises had affected the internal viscera , and upon opening the body , I found the internal viscera to be found ; but there were two adhesions , one of the right lobe of the lungs to the pleura , and the other of the liver to the diaphragma , which I apprehend proceeded from some former inflammation , and there was an inflammation in the throat , which might be the occasion of the boy 's death : but it is a difficulty with me to determine whether this inflammation proceeded from the fever only , or from the cold , or some other cause , or concurring causes ; such as frequent violent beatings ; and I do think they might occasion the symptomatic fever ; and that with the coldness of the season , might have produced such an inflammation that occasioned the boy 's death . And if proper remedies had been applied , I apprehend it would not have been attended with such consequences . The PRISONER 'S DEFENCE . Prisoner . There was a great stick lay upon the side of the loom , and that boy , Cole , struck the deceased several blows with it , and I took the stick away , and did beat him pretty well for it ; and I understand by my wife , that he beat him every day that I was out . His talk was to work but 9 hours a day , and there was not half his work done . I used to complain , and say , Tom , what are you at ? He was well enough on the wednesday morning before he died , and was taken ill at night . John Elks . I worked as a journeyman to the prisoner , the deceased worked with me , and on the wednesday before he died he had neglected his work , and I asked him in the evening why he did not work ; he said , he could not stand upon his legs ; and the prisoner said , if he could not stand upon his legs , I must get somebody else to draw . Q . Do you know any thing of Cole 's beating him ? Elks . Yes , many a time . Prisoner . He beat him ten times more than ever I did . Q . What did Cole lick him with ? Elks . With a stick , or any thing he could get . [ The prosecution was carried on at the expence of the parish , Justice Mussell of Bethnal Green being church-warden , Mr. John Woolveridge , overseer of the poor of the Hamlet of Bethnal green , attended as prosecutor ; and had leave granted him to ask the witnesses any questions he thought material . ] Woolveridge , to Elks . Who beat the deceased on the Wednesday night before he died ? Elks . His master did . Prisoner . Who beat him that night ? Elks . You did , and I lighted you . I would not tell my master what little work the boy had done that day , because he was a little in liquor ; and I told him how ill the boy was ; but however , he went up stairs , and hit him two or three blows with that one lashed whip ; but not blows that could hurt him I am sure . Q . How can you tell that ? Elks . Because I lighted him to do it . Woolveridge . I ask you whether , when the apprentice beat him , it was not by his master 's order ? Prisoner . I wonder you do n't swear it . Elks . Yes , I have heard him bid Cole beat him . Q . Did you never see Cole beat the deceased , but when his master bid him ? Elks . No , and I have heard my master say , when he went out in the morning , rib him . Cole . I have seen my master pinch him , and hit him such blows with the handle of a hammer on the head , enough to knock him down . He never let us go out ; and when he went out , he would lock us into the house . Q . What clothes had you ? Cole . We had only our old clothes in the house . which would hardly hang upon our backs . Q . What covering had you to the bed ? Cole . We had only our own clothes , and an old blanket upon the bed . Prisoner . Did you ever want victuals ? Cole . Yes , sometimes . Justice Ricards . When the prisoner was brought before me , there was no other witness to examine , than that boy who is his fellow apprentice . I examined him very carefully , and bid him not be afraid of his master , or any body ; and told him he should suffer nothing from any body . I asked him whether the prisoner beat the deceased with any unlawful weapon ; he said he beat him with a little stick . I asked him what was the reason of his beating him ; he said , because he would not work . I asked him again what he used to beat him with , and he said , only with a little stick , and that only when he would not work . I found he was very unwilling to discover any thing , and that he was in a terror . I would have persuaded him to have spoke more freely , but I could not . Prisoner . That honest man I suppose , has been tutoring my apprentice . Woolveridge . I saw the body on the Thursday and viewed it from head to foot , and it was such a spectacle , as I never saw in my life ; I gave orders for the coroner to be sent for , and he ordered the body to be opened . I got two surgeons , Mr. Day and Mr. Cobb , to open the body , and I desired Mr. Gilbert to get another surgeon for him , that nothing might be thought to be done in a clandestine manner , and he got a gentleman , who is in court . I carried the prisoner before Justice Ricards , and the boy was examined ; and in order for the security of the boy , that he might be forth-coming as a witness upon the trial , by the approbation of Justice Ricards , I took him home to my workhouse : I told the Justice that I would take care of him , that no body should say any thing to tutor the boy . And I have taken as much care of him as I could , to do justice on both sides . Samuel Wathen . I was sent for , on Friday the 1st of March , to be present with the two other surgeons , to examine the body of the apprentice , who it was supposed had lost his life by bad usage . There were several bruises on the outside of the body , but none of these bruises were the occasion of his death ; the principal bruise was on the lower part of the right side , under the lower rib . I examined the interior part of the body , and found all the viscera found , and in good order . There was an adhesion of the lungs , which I impute to some former inflammation : and I apprehend the boy 's death was not occasioned by the bruises on the skin , which was demonstrated not to extend farther than the flesh . Q . Do you think that any of the bruises were the occasion of the death of the boy ? Wathen . By no means , for they extended no farther than the skin , as I demonstrated to several on the coroner 's jury . Q . What do you take to be the occasion of his death ? Wathen . He had laboured under the disorder of a quincey , and all the glands were greatly swelled above the common size ; and in my opinion this quincey , and the inflammation which was occasioned by it , was the cause of his death . Woolveridge . I desire to know upon your oath , whether you did not say at the opening of the body , that the bruises the boy had received accelerated his death . Wathen . I believe the bruises and blows might have hastened his death , but the quincey was the occasion of his death . Q . Did you or did you not say these words , that these blows accelerated his death ? Wathen . I did say those words ; but I do not think that those blows had any effect upon the interior part of the body , so as to occasion his death . John Oake . I am a butcher ; I have served the prisoner with meat about a year and an half , and have commonly taken six or seven shillings a week of him , for beef , and he would very often buy prime pieces . Guilty Death . 231 . + Stephen Parsons , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a silver chocolate pot , value 7 l. 10 s. a pair of silver snuffers , value 15 s. a pair of silver tea-tongs , value 8 s. a silver stockbuckle , value 4 s. the goods of Sir Simeon Stuart , in his dwelling house , Octo . 10th . Sir Simeon Stuart . I have a dwelling house in York Buildings . I was in Suffolk when this accident happened . The prisoner had been a late servant of mine : I had notice sent me , that my house had been robbed , and that some of my pieces of plate were found at a pawnbroker 's . The plate was locked up by me when I went out of town in a strong box , and left in my dining room window ; the brass hinges were taken off , which was done by a person of judgment . I am very well satisfied these pieces of plate are my own . Elizabeth Warwick . I am servant to Sir Simeon , the prisoner lay in my master 's house , when he was out of town . Sir Simeon . That was after he was discharged out of my service ; I discharged him in Suffolk , without a livery , or any badge belonging to me . Warwick . I did not know that , for he came to the house , and said , he came to town upon business of his master 's , and I let him lye in the house about three nights . I can positively swear the box was very safe when he came into the house . Q . When did you miss the plate ? Warwick . Mr. Reason a silver-smith discovered it to me ; he came and asked me , if I had not lost something ; I looked in the dining room , and found two boxes broke open , and plate and wearing apparel gone . The prisoner went away in the morning ; and Mr. Reason sent to me about the chocolate pot , with Sir Simeon 's coat of arms , about five in the evening , and I found it there . William Reason . On the 10th of October last , about three o'clock in the afternoon , the prisoner came to me , put his hand in his pocket , and pulled out the lid of a chocolate pot : I asked him where the other part was ; he said , there was a coat of arms upon that , and he did not care to sell it . I thought there might be some weightier concern than that ; and he said , if I would buy this , he would return in two hours ; so I weighed it , bought it , and paid for it , and then he pulled out the snuffers and tea tongs . He not coming that evening , I directed my wife that if any person came with any plate , to secure him ; and the next day the prisoner brought the chocolate pot . I advertised it , and my brother-in-law , an engraver in arms , having the honour to work for Sir Simeon , he directed me to go to York Buildings , and there I saw Mrs. Warwick , and asked her if she was robbed ; she said she was not ; I said , I am sure Sir Simeon is , for I have some of his plate ; then she went to look , and missed it : she said , there was a raw boned young fellow , who had been servant to Sir Simeon , lay in the house ; and she was sorry , as she recommended him , that he should be the thief . The Prisoner is the person who brought the lid of the chocolate pot , the tea-tongs , and stock-buckle . Mary Reason . On the 11th of October the Prisoner brought this chocolate pot to me to sell . I put it into the scale , and weighed it , sent for assistance , and secured him . Prisoner . If you say this , you will say a thing that is wrong , for I am not the person that brought the things to your house . My master discharged me in the country , and I came to the housekeeper , and told her , my master had turned me away , and would not give me a character . She let me lie there two or three nights , but I know nothing of these things . I went to work in a rope-yard , and afterwards enlisted myself as a drummer in the first regiment of guards .

I lost the things above mentioned ; and in particular there were two rings that I put a great value upon ; one my mother was married in , and one I was married to this gentleman in [ the Prosecutor . ] I asked the prisoner concerning those rings , and she said , D - n my eyes , I will not confess any thing of the matter . Martha Smith . My master was going out to work in Salisbury-court , as a lighterman , between twelve and one at night , and my mistress went to see him a little way , because he was in liquor , and I went along with them . My mistress sent me back again , and told me she would return presently , but did not . When I came back , I saw the Prisoner , Lettice , at the door , and a man along with her , who I did not know . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Smith . I do n't know where she lives . I have seen her go two or three times down the yard , but I never had any thing to say to her .

You say you set out with your master and mistress , how came you to come back without them ? Smith . Because my mistress sent me back , and said she would be at home as soon as I . The next day my mistress sent her cousin for some money , and when my mistress 's cousin and I went into the house , the Prisoner was in one of the rooms lying upon the bed ; and she and the man told us , that no body should have any money , or any thing else , out of the house , without a note from under the hand of Matthew Wood . My mistress 's cousin opened the closet , and told the money over ; but they would not let her take any , so she went away without it . The Prisoner and the man went up stairs directly . When I came to the stairs head , I saw them at the closet door , with a piece of an iron bar . I run directly into the room , and said , For God 's sake , do n't rob my mistress . With that the Prisoner struck me , and the man knocked me down . She had a knife in her hand , and swore , if I came near her , she would rip me up with this knife [ the knife was produced , a common table-knife ] and when they had got the money and things out of the closet , they run away . Before my mistress 's cousin went out of the house I saw the man put up four gold rings , nine guineas , eleven shillings , and a pair of silver buckles , & c. into the closet . Q . When did you see the money ? Smith . When my master sent his cousin for the money ; I saw it about a quarter of an hour before I saw them at the closet , with an iron rod , attempting to break the door open . Prisoner . The last witness is a common woman of the town , and wants to swear my life away . Sarah Waters . My cousin Wood sent me to her house for some money ; when I went into the house , the prisoner was upon the bed ; and a man in the room : I went to the closet to get the money , and told it over twice , there were 9 guineas and an half , a moidore , a 36 s. piece , eleven shillings in silver , four gold rings , a pair of silver buckles , and a pair of silver studs ; she got off the bed and she and the man would not let me touch the money without a note under my cousin 's hand ; so I locked the money up again in the closet , and went back to my cousin . Q . Was Martha Smith by when you told the money ? Waters . She was with me , I put the money into the closet again , and locked it up . She went to acquaint my cousin , that the lock was broke open , and I met her as I was coming back . Prisoner . I have been ever since the 1st of August in the new goal in Southwark upon this account : I was committed by Justice Clark ; the prosecutor told me it signified nothing my being in the new goal , he said , That is not half satisfaction enough for I will hang you , for the sake of the reward , by the best neck you have . Matthew Wood stopped a man , and it cost his mother 10 l. to make it up , and his wife was indicted for receiving stolen goods . Thomas Price . Mary Wood * was charged not long ago with buying some soap that was stolen . I took twenty four pound of soap from Wood 's , and found the sirkin the soap was in , and took as many books there , as were worth 25 l. - Martha Smith has but a very indifferent character . * Mary Wood was committed to New Prison the 20th of December last , for receiving a sirkin with six pound of soap , knowing it to be stolen , and was discharged in January Sessions , at the goal delivery , for want of prosecution . Q . What do you say to Sarah Waters ? Price . I can say nothing to her . Pris . I was a lodger in Matthew Wood 's house , at this time , and had been there three nights . Mary Wood .

Q. to Waters . Do you know any thing of her being a lodger there ? Waters . I do not ; I never was in the house before . Q. to Smith . It is surprising you should see these people break open the house , and not apprehend them . Smith . They said they came with an order from my master and mistress to take care of the house . Q . You say you went to a neighbour 's house that night , did you tell them of these people being in Wood 's house ? Smith . They were in bed . Prisoner .

It was about thirty yards down the yard ; and I was at the end of the yard . William Bagshaw . On the 21st of August at night , I was coming from the Oliver 's Porter in Harrow alley , and heard a noise of murder cried ; some of the watchmen came towards me , I believe there were four or five of them ( I thought at first it had been a watch night ) and presently I heard a noise and murder cried .

Do you know the man that had his hanger drawn ? Bagshaw . No , they said his name was Burchall . Q . Should you know him again ? Bagshaw . I ca n't say that I should ; 't is some time since . Q .

They were also charged , on the coroner 's inquisition , for feloniously slaying the said William Worthington . Gilbert Metcalf . I live at the Ship in Barton-street , Westminster . William Smith [ the Son of John Smith ] and the Deceased were at my house , on the 1st of March , playing at skittles or nine-pins , and afterwards they came into the house , and played seven or eight games at cards . A dispute arising about a shilling , William Smith said that Worthington had taken it up , and the other charged Smith with it . Then they began to have high words ; and William Smith said he would have it out of his bones , or words to that purpose ; and challenged him to fight : Worthington would not , but got up and went into the skittle-ground , and I thought he had been going home . William Smith pushed by me , and run after him into the street . Q . Did you see them fighting ? Metcalf . I saw them pushing at one another . Q . Did you see William Smith strike the Deceased ? Metcalf . I saw him make several motions at him : he might strike him for what I know . Q . Did you see the Deceased making water ? Metcalf . Yes , and while he was doing it , William Smith fell upon him . Mr. Metcalf 's servant . William Smith and Worthington had been playing at cards , and there were eight games due to Smith , and he said , he would have the shilling : the other refused it him . William Smith said , if it was not for the law , he would knock his head off ; and Worthington said he would take no other law of him than what his hands gave him . Worthington went out of the house to make water , but before he had done it , William Smith followed him and struck him . They fought , and I took the Deceased up two falls , but the third fall I was not time enough ; and the old man [ John Smith ] said , You dog , what do you mean ? and William Smith hit me a slap on the face , and after Worthington had made water , they fell to it again . Q . How long had John Smith been there ? Witness . He was but just come in . James Frazier . William Smith and Worthington were playing at cards , and Smith said , D - n you , you have taken up the shilling . Worthington said , he had taken nothing but what was his right , and William Smith said , D - n you , if it was not for the law , I would knock your head off your shoulders ; and Worthington said , I wo n't take the law of you . Then the Deceased went out and put himself in a posture for making water , but I do n't believe he made any ; for at that time William Smith attacked him , and John Smith came in immediately , and bid his son strip . James Wright . I had taken the deceased up two falls , and I took him up the third , and he said he wanted to make water : Then William Smith pulled his clothes off ; and when the Deceased was making water , he fell upon him , and the Deceased had another fall afterwards , which was the last fall . John Smith said to the Deceased , D - n you , if you are a man , why do n't you fight ? Q . Did they seem to fight by agreement , or did the Deceased seem as if he would have gone away if he could ? Wright . They both consented to fight ? James Cooper . I was at Mr. Metcalf 's that evening at the conclusion of this affair . Q . Did you see them fighting ? Cooper . No , but I saw one of them fight . The Deceased was not able to fight , and the old man came and held the Deceased up for the young one to beat him , and said , What ! do you want to take breath ? and they fought again . After they had been fighting , the son endeavoured to strike the Deceased when he was down , and hardly able able to rise off the ground , but I prevented it . Prisoner 's Council . You say the old man held the Deceased up to be beat by William Smith ; was the Deceased 's back or his face towards him ? Cooper . His back was towards John Smith 's breast . There were several people by that saw it . Pris . Coun . You say there were several people there , and no body saw this but you : I suppose they were Englishmen ; and you say that they stood by , and saw him beat : was that like an Englishman ? Cooper . They would not see : but I saw that the Deceased was not able to fight ; and there were some people by , who , if they had had either honour or honesty , would have done as I did . Ann Cleaver . Hearing a great noise in the street , I went out and saw the Prisoner and the Deceased fighting . Mrs. Worthington desired me to part them . William Smith was hawling him down by the hair of his head . I said , Do n't pull him by the hair ( for he had a great head of hair ) you seem to be too many for him : And somebody who was behind William Smith backed him on to strike the Deceased ; and then they fell to fighting . I said to the Deceased , William , come along , do n't fight any more : and somebody behind William Smith said , If he wo n't fight , do you lick him . Thomas Astley . [ apothecary ] On the 2d of March last , about six in the morning , I was knocked up to go to the deceased ; I found him exceeding full of pain , and he could not make water ; he had all the symptons of a mortification upon him , and seemed in a dangerous way ; I asked him , where the seat of his complaint was , he said it was about his bladder , and believed it was occasioned by what happened the day before ; he said he was in company with one Smith , and they had some words , that he went out to make water , had got his penis in his hand , and was knocked down and pulled back ; that Smith obliged him to fight , and in the middle of their fighting he begged to make water , and it was refused him . This he told me , he was as honest a man , and as industrious a man , as any in his capacity . Q . Did you not probe the man ? Astley . I went for a surgeon , and I felt of the parts , and found there was no retention of urine , and the surgeon said , he had no great quantity of water in the bladder ; and the surgeon did endeavour to cause him to make water ; the next morning Mr. Presgrove introduced the Catheter , but there was no water came . Robert Heathfield surgeon . I was desired by Mr. Astley to pay a visit to Mr. Worthington , and I found he had a violent pain in the abdomen , which I took to be upon the neck of the bladder ; he ordered a somentation in order to relax the parts , and I think Mr. Presgrove was called , and he endeavoured to introduce the Catheter , but could bring away no water . Mr. Presgrove advised him to the warm bath , as he was going there he saw Mr. Cheselden , and he introduced the Catheter , and he brought a little water off his bladder , I believe about three or four ounces . I opened the body , and there was some water in the bladder , and something of an inflammation that extended itself near the bladder . I could not see any bruise on the parts , but in taking off the outward skin , I found there was a mortification on the upper part of the bladder , which I apprehend was occasioned by the retention of urine ; his having something of a desire to make water , and holding it so long as he did , must be the occasion of a violent inflammation of the parts , which occasioned the mortification , and I believe that was the occasion of his death . Q . Do you apprehend any of the blows he received in fighting , was the occasion of his death ? Heathfield . I do n't apprehend that any of them was the occasion of his death . I put my probe into his nose , and there was but a trifling wound ; and I found the bone of the nose fractured , which was a surprising thing to me , but I do n't think that was the occasion of his death . Q . What other bruises were there upon the body ? Heathfield . None that I saw . Q . Had he a retention of urine before ? Heathfield . I asked him that question , and he said he had not . John Smith Acquitted . William Smith , Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 241 . + John Sutton [ a black ] of St. James Clerkenwell , was indicted for that he , on the 2d day of March upon Mary Swain spinster , did make an assault , and her the said Mary , wickedly , unlawfully , and feloniously did ravish , and carnally know and abuse , against the form of the statute . Mary Swain . [ A mulatto ] first and foremost Mary Sutton [ the reputed wife of the prisoner ] came to our house , and asked for my mother ; I told her my father and mother were in bed - This is about seven or eight weeks ago . Then she desired me to come and sit with her till her husband came home ; I said I could not , for my father and mother would be angry ; but I did go and sit with her , and in about three quarters of an hour John [ the prisoner ] came home , and they gave me some goose . Q . Where does Sutton live ? Swain . He lives in our alley - Rose alley by Turnmill street ; then she asked him whether he would not give his countrywoman something to drink ; they had a pint of drink ( about 10 or 11 at night ) and made me drink the best part of their beer ; they desired me to stay a little longer and a little longer , and at last they shut the door and took the key out , and would not let me go home , and said , I should lie there all night ; I said it would not be proper for me to lie with a man and a woman ; says she , you have no occasion to be afraid , as I shall be in the room with you . I said , I did not chuse it , as I had a house of my own to go to : she said , I should lie behind her back . She kept me till between four and five in the morning , and I grew drowzy ; then she bid me go to bed ; the prisoner was in bed a good while before I went to bed : she took my gown and one of my petticoats off , and put me to bed with two petticoats and my stockings on ; and I went under the blanket that the prisoner lay upon ; as soon as I got under the blanket , he began to grow impudent . Q . What did he do to you ? Swain . He pulled up my two petticoats - I am ashamed to speak what he did to me ; but I would not take a false oath for the world ; I would not go to take his life away for a wrong thing . Q . Was the prisoner 's wife in the room all the time ? Swain . Yes , and she bid him be rude with me . I am not willing to take his life away . Q . What was it he did to you ? Swain . He put his impudence into me . [ The girl with a great deal of seeming unwillingness and reluctance expressed herself in such terms , as were sufficient to prove the fact . ] Q . Upon your oath was that done with your will or against your will ? Swain . It was done against my will . He struggled with me , and was too many for me . I cried out murder , and he said if I cried out , he would do me a mischief , and his wife bid him be rude with me ; and I begged and prayed of her to help me , and she would not do it . And afterwards she said , you b - h , I 'll tear your handkerchief off your neck , because you have lain with my husband , and then she beat me . Thomas Swain . [ the girl 's father ] My Lord , I am very willing the prisoner should be discharged ; she was a long time before she would tell me the circumstances of the thing . Q . You said you cried out murder , what persons were in the house besides them ? Swain . I do n't know the people that live in the house ; there is one Hitchcock has the room above the prisoner , and another person the room above him . Q . Was you let out at last ? Swain . Yes , and as soon as Betty Forbes cried out , they opened the door , and turned me out . Q . What time was this ? Swain . This was about 5 o'clock in the morning , my father looked out of the window , and cried Polly , and I said , they wanted to kill me , they would not let me come out , and when I came out my father beat me , because I went into the house . Q . Did you acquaint your friends with it ? Swain . I was going to tell my father of it , and he would not hear me , and he said , I deserved as much more for going into the house ; for they had a warrant for my father before . I went to sleep at 5 o'clock , and slept till between 12 and one ; and before that time Sutton had told all the people what he had done to me . Q . Did you discover it before Sutton did ? Swain . No , I did not , for I did not tell it before my father came home . Q . When was this done ? Mary Swain . It was done on the Saturday morning - I took him up the next Monday or Tuesday following . Thomas Swain . On the 1st of March , between 9 and 10 in the evening , my wife and I went to bed ; I slept till about four o'clock , and was sadly surprised with the cry of murder . I listened to the crying , and thought it was the voice of my own girl . I listened again , and presently I heard murder cried out again . I felt in the bed , and missed my girl , ( for I have but one bed , and she sometimes lies at the head , and sometimes at the feet . ) I listened , and there was murder cried again , and my wife said , for God 's sake , get up , it is Polly . I went to the window , and there was murder cried again ; and Betty Forbes called out , and said , You black dog , what are you doing with the girl , turn her out of doors , or I 'll make you , for upon the cry of murder we can break open the door . And I said to Betty Forbes , I believe it is my girl ; and then the prisoner 's wife opened the door and let her out ; and as there had been a quarrel between them before , I began to beat the girl , because I had bid her not to go there . She began to open her complaints , but I did not care to hear her , but beat her the more . She was very sleepy , and I believe about 5 o'clock she went to sleep , and I went out about 6 to get a place of work , and desired my wife to go to Black John and Mary , to know why they used the girl so , and kept her out . When I came back , I was surprised with the account of this story . Said I to my wife , this rogue , Black Jack , has debauched Polly . ( I did not believe he was such a villain , and though he has told me so frequently in publick , I did not believe it . ) Said I , you villain , how could you use my girl in this manner ? he said , she came to bed to me ; I said , how , and in what manner ? he said , she undressed herself , and came to bed to me . I said , if she came to bed to you , did she ask you to use her in this manner ? he said , she did not ; but he argued a point of law with me . and said , if any body was to come into my bed , and I was to lie with them , the law could not hurt me ; but afterwards he said , he would make it up at any rate . No , I said , I will not put this up for a pot of beer , or any such thing . Then he said he would marry the girl ; said I , how can you marry her when you have two or three wives already ? ( for he is not married to this Mary ) I would rather chuse she should be a whore all her life time , than be a wife to such a rogue as you , for then she will get something . Then he told me the reason why his wife beat the girl ; that it was because she caught her in bed with her husband ; but when he came before Justice Poulson , he said he was drunk , and did not know any thing of the matter . Elizabeth Vaughan . I know Black John very well , I have lived by him two years , and never heard or saw any ill of him in my life . Q . Did not you hear murder cried out ? Vaughan . I ca n't tell . I heard her cry out , and I heard her say in the room , do n't tell my mother , pray Mary ; and as she was coming out , Moll said , go you b - h , what have you been - with my husband for ? Q . Did you hear at that time that she had a rape committed upon her ? Vaughan . No , she said she had got a handkerchief from her . Thomas Swain . Ask her whether she did not hear the prisoner 's wife say in a braggadochio , I bid Jacky - her ; and Lambert declared she heard the girl cry out murder . Lambert . I was in bed , I never heard her cry out murder . Elizabeth Dandrews . I was sent for to search Mary Swain , to know whether she had been wronged , and her mother flew upon me , and would not let me . She sent for me afterwards , and I found she had been lain with ; but there were no marks of violence , for I handled her pretty roughly , and she did not cry out . The father of the girl was angry with me , because I would not come into his judgment . Thomas Swain . When this woman searched her , it was three or four days after the thing was done . Eleanor Nash . I know the prisoner to be a very honest man ; I have lived by him two years . I heard her say , she had more right to the prisoner than his wife , and she would have to do with him when she pleased . Q . When was this said ? Nash . This was the 2d day of March , between one and two on Saturday morning . Acquitted . 242.

James Stansbury , Boyers , Saunshus and I , broke open a linen draper 's shop in Houndsditch , and took two dozen of plates , six dishes , a thing with three stands to it ( I do not know the name of it ) a large silver spoon , and I believe two or three more spoons , and an old apron or two which we tied them up in - it was about the middle of Sept. and about two o'clock in the night . Q . What did you do with them ? Mecum . We sold them to Samuel Levi ( the prisoner ) he lived about two doors off this house that we broke open . I lived then in White Chapel , he came to me , and said , there is such a house broke open , and asked who did it ; he said , Sam , if you did it , you may as well let me have the things , as any body else ; I said I knew nothing of them ; he said , I might as well let him have them , for he knew the house was broke open ; for he came by the door , and the people who lost them thanked God they had lost no more . Q . What did you sell them for ? Mecum . We had twenty eight shillings for the whole , the next morning . Q . Did you tell him how you came by them ? Mecum . Yes , he knew how we came by them . Q . What business is the prisoner ? Mecum . He sells old clothes . Q . Did you ever sell this man any stolen goods before ? Mecum . Yes , several times , and he has dealt with an hundred thieves .

I know nothing of you . Mecum . There was a hanger taken out of the house at the same time , and they kept that several days : the thief-takers had the hanger afterwards . George Jackman . I am a hatter by trade . I live in Creed-church lane . I have known the Prisoner about six years : he buys and sells old clothes . My men were drinking at the Taylors arms in Duke 's place , and I went to call them . Mecum . That is a house which used to harbour all the thieves . Jackman . That is nothing to me , my character can be cleared . Q . When was that ? Jackman . I believe about last May or June . Mecum was rapping it out prodigiously , and swearing in a most vile manner , that if he met with the person he was swearing about ( who I did not know ) he would shoot him and chop him to pieces . Q . Who did that appear to be ? Jackman . The Prisoner at the bar ; and this was ( as I heard afterwards ) because the Prisoner had arrested his wife , or his supposed wife . I made answer , and said , Young man , I do n't know you ; but if this was a friend of mine , I would take care of you ; for you should not say such vile words as these . Mecum . How came you here for a witness ? Jackman . The Prisoner 's spouse came to me , and desired me to come . Mecum . You would perjure yourself to swear against me , when you know nothing at all of the matter . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before ? Jackman . He was servant to a gentleman I serve with hats , Mr. Levi in Lime-street . Jacob Jacobs . About twelve months ago I was drinking a pint of beer , and this Gentleman was just come out of Newgate . Mecum swore a great oath , and said , If I rob the whole world , I 'll be revenged on you , and bring you to the gallows ; and Mr. Jackman was angry with him for saying so , and was ready to beat him . I believe he had arrested his wife ; the officer that arrested her is in court . Henry Samuel . I have known the Prisoner ten or eleven years , and know him to be a man who works hard for his family . I have lent him two or three guineas at a time , to buy old clothes , and he has paid me very honestly . Elizabeth Lyon . The Prisoner was a lodger to me six years ago ; and three years ago his wife and he lodged with me . I know he always took a great deal of pains to get his living , by buying old clothes .
