And James Gregory , and William Merchant were indicted for aiding , assisting , and comforting the said Richard Savage in the aforesaid Murder . They were a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest ; to both which Indictments they pleaded Not guilty . The Witnesses were examined separately , in the Absence of each other , at the Request of the Prisoners . Mr. Nuttal thus depos 'd , On Monday the 20th of November , I , in Company with the Deceas 'd , Mr. Limery and his Brother , went to Robinson 's Coffee-house near Charing-Cross , about 11 at Night , where we staid till One or Two in the Morning ; we drank there two Bowls of Punch , which came to six Shillings , and were just concluding to go when the Prisoners came into the Room ; the first who came in was Mr . Merchant , who , setting his Back to the Fire , kick 'd down our Table without any Provocation , upon which , I said , What do you mean ? Mr. Gregory answered , What do you mean ? Upon which Mr. Savage drew his Sword , we retreated to the further End of the Room , I did not see the Deceas 'd draw his Sword , but Mr. Gregory drew , and I beg 'd of Mr. Savage and Mr. Gregory to put up their Swords , which they refus 'd , and Mr Gregory turning to the Deceas 'd , said , Villain deliver your Sword , and soon after took the Sword from the Deceas 'd ; Mr. Gregory 's Sword was broke in the Scuffle , but with the Deceased 's Sword in his Hand , and part of his own , he came and demanded mine , I refused , he made a Thrust at me , I defended it ; he endeavoured to get my Sword , but he fell , or I threw him , and took away the Sword from him ; three Soldiers came into the Room and secured him . I did not see Mr. Savage Push at the Deceased , though I heard the Deceas 'd say , I am a dead Man , soon after which the Candles were put out ; after this I went up to the Deceas 'd , I saw him in a Chair , with something hanging out of his Belly , which I did believe to be his Caul , or Fat . The Maid Servant of the House came in , and kneeled on her Knees to such the Wound ; after this the Soldiers came in , and I. and Mr. Gregory , were carried to the Watch-house : Being cross examined by Mr. Gregory , If he did not say , Put up your swords , he said , there might be such an Expression , but I can not call to Mind when it was spoke . Mr. Limery thus depos 'd , I was in Company with the Deceas 'd , Mr. Nuttal , and my Brother , at Robinson 's Coffee-house when this unhappy Accident happen 'd , we were ready to go home , when some Body knock 'd at the Door , and the Landlady opening it , let in the Prisoners , and lighted them into another Room , but they would not stay there , but rudely came into ours ; Mr . Merchant kicke 'd down the Table , Mr. Gregory came up to the Deceas 'd , and said , G - d d - n you , you Rascal , deliver your Sword ; ( all our Company retreated , ) I saw Swords drawn , and Mr. Savage made a Thrust at the Deceas 'd , who stoop 'd and cried oh ! at which Mr. Savage stood for some Time astonish 'd , and turn 'd pale , then endeavoured to get away ; I held him , and the Lights were then put out , we Struggled together , and the Maid came to my Assistance , and pulling off his Hat and Wig , clung about him , and striving to force himself from her he struck at her , and cut her over the Head with his Sword and got away ; I went to a Night Cellar and got 2 or 3 Soldiers , who took Mr. Savage and Mr . Merchant in a back Court . When Mr. Savage gave the Wound the Deceas 'd had his Sword drawn , but pointed downwards to the Ground on the Left Sides As to Mr . Merchant , I did not see he had a Sword . ( This was likewise confirmed by Mr. Nuttal , and that he did not see him in the Room after the Play began , the Candles being put out , he went into a back Court , in which he was taken with Mr . Savage . ) Jane Leader thus depos 'd , I was in the Room and saw Mr. Savage drawn first , then Mr. Gregory went up to the Deceas 'd , and Mr. Savage stabb 'd him , and turning back he look 'd pale ; then the Deceas 'd said , I am dead , I am dead , and would have gone out of the Room , but I opened his Coat and made the Servant Maid suck his Wound , but no Blood came . I , upon his Death-Bed , asked him to tell how he was wounded , he said , the least in Black gave the Wound , ( which was Mr. Savage , ) ( for Mr . Merchant was in coloured Cloaths , and had no Sword ) that the Tallest , ( which was Mr. Gregory , ) pass 'd or struck his Sword , whilst Mr. Savage Stabb 'd him : I did not see the Deceas'd 's Sword at all , nor did he open his Lips , or speak one Word to the Prisoners . Mrs. Endersby , who keeps Robinson 's Coffee-house , depos 'd , That finding the Prisoners in Liquour when she let them in , she Shew 'd then another Room , and they were rude to her , on which , she said , If they wanted to have any Liquour , they should have it , if not , she desired they would be gone , when one of them took up a Chair , and offer 'd to strike her with it ; she saw Mr. Savage Struggle with the Maid Servant , and cut her over the Head with his Sword , and that Swords were drawn and the Mischief done , ( as has been sworn by others ) and told the same Story of Mr . Merchant 's kicking down the Table , which , she said , was a Foulding Table with two Leaves , and that there were two other Tables in the Room , which is the publick Coffee Room in the Day-time ; whether they were sitting or standing at the Table , she could not be positive . Mary Rook , the Servant Maid depos 'd , That she , with her Mistress , let the Prisoners into the House , and that when her Mistress shew 'd them a Room , Mr . Merchant pull 'd her about very rudely , and she resisting him , he took up a Chair , and offer 'd to strike her with it , and asking who was in the next Room , this Deponent said , Company who had paid their Reckoning and were just going away , and desired them to have Patience till they were gone , but they would not , and then ran in ; and not long after this Deponent going in , saw Mr. Gregory and Mr. Savage with drawn Swords , and Mr Sinclair had his Sword in his Hand with the Point from him , and soon after Jane Leader said , Poor dear Sinclair is Kill 'd ; She suck 'd the Wound but it would not bleed , Mr. Savage endeavouring to get away , this Deponent stop 'd him , & c. But this Deponent did not see the Wound given , but was an Eye-witness after to the Encounter between Mr. Nuttal and Mr. Gregory . The Reverend Mr. Taylor depos 'd , That on the 21st of Nov. he was sent for to pray by the Deceas 'd , and after recommending him to the Mercy of Almighty God , Mr. Nuttal desired him to ask the Deceas 'd a few Questions , but Mr. Taylor not thinking it belong 'd to his Province , modestly refus 'd it : But Mr. Nuttal , willing to have an Evidence to the Words of a dying Man , persuaded Mr. Taylor to stay whilst he himself should ask him a Question , and turning to the Deceas 'd , Mr. Nuttal said , Do you know from which of the Gentlemen you received the Wound ? To which the Deceas 'd answered , From the shortest in Black , ( which was Mr. Savage ) the tallest commanded my sword , and the other stabb 'd me . Rowland Holderness depos 'd , That he was a Watchman that came to the Room just after the Wound was given , and then heard the Deceas 'd say , he was stabbed barbarously before his sword was drawn . Joseph Wilcox , another Watchman , depos 'd , That he saw the Deceas 'd learning his Head upon his Hand , and that then he said , he was a dead Man , and stabbed Cowardly . Mr. Wilkey the Surgeon depos 'd , That he searched the Wound , which was on the Left side of the Belly parallel with the Navel , that the Sword had grazed on the Kidney , and he did believe that Wound to be the Occasion of his Death . Being ask 'd , If he did believe the Deceas 'd could receive the Wound in a Posture of Defence ? he answer 'd , He did believe he could not , unless he was Left-handed . Mr. Gregory , in his Defence said , That the Reason of their coming into the Room was , for the Benefit of the Fire , and that the Table was thrown down by Accident : He then endeavoured to bring the Evidences for the King under the Imputations of Loose-lives , and People that had no Regard to Justice of Morality ; he likewise insinuated to the Court , That the House in which the Disorder was committed bore a very infamous Character . Mr. Savage , in his Defence , gave the Court an Account of his leaving his Lodgings at Richmond , and his being necessitated to spend the Night in a Manner not suitable to his Inclinations , he being disappointed of a Lodging in Town . After which , he made some Observations on the Depositions of Mr. Nuttal , Mr. Limery , and Mrs. Leader , in which he presum 'd , there were some Incoherencies ; and then proceeded to invalidate their Evidence , and to prove , that he , and the Gentlemen of his Company , were not of inhumane or barbarous Dispositions ; adding , that he should not have endeavoured to escape , but to avoid the Inclemencies of a Goal , and the Expences which must necessarily follow , which were too extravagant to be supported by a Person in his Circumstances . He then called Henry and Thomas Huggins , and Robert Fish , who had been Spectators at the Conclusion of the Broil , their Evidence confirmed Mr. Nuttal 's being engag 'd with Mr. Gregory , and Struggling for a Sword , and said , It was a House of ill Fame . Mary Stanly appeared in Behalf of the Prisoners , but the Extent of her Deposition amounted to no more , than that she had seen the Deceas 'd in a Quarrel , and that Mr. Nuttal and he were very well acquainted , and that she had seen Mr. Nuttal , and Mrs. Leader , in Bed together . John Pearce depos 'd , That Jane Leader told him , That when the Swords were drawn she went out of the Room , and did not see the Wound given ; and further said , That she was a Woman of very ill Reputation , and the Coffee-house had a bad Character . Daniel Boyle depos 'd , That the Deceas 'd had the Character of an idle Person , and had no Place of Residence . John Eaton said , he knew the Deceas 'd for two Months , and said , he had but an indifferent Character , but yet he confess 'd he knew nothing of his Character from other People . Mr. Rainby depos 'd , That going to Robinson 's Coffee-house to enquire for Mr . Merchant , he heard Mr. Nuttal say , the Morning after the Accident Happened , If he had any one of them in a Convenient Place , if he could escape the Law , he would cut their Throats . Mr. Cheeseborough depos 'd to the same Effect . Then Mr. Nuttal produced several Gentlemen , who depos 'd , That he was a Man of Reputation , as well as good Manners and Civility ; acknowledging at the same Time , that being moved by the barbarous Treatment his Friend had met with , he believed he said , That if he had them ( meaning the Prisoners at the Bar ) in an open Field , he would not put them to the Law , but would do Justice himself . There appeared in Behalf of the Prisoners , several Gentlemen and Persons of Honour , who gave each of them the Character of being peaceable and quiet in their Temper , and not given to Quarrel ; and the Prisoners hop 'd , that their good Character , and the Suddenness of this unfortunate Accident would intitle them to Favour . The Court Sum 'd up the Evidence , and took Notice where there were any Inconsistencies that might make for the Prisoners , and directed the Jury , That as the Deceas 'd and his Company were in Possession of that Part of the Room where the Fire was , that the Prisoners were the Aggressors , by kicking down the Table and drawing their Swords immediately upon it ; that if they did believe that the Deceas 'd retreated , was pursu 'd , attack 'd and kill 'd in the Manner as is sworn , and declared by the Deceas 'd on his Death-Bed , without the least Provocation on his Part , that it was Murder as well in him that gave the Wound , as in the others who aided and abetted in this Violence ; that the Jury had heard what had been objected to some of the Evidence , and what had been reply 'd on their Behalf , and as they did credit them , they were to give a Verdict accordingly : As to the Character of the Prisoner that should influence a Jury where the Proof is doubtful , but not to defeat plain and positive Evidence ; and for the suddenness of this Accident , where there is a sudden Quarrel , and a Provocation from one that is kill 'd , or where on a sudden Persons mutually attack each other and fight , and one is kill 'd in the heat of Blood , that is Manslaughter ; but where one is the Aggressor , pursues his Insult with his Sword , and kills the Person attack 'd without any Provocation on his Part , though on a sudden , the Law implies Malice , and this is Murder . As to Favour from the Character of the Prisoners , and having no premeditated Malice , that lies properly before the Fountain of Mercy . But the Jury are to proceed according to the Evidence and the Rules of Law : The Court indulg 'd the Prisoners , to remind them if any Thing that they thought material on their Behalf , and been unobserved in summing up so long an Evidence , and took Notice accordingly to the Jury of what they mention 'd . Upon the whole Matter , after a Hearing of about eight Hours , the Jury gave their Verdict , That Richard Savage , and James Gregory , were guilty of Murder , and that William Merchant was guilty of Manslaughter .

She endeavoured in her Defence to make the Prosecutor ridiculous , by a ludicrous Tale of their Familiarity at a Brandy-Shop ; but let his Crime be what it would , hers was too conspicuous to escape without Punishment , for the Jury found her guilty to the Value of 10 d.
