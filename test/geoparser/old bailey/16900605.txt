Upon which Goodman interposing to keep the Peace , Kelsey gave him the aforesaid wound with a Knife , which was produced in Court as a further Evidence against him . Although the Prisoner called some Evidence out of Newgate , endeavouring to extenuate the Crime , yet the proof being very positive against him , he was found guilty of wilful Murder . [ Death . See summary . ] Thomas Sheldon a Soldier , was Indicted for the Murther of one Richard Woodhead , on the 16th of May last , giving him a mortal wound on the right side of his Body with a Sword value 12 d of the breadth of one Inch and the depth of ten , of which he instantly died : It was sworn that the Prisoner and the deceased were Soldier s together in the Lord Sidney 's first Regiment of Guards and going together to receive their Pay , a quarrel arose he with them about some slight matter , and the deceased was seen to strike the Prisoner a blow over the head , upon which they drew their Swords , and in the Scuffle the said Woodhead was killed .

See summary . ] George Risbey was Arraigned for stealing a Silver Tankard value 7 l. on the 25th of May last , from William Clench . To which indictment he immediately pleaded guilty , & c.

The Evidence deposed , that the Prisoner was found in the Prosecutor 's shop about 11 of the clock at night , and some of the Shoes were found in his custody . The Prisoner denied the Fact , yet he was found guilty of the Felony . Taking hold of Their Majesties Pardon , the Prisoner was discharged . John Goodson as principal , and Abraham Hartslop as Accessary , were both tryed for the Murther of one Bartholomew Long on the 8th day of May last , giving him a mortal Bruise with a Quarter-Staff upon the head , of which he instantly died . The Evidence declared , that some rude Fellows viz White Fryers Men , were striving to get away some Goods out of the Prosecutor 's house in Cow-lane , the Tenant , viz . a Broker , designing to make his Escape deceitfully into the Mint : But the Landlord interposing , they made a great Mutiny , and Riotous Tumult , threatning to be the death of any who should oppose them , and had several Quarter-staves , and short wooden pocket pistols , ( as they term them ) which are to be used in Chambers , or narrow places , with other Instruments of Cruelty . Goodson , was seen to strike the deceased with an Ashen Quarter staff about five Foot long , of which he immediately died . But it did not appear that Hart-slope struck any Blow . The Surgeon said that the deceased died of the Bruise . Goodson offer 'd but little for himself , only that he was hired as a Porter to get away the Goods and called some Evidence , who gave a fair account of his former Conversation . But there being but one Evidence that swore positively Goodson struck the Blow , a Debate arose between the Court and the Jury ; afterwards they came to this Result , That the matter should at present be found Special , & c. Christian Weeks of St. Martins in the Fields , was tryed for the wilful Murther of one John Adam Hendrick on the 10th of May , giving him a mortal wound with a Sword value 2 s. near to the right pap of the depth of 6 Inches . It was sworn that the prisoner and the deceased quarrelled in the street about parting Two Men who were fighting , and that the deceased was very rude upon him , and drew his Sword first and gave him great provocation . There being but one Evidence against him , and no Malice propense proved , he was acquitted . Sarah Rhoades , was tryed for the murder of her Female Bastard Infant on the 12th day of May . It appeared upon the Tryal , that the prisoner was found alone in a Chamber , and the Child laid across the Chamber-pot ; but there was no great matter of harm about the Child , yet the Child died about five of the clock on the next morning . Other Evidence declared , that the prisoner was afterwards heard to express herself very affectionately towards the Child , tho ' at first she said she had the Cholick , and was unwilling to have it discover 'd . The Evidence was somewhat circumstantial , and the prisoner declared her Innocency at the Tryal , so she was acquitted . John Powel Gent . who was lately Outlawed for the murder of one William Roberts , was now tryed for the same , for that he gave him a mortal wound near the short Ribs of the depth of 18 Inches , on the 13th day of February in the first year of the Reign of the late King James . The Evidence declared , that the prisoner fled away , and desired that Mr. Roberts might be lookt after in a Field near Stepney , for that he feared he was in a bad condition , or words to that effect ; and being searcht after , Mr. Roberts was found alive in the Field near Stepney Church , and groaned much , wishing that he were at home , after which he instantly died . It appeared further , that the prisoner 's hand was bloody when he came to a house in Stepney in order to make his Escape . The prisoner said , that he knew nothing of it , for his going away was to visit his Friends . But that did not take with the Court upon which he call 'd his Officer , who said that he had always behaved himself civilly ever since he had been under his Command . Upon the whole , there being no Evidence to prove that he killed him , he was thereupon acquitted . Anthony St. Leager of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was arraigned and tryed for Felony and Burglary , in breaking the Dwelling house of George Jones Esq ; on the 10th of May , 1689. between the hours of 8 and 12 in the Night , and took away one Lute string Mantua Gown value 7 l. another Silk Gown 4 l. a Silk Peticoat with four Gold Galooms 5 l. an Indian peticoat 8 l. a crimson peticoat laced with Gold 6 l. a Lute-string Gown 3 l. 10 s. a sattin peticoat lac't 40 s. with abundance other Goods of great value , & c.

Whitwood said , it was found in a Trunk at one Joseph Pantalina 's in Hatton-Garden , which one Charles Hughes a Thief said was St. Leager 's Trunk , but the prisoner denied that he knew any thing of the Trunk , or whatever else was charged against him . All that could be proved as to that was , that St. Leager 's Wife was wont to open the Trunk . Mr. Whitwood did not deny but that he gave the Gown to his Daughter , and that he had it among some old things of Sir Adam Oatley 's that was in that Trunk , but Mr. Jones was very positive that the Gown belonged to him ; yet the Evidence being not so positive against him as might have been expected , and St. Leager stifly denying all , he was acquitted of that Indictment , & c.

Pratt confest that Jones told her she might take away Lace to the value of 6 l. and her Master , viz . Stephens could not miss it .

It appeared that Hughes and some others met Seymour upon the Road , going from London to Eling , and took away a white coloured Mare value 3 l. a Bridle and a pannel , and a small Sum of Mony . The Evidence against the prisoner was Seymour himself , and others , who said the Mare was Seymours , and that the Mare was taken away violently , & c.

MATTHEW CRONE Gentleman , was Indicted and Tryed for High-Treason Committed against our Most Gracious Sovereign Lord and Lady King William and Queen Mary , in having and holding Correspondence with the late King James , and Queen Mary , both in France and Ireland , endeavouring thereby to Depose our King and Queen of their Royal Crown and Dignity , and to Raise War and Rebellion in this our Kingdom of England , and a Miserable Slaughter , amongst their Majesties Subjects , to bring to pass and procure , against the Duty of his Allegiance , and against the form of the Statute in that Case made and provided , & c. The Tryal was long in hearing on both sides , and great Indulgence was extended towards him by the Court , as ever was shewed to any Man in the like Circumstance at that Bar ; the Evidence was clear and positive against him , as to every point of the Charge of the Indictment , and he had all the Advantage of a fair Tryal , but yet notwithstanding he used several Evasions , ( and Inforced , ) by way of Extenuations , several frivolous Excuses , to perswade the Court that he was Innocent , which did not take on his side . So the Gentlemen of the Jury were Ordered to withdraw , which they did , for several Hours , and then their Keeper came down and acquainted the Court , that they could not agree upon a Verdict . Yet the Court was pleased to wait patiently upon them till it was late at Night , and then they were of the same Mind , so the Court Ordered them to be Lock 'd up , without any manner of Sustenance , or Candle-Light , allowing them Gowns and Caps , and somewhat to Lie upon . On Saturday Morning the Court met again , but the Jury could not then Agree , One or Two of them making some particular Scruples , which were Resolved by the Court , although it was Twelve or One a Clock before they were United to Return a Verdict , and then they brought him in Guilty of High-Treason . After which Mr. Crone , the Prisoner , Prayed for an Arrest of Judgment , for that he had several Exceptions to make , desiring that Councel might be Assigned him to Argue to his Exceptions in Point of Law , in Case any Point arose . So he Prayed that Five Councel might be Assigned , to which the Court gave their Consent , and Ordered that a Court should be held for the same purpose , ( and to put an end to the Prisoner 's Scruples , ) on Thursday the Twelth of this Instant June , by Seven of the Clock in the Morning , after which the full Tryal will be Printed at Likewise Anthony St. Leager had Their Majesties pardon .
