John Tomkins . On Sunday the 18th of September last , about 11 o'Clock at Night , by Fleet-Lane , Robert Stevens , the Chimney-sweeper , came up to me first and seized me , and held me fast round the Body , while William Russel took the Money out of my Pocket ; Russel run away , and then Stevens endeavoured to throw me down . Q . Had you ever seen Stevens before ? Tomkins . He forced himself into my Company in a House , and scraped Acquaintance with me , and said he knew my Mother , and desired me to give him a Glass of Liquor ; which I did . Q . What did Russel do to you ? Tomkins . Russel put his Hand into my Pocket , and took out three Guineas and an half , and some Silver , and run away . Stevens afterwards run away , I pursued him and took him , and told him , they had got my Money ; he said he had not , but he would carry me to the Person who had it ; we went into George-Yard , and when I came there , Russel knocked me down ; and by the Ball in George-Alley , I was knocked down again and beat , so that I could not see out of my Eyes for several Days . Q . Had they any Weapons with them ? Tomkins . I do not know , but I received a Wound across my Hand , which seemed to be like the Cut of a Knife . Q . How do you know these were the Persons ? Tomkins . Stevens was never out of my Sight . Prisoners . Was not you drinking with us at a Brandy-Shop , and proposed to lay a Wager ? Tomkins . We were there , and Stevens said he was to fight one Buckhorse , a famous Fellow for fighting - I did offer to lay a Wager , and pulled all the Money I had out of my Pocket , - there was Gold and Silver , and Half-pence with the Gold . - I pulled it out to pay the Reckoning . Q . Did not you offer to make this Matter up ? Tomkins . I was offered Money by a certain Person to make it up , but I would not do it . Court . Were you ever acquainted with these People before you saw them at the Brandy-Shop ? Tomkins . Never to be acquainted with them , but I have frequently seen these Fellows about the Market , as my Mother keeps the Market . Q . How came you by this Money ? Tomkins . I saved it up by Degrees . Jonathan Perkins . I am a Watchman ; I was going along between Rose and Crown-Court and George-Alley , and heard an Outcry , and saw the Prosecutor , who was fell down upon his Hands ; and Robert Stevens , who was coming out of the Court ; he got away ; but with the Assistance of Young , I took him ( I know nothing of the Robbery ) he run away after that ; and I was forced to call another Man to my Assistance , and took him again - I know nothing of Russel , only by seeing him about , and that he keeps Company with a common Woman . William Boomer , the Constable : As I was going from Guildhall to Newgate with Stevens , he said , he was not the Man that took the Money ; but , says he , I know who did ; and he named one they called Doctor , who lives at Cow-Cross , and is a Butcher ; so I took up this Doctor , and brought him to the Prosecutor ; and the Prosecutor said , he was not the Man ; on the Saturday following I took this Russel ; and when the Prosecutor saw him , he owned him directly , and said , he was the Person that took the Money out of his Pocket . Q . How came you to take him up ? Boomer . I took him by the Description of the Prosecutor ; who said , he should know him again ; he was looking about , and I thought that he was the Person ; when I took him , he said , he could prove where he was that Night ; I asked him where he lay , he said , he lay in Charter house-lane ; and afterwards , he said , he lay in St Giles 's ; and there was a Woman , who belonged to him , said , that he lay in Goswell street . William Monk . I was with the Constable at the taking of William Russel , one Saturday Night , in the Market ; I told him , I had a strong Suspicion of his being concerned in the Robbery , on the Saturday [ Sunday ] Night before , he said , he could prove where he lay that Night ; he said , he lay in Charter-house-lane ; then , he said , he lay in St Giles 's ; there was a Woman , that he called his Wife , and I asked her where he lay , and , she said , he lay in Goswell-street ; says I , the Woman you call your Wife , says , you lay in Goswell-street ; says he , I lay in Charter-house-square ; and , she said , indeed we lay in Goswell-street . Edward Young . On Sunday was three Weeks I heard a Quarrel - I can not say whether it was the 18th of September ; I think it was on Sunday was three Weeks ; hearing a Quarrel , I came out of my House ; and Mr Tomkins called out Watch , and said , he was robbed ; I run to his Assistance , and another Man with me ; the Prosecutor seemed , in all Appearance , as if he had been fighting - I only saw Stevens at that Time ; I did not see any body else . Q . Was the Prosecutor in Liquor ? Young . I believe he had been drinking - I can not take upon me to swear , whether he was in Liquor , or not ; I was sent for to the Watch-house by the Constable ( after the Prisoner was taken up ) to ask me what I saw of the Matter ; I acquainted him of what I have told you - they were rumbling and tumbling about - I know Stevens is a Chimney-sweeper ; I know nothing of Russel . Ruth Cotton . I heard a Cry of stop Thief , and a Call of Watch , in George-alley ; I looked out of the Window , and heard a Person ask another what he made a Noise for , and struck him , and knocked him down , but I can not tell who did it . Samuel Orange . I had been beating the Hour of twelve in Shoe-lane , and went to the Watch house ; I had not been there above two Minutes , before Stevens was brought in ; A n't , please you , said he , to the constable , I did not rob the Man , but I know who did ; Mr Tomkins , the Prosecutor , was very much beat , and his Face manl 'd - I have known him a great while ; he served his Time just by our Watch-house - the Prosecutor was very sober between six and seven in the Evening ; I can not tell whether he was drunk then ; when a Man is beat and abused so , one can not tell whether he is drunk or no . John Lee . I lodge at Mr Abel Wood 's , at the Vine-Tavern in the Fleet-Market . Tomkins . There is no such Tavern . Lee . On the 18th of September Mr Tomkins came into Mr Wood 's House , with a Man , which I take to be Stevens the Chimney-Sweeper , Arm in Arm , in a friendly Manner ; when they came in they asked for a Dram ( I am Cellar-Man to the Gentleman where Mr Wood is Clerk , and Mr Wood desires me to go behind the Counter sometimes , and serve Liquor ) Stevens said , he had no Money ; said Tomkins , It shall cost you nothing here , call for what you please ; and they ordered a Dram of Gin ; in the mean Time , came in a Man , who said , Mr Tomkins , You are the Man , who offered to fight any Man upon a publick Stage , here is a Man will fight you for a Guinea ; the Man was a Stranger to me ; before they came in , they had a Dispute , and Tomkins said to the Man , who came in , You pretend to fight , you know nothing of fighting ; said Tomkins , I can fight upon a Stage if I please , but I do not love to expose myself ; says the other , Here 's a Man that shall fight you for a Guinea To-morrow ; Tomkins put his Hand into his Pocket and drew out 5 s. in Silver , a Six-pence , and some Half-pence ; says he , This is all the Money I have now , but I will make it a Guinea To morrow , or This shall go ; taking hold of his Coat ; and the other said , he should fight him for a Guinea ; thereupon some Words arose ; said I , This is a peaceable House , we will have no Quarrelling here ; so I went to turn them out - I believe he was not very sober , nor very drunk ; I know the Man was rational ; because , there was a Hole broke in the Door ; says he , Mrs Wood , I am a Carpenter ; I will use your House , if you will employ me ; said Mrs Wood , Mr Tomkins , I have no Occasion at present ; but , if I had , I am engaged to another ; I believe this Man staid about a Quarter of an Hour , and then I went to Bed ; sometime afterwards , Mr Wood came up to me , and said , John , do you remember those Men who were in the Shop just now ; Tomkins says , he was robbed ; I went to the Watch-house , and saw Tomkins and Stevens both very much suddled , and quite different from what they were in the Shop ; the Constable asked Tomkins some Questions ; and he said , he had been in our Shop six Hours ; said I , You have not been there above half an Hour , for I was there all the Time - they had two Glasses of Cherry-Brandy ; said Tomkins , what is that ; said I , a Penny ; a Half-penny a Glass ; said Tomkins , if Cherry-Brandy is so cheap , we will have two Glasses more , which they had - Mr Wood keeps a Brandy-Shop as well as a Tavern . William Gordon . I have known Stevens these seven Years , he has the Character of a very honest Fellow ; I asked him some Questions about the Robbery ; he said , he knew nothing of the Money ; he only knew that they were drunk together ; I heard the Prosecutor say , that he would hold Stevens , and would not let him go ; and , he says , Stevens held him . Prosecutor . That was when I took him . Thomas Gray . I have known Stevens sixteen Years ; I have worked with him at Gentlemens Houses ; I never heard any Thing amiss of him ; he bore a very honest Character for any Thing that I know . Henry Buzzine . I have known him sixteen Years ; we were Fellow Servants and Bed-Fellows ; and I never knew him to wrong Man , Woman , or Child ; he is a very good honest young Fellow . Dorcas Holmes . I have known Robert Stevens about ten Years , he was Fellow-Servant with me about a Month , and is one of the honestest Fellows I ever knew in my Life . Jane Rice . I have known him between seven and eight Years , and never knew him to do any Harm or Injustice to any body . Mary Foster . I have known him ten or twelve Years , he is an honest hard working Man . William Beddel . On Sunday the 18th of September , at Night , William Russel came Home to his Lodging at my House , in Charter-house-lane , about eleven o'Clock at Night , or it might be upwards of eleven - it might be near half an Hour after eleven ; he had lodged with me between three and four Months at the Time the Robbery was committed , and behaved very well during that Time - it is about a Quarter of a Mile from George-alley to my House . John Rippen . I am a Cordwainer , and so is Russel ; I met him the 20th Day of last Month , and asked him where he was going , he said , he was going to try to get some Work ; said I , William , I hear you are rich , can you afford to great me with a Pint of Bear ; he said , he had not so much Money about him ; I asked him to lend me a Half-penny ; for , I said , I had not a Farthing in the World , but he could not ; and he worked with my Master till he was taken up for this Robbery ; I believe , if he had any Money he would have given me a Pint of Beer ; he is a very honest Fellow ; my Father has intrusted him to receive Money for him , and he never wronged him of a Farthing in his Life , that I know of ; he learned his Trade of my Father - I have known him thirteen Years . - Baxter , and - Hullony , were next Door Neighbours to Russel , have known him eight or nine Years , and never knew any Harm of him . John Strong . I have known Russel ever since he was a little Lad ; he always worked hard for his Bread ; I never heard or saw any thing of him but what was honest in my Life . Samuel Murray . I have known him for three Quarters of a Year , and know that he is an honest Lad , and used to work hard at his Business . Both Acquitted . 463.

I was behind the Counter , putting some Goods up , and saw a Piece of Goods fall out of the Window ; my Mistress called to me , and told me , that a Woman had taken a Piece of striped Cotton out of the Window ; I pursued the Prisoner , and took her ; and took this from under her Cloak . Prisoner . Mr Cole said before the Alderman that he saw me take it ? Charles Cole . I did not say so . Prisoner . My Hands were very dirty , and the Alderman said , I looked like a hard working Girl . Guilty . When the Prisoner was going out of the Court , she said O - d - you all . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 464 . + Ann Clayton , of St Botolph without Aldersgate , was indicted for breaking open the Dwelling House of Henry Barlow , on the 7th of September , in the Night-time , and stealing twelve large Silver-Buttons , value 22 s. twenty-six Waistcoat ditto , value 28 s. four Silver Snuff-boxes , value 2 l. 11 s. one Snuff-box , value 8 s. four Silver-Spoons , value 40 s. four Tea-Spoons , value 8 s. a half Pint Silver Mug , value 2 l. 11 s. one Silver Waiter , value 35 s. and four Corals , with Silver Sockets and Bells , value 30 s. the Goods of Henry Barlow . Henry Barlow . I live at the Blackmoor's-Head in Barbican : my House was broke open September the 7th , at Night ; it was fast about ten o'Clock , when I went to Bed ; there was a Piece of the Shutter of the Shop taken out by the Help of a Knife and a Gimblet , as I suppose , by the Appearance of it ; the Hole was big enough to put an Arm through ; the Plate that I lost stood within reach of that Hole , and must be taken out that way : The Prisoner pledged with Mr Kay a Snuff-Box , a Coral , and a Tea Spoon : On Friday September 9 . I advertised them ; and Mr Kay came to me , and told me , he found by an Advertisement , that I had lost such and such Things ; showed them to me , and asked me if they were mine , and I said they were ; these are part of them . Prisoner . How can you swear to those Things which have no Mark upon them . William Kay . These Things were brought to me by the Prisoner on the 8th of September , with a Callimanco Petticoat ; and I lent her 25 s. upon them all ; an Advertisement coming out , I looked over my Day Book , to see if I had taken in such Things , and I found that I had ; I went to Mr Barlow , and told him , there was a Woman had brought to my House yesterday a Snuff-Box , a Corral , and a Spoon ; says he . There 's no particular Mark upon them , but I believe if I was to see them I should know them ; I showed them to him , and he said , they were his ; and desired me , if the Woman came again to stop her , which I promised I would ; I had not been at Home above an Hour and an half before the Woman came again to take these Things out from the Petticoat , but I refused it ; and asked her how she came by them ; she said she had bought them in the Neighbourhood , and made some little Sort of a Motion to go . I said I would stop the Things and enquire about it ; she said I need not go , for she had actually bought them . and that she bought them in Turnmill-street . I said it was very odd that she should buy such Things as these in the Street , ( as she deals in old Cloaths she might have bought a Petticoat in the Street , ) but she still continued in the Story , that she bought them of a Man in the Street ; but she would have gone away , and have left them in my Possession : She said she had them weighed , but could give no Account of the Weight , and that she gave 19 s. for them , which I suppose she thought might be about 5 s. per Ounce . I took her to be a very different Woman from what I find her to be , for I have known her a great many Years . Prisoner . I bought them very innocently ; he looked like a decent creditable looking Man , and said his Wife was dead , and he had a Mind to sell them . I bought them at a fair Market Price ; he asked me a Guinea for them , and I gave him nineteen Shillings . Elizabeth Turner . I was going out to washing , and coming along Turnmill-Street , I met the Prisoner , and a Man came up to her and asked her where there was a Pawnbroker 's : She said there was one here and one there , and told him , if he had got any thing to sell she would buy them ; he asked her 20 s. for the Snuff-Box and Coral , and she bid him 19 s. and she pulled off her Petticoat and pawned it with these Things to raise the Money to pay for them . - I think it was the 8th of this Month , it was the first Day of the Borough Fair ; - she knew me an Infant . Susannah Cartwright . On the 8th of September , I happened to meet the Prisoner , says she , Sut , will you go to see the Borough Fair ? Says I , I will go To-morrow , but I can not go To-day ; we sat down at the Door of a Publick-House , I think it is the Sign of the Trumpet or Horn , and a decent looking Sort of a Man , pretty well dressed , came to her and said , Mistress can you tell me where there is a Pawnbroker 's Shop ; says she , here 's one here , and another there . She said if he had got any thing to sell , she would buy it ; so he pulled out a Snuff-Box and a Coral , and said his Wife was dead , and he had a Mind to dispose of them ; says she , Sue , here 's a Coral it will serve for my Child when I lie in ; I laughed and said , What are you with Child ? She asked him what he would have for them ; he said 20 s. and she gave him 19 s. said she , You will stay with the Man while I go and get the Money ; and she said she would go and pawn her Petticoat to make up the Money . I saw her loosen her Petticoat , as if she was going to take if off , and she came back in less than a Quarter of an Hour , and brought 20 s. The Man staid by me all the Time she was gone ; - he trusted her with the Things while she went and got the Money . Walter Buckland . I have known the Prisoner eight or nine Years . I knew her when I was Apprentice ; I never heard any Harm of her . - Hornblower . I have known her thirty Years ; she is a Person of a very good Character ; I know her to be a very honest Woman . Peter Davis , Mary Jones , Sarah Jones , and two other Witnesses gave her the Character of an honest Woman : One of them had known her thirty Years , and another said he had trusted her with Cloth to sell , that he could not sell in his Shop , and she always paid him very honestly . Acquitted . 465 . + John Davis was indicted for stealing a Silk Handkerchief , value 2 s. 6 d. the Goods of Jacob Diass , privately from his Person , Oct. 4 . Jacob Diass , On Saturday the 4th of October , about five o'Clock in the Afternoon , as I was going along by St Paul 's , I felt a Motion at my Pocket , I immediately clapp 'd my Hand to my Right Pocket , and found that my Handkerchief was gone ; I turned to the Left , and saw the Prisoner standing with my Handkerchief hanging out at the Breast of his Coat . - I took particular Notice of him ; he is very remarkable because he has but one Hand ; he begged to be released ; the Boys would have pumped him , but I think this is the best Way to get rid of these Fellows who insest the Streets . John Hotchkis . I was going along with Mr Diass , and saw him take the Handkerchief from the Prisoner ; Mr Diass went to give him a Blow with his Stick ; he ran away but was soon taken ; he fell down on his Knees , and begged to be released , but I advis 'd Mr Diass to charge a Constable with him . - I believe this to be the Handkerchief . Prisoner . I was passing by the Gentleman , and he gave me a Blow over the Head ; it is very strange that a Man should pick a Pocket who has but one Hand . Guilty 10 d . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 466. Judith Frost , of St Giles in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Sheets , value 6 s. the Goods of Conway Rickaby , Oct. 6 . Elizabeth Rickaby . I lost a Pair of Sheets off my Bed last Thursday Evening ; I left a young Woman to take Care of the House while I went out , and when I came Home I missed the Sheets ; the young Woman said , no body had been in the House since I went out , and I fancy the Person that took them must come in at the Garret Window . Martha Selby . The 6th of this Instant the Prisoner came to Mrs Lee , to sell a Pair of Sheets ; she said it was for a poor Woman that was really in Necessity , but my Mistress did not care to buy them ; then she said she must pawn them , and my Mistress desired me to go and pawn them ; I went in a good-natured Way , and was stopped with them . Sarah Lee . The Prisoner brought the Sheets to me to sell ; I told her , I did not want any ; she said she did it for a poor Woman in Necessity , and must pawn them if she could not sell them , and she could trust me better than any body . I told her I never went to pawn any Thing , but I would send my Servant ; my Servant went with them , and was stopped ; I kept the Prisoner till I got a Warrant and secured her . Ann Stringer . There was a Pair of Sheets brought to my House to pledge , and I stopped them . Guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 467 . + James Orr was indicted for stealing a black Gelding , value 7 l. 7 s. the Property of John Darnel , Sept. 16 . John Darnel . On the 16th of September , I had a Horse stole out of Hackney-Marsh , and I found the Horse in Smithfield , in Mr Orr 's Man 's Hand , leading him to be sold ; he was in the Marsh the 14th , between five and six in the Evening ; Mr Orr said before my Lord Mayor that he bought him at his own House for 50 s. that he was brought to his House on Wednesday the 14th , but that he would not buy him till next Day . Q . Have you any Person to the Fact ? Darnel . I can bring half the Parish if you please . Prisoner . I deal in Hay and Straw , & c. and live in Whitechapel ; a Man brought the Horse to me and asked me if I could help him to a Chap to sell it , and he should be obliged to me ; I said if he came to me To-morrow I would either buy him or help him to a Chap for it ; it was an old Thing worth about 50 s. I bid him put him into the Stable among the rest of the Horses ; which he did , and he came again the next Morning , and then I cheapned him before Mr Sweeting , at the Red Cow , and some other Persons . I paid the Fellow 50 s. for the Horse , and gave him one Shilling for himself , and told him , if I made 10 s. or more Profit of it . I would give him something more ; the Horse was owned in Smithfield by the Prosecutor ; I told him , if the Horse is stole I must be the Sufferer . I delivered him the Horse , and lost my Money and Charges . Richard Alexander . The Prisoner keeps the Elephant and Castle in Whitechapel ; I have a House in that Yard , and as I came out on Thursday in the Morning , I saw Mr Orr buy this Horse , and pay the Man 50 s. for him ; he sent him to Smithfield on Friday , and offered him to be sold for 3 l. 10 s. - Askew . I live at the George in Smithfield ; Mr Orr has the Character of a very honest Man ; I believe there are a great many Innkeepers would have appeared to his Character if he had desired them ; any Person may happen to buy a Horse that is stole if he is never so careful . Acquitted . 468 . + Abraham Pass , of St Bennet Gracechurch , was indicted , for that he on the 28th of July , about the Hour of One in the Night , did break and enter the Dwelling of Thomas Beate and John Dawson , and stole from thence 250 Ells of Linnen Cloth , val . 8 l. their Property . Thomas Beate . On the 28th of July last , our House was broke open by the taking up of a Plank which goes down into the Cellar ; the Prisoner confessed it was between twelve and two ; - I found it out by the Watchman who came and told me that the Cellar was broke open , and that they had taken the Prisoner with some of the Goods which are mentioned in the Indictment . I saw the Cellar fastened , as usual over Night ; they got in by slipping back a Plank , so as to put in an Iron Crow to raise it up , - it was 12 o'Clock the Day following before I heard of it , and by the Description which the Prisoner gave the Watchmen of the Place , I thought it must be my House ; there were five Pieces of Oznaburgh stole , and two Pieces of Fear Nothings ; these three Pieces of Oznaburghs are my Goods , the rest I have not heard of . Patrick Ewin . I am a Watchman in Aldgate Ward 's ; I thought I heard two Men quarrelling ; they proved to be Jews , I thought their Language was quarelling . I saw the Prisoner with two of these , Pieces upon his Back in a Sack , and his own Garters tied round it ; and the other walked Cheek by Jole along with him ; He dropped the Goods , and endeavoured to get off , but I secured him , and brought him to the Watch-house ; I run after the other but could not overtake him ; says I , If he has got such a Load as this upon his Back he can not run away with it , and at Surgeon Sharpe 's Door I found another Piece ; ( that Night he wanted to send for a Man who lives in Rosemary-Lane , that buys stolen Goods ) said I , You Rascal , I have got another Piece that your Comrade had . - He said they pushed with their Feet against the Cellar-Door , and then wrenched it open ; he sent for another Jew to be an Interpreter , and he directed us to the Place where he took them from ; said he , You know where you took me ? Yes , said I , Why then , said he , turn down by the End of the Street , and there 's a Court with an Alehouse in it , there I got them ; I went to Mr Beate 's House in Talbot-Court , and told him he was robbed ; robbed , said he , and laughed at me ; but when he came to look into the Warehouse he found he had been robbed : The Prisoner owned that was the the third Time they had robbed that Gentleman in that Cellar ; Mr Beate desired me to go into the Cellar ; I went down and saw a great many Pieces of the same sort of Goods , and I told him what I took from the Prisoner were the same Sort , with the same Mark ; and when he shewed us how they got in , we found it to be very easy to get in . John Balding . When he was in the Counter , he told me he stole these Goods from a House in Talbot-Court ; he said they broke open the Cellar-door , and shewed me which Way they did it . Prisoner . I am a Stranger in England ; I do not know the Name of the Court , nor the Name of the Street ; how can they swear this ? Ewin . He said they should have got 50 l. worth of Goods that Night , if I had not seen them . Q . Was the Plank fast or loose the next Morning ? Beate . The Plank was laid down in such a Manner that by shoving it they could take it up , and they might lay it down again with Ease . - The Plank , and the Place it was fastened to , were worn away ; I did not know it could be so easily moved , or I would have taken Care to have prevented them . Guilty , * Death . * The Prisoner was Evidence last September against Richard Clay who was Acquitted . See Sessions Paper . Fol . 229 . Trial 383 .

Joseph Hudder . Sept. 28 about eight o'Clock in the Evening , the Prisoner pledged this Coat with me ; I asked him whose it was , he said , it was his own ; said I , it is too big for you ; and , he said , he bought it second Hand in Monmouth-street ; I showed it to Mr Blackford ; he suspected the Prisoner , as coming after a young Man that lodged in the House .

Clayton 's Maid Servant . We had some Workmen at the House , and the Prisoner used to come in , and talk to them ; Margaret Barnard , a Woman that he keeps Company with , told me , he had the Pistol , which put me into a great Fright : I had suspected the Prisoner before , because he was absent for two or three Days ; I did not miss the Pistol till two or three Days after it was gone ; it was stole out of the Kitchen or the Pantry - I did not let him have it to pawn .

Prisoner . I had a Warrant to take up the Prosecutrix , and one Longstaff , a Fellow that she keeps Company with ; this shows the Maliciousness of the Prosecution ; she lives in a little Alley in the Strand , and was at the Alehouse over-against her House ; did not you come into the Alehouse , and abuse me , that Day you say these Things were lost ? This Woman lodged in my House about six or seven Years ago ; did not you ? Q . Did you lodge in his House about six or seven Years ago ? Ann Dawson . No ; he will say any Thing . Prisoner . She went to Justice Frasier to swear this Robbery against me , and he would not take her Oath , he found her in so many Stories . Ann Dawson . There was a Lodger of mine that he had a Warrant against , who hid herself behind the Curtain , when he took the Things out of my Drawers , she is one of my Evidences . Prisoner . The other Witnesses are all her Lodgers , they are all common Women of the Town . Mary Fitzmorris . On Friday before Michaelmas-Day , I came Home a little before nine at Night ; and I was desired to keep up till such Time as Mrs Dawson came Home , that I might not be confined , because the Prisoner had a Warrant against me ; the Prisoner came to Ann Dawson 's . and I went into the inner Room on the Ground-floor , to hide myself - I did not see him ; I was told , he pretended to come with a Constable ; and came in a very vile Manner , and swore he would have me ; he b roke open the Chamber door on the Ground floor , and then he broke open the Drawers , and took out something - I saw a sringed Table-cloth under his Coat - he did not look for me when he came into the Room , but went directly to the Drawers , and broke them open . Q . Did he think you were hid in the Drawers ? Fitzmorris . I can not tell that . Q . If he had looked about the Room might he have found you ? Fitzmorris . Yes , he might have found me ; I was hid behind the Curtain - I had lived with Mrs Dawson about a Month - when he had got the Table-cloth he went away directly ; I did not see him take any thing else . Jury . What had he to break open the Drawers with ? Fitzmorris . The Drawers were all locked , and the Key was in one of the Drawers . Q . Then he might have opened the Drawers with the Key ; did he break them open ? Fitzmorris . He broke them open , because the Key was broke . Jury . Did he break open the Door of the Room ? Fitzmorris . Yes - the Door was broke open , for I had locked myself in , but how he did it I can not tell . Q . Did you see him come in ? Fitzmorris . I did not see him at all - I did not see him that Night . Prisoner . She said , she was behind the Curtain , and that she did not see me ; and yet , she says , she saw me take out the Table-cloth ; I had the Constable with me then . Fitzmorris . The Constable was not there at all . Ann Williams . I never saw the Prisoner in my Life before he came into the House that Night , this was about eleven o'Clock , and the second Time of his coming ; the first Time he came was about nine o'Clock , he came and asked for the Gentlewoman of the House , Mrs Dawson ; he cursed and swore greatly , and bid me get out of the House ; he came again in half an Hour 's Time , and came in , in the same Manner ; he said , there was a young Woman in the House which he had a Warrant for ; that he was sure she was in the House , and he swore he would have her out ; he said , he was sure she was in that Room , and broke the Door open , and went in there , and then broke open the Drawers . Q . Was you in the Room with him ? Williams . No ; no-body but the young Woman , who was behind the Curtain ; I saw him , as he was going away , with the Fringe of the Tablecloth hanging out of his Pocket - I did not see the Constable near the House ; the first Time you came , there was a tall Man in a Snuff coloured Coat with you ; but the next Time you had no body at all with you - it was the Friday before Michael mas-Day - I am Mrs Dawson 's Servant - I never spoke to you in my Life before that Night ; only I have heard the Neighbours say what Sort of a person you are - it was the Chamber-door you broke open - I need not tell you what Time it was , for certainly you must know that . Sarah Howard . The Prisoner came into Mrs Dawson 's , in Bennet 's Court in the Strand , with a great many Oaths and Curses in his Mouth , and asked for Mrs Dawson , but she was not at Home ; he said , he came after another young Woman , and pretended to be a Constable , and said , he must see the young Woman ; I saw him break the Door open , but I did not see him take any Thing out of the Drawers . Prisoner . Was there any talk of the Door being broke open , when we were before the Justice ? There was no talk of any such thing then . Howard . I said the same then as I do now ; I insisted upon it then , that the Door was broke open . Ann Dawson . The Prisoner offered me twenty Guineas last Monday was a Week , to make it up , and brought Releases , but I would not do it . Prisoner . Please to see this Warrant ; this is a Warrant that I had to take up the Prosecutrix ; this is a very malicious Prosecution . Justice Deveil 's Clerk deposed , that this was a Warrant granted by the Justice ; Middlesex , & c. these are to command you , and every of you , to bring before me , or some other of His Majesty 's Justices of the Peace , the Bodies of John Longstaff , and Ann Dawson , otherwise Ford , otherwise Haynes , for assaulting Thomas Lewis , and knocking him down , by which he lost a Guinea and five Shillings , Signed , & c.

There was a Coat brought to George Gray to mend , the Prisoner had been at the Globe Alehouse in Crutebed-Fryars that Morning ; I believe an Hour ; Wood said , he believed the Man had stole his coat ; I pursued the Prisoner , and took him at the Navy Office Back-Gate , with the Coat just by him , about nine o'Clock , and brought him back ; he was stooping down , and seemed to shuffle something . George Gray . I had this Coat to mend ; I left it in my Stall but a little while , and when I came to look for it , it was gone . John Lock .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] 476 . + Thomas Kill , of Chelsea , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , & c. on the 6th of October , in the 17th Year of his present Majesty . upon Elizabeth , the Wife of John Berry , did feloniously make an Assault ; and her , the said Elizabeth , against her Will , did ravish , and carnally know against the Peace of the King , & c. and against the Form of the Statute , & c . Elizabeth Berry . On Thursday Sev'nnight , at Night , I went out of my own House just after the Clock struck nine , to see for my Husband ; and I found him at one Rowland Jackson 's , at the Turnpike , in the King 's Road at Chelsea - my Husband is a Labourer in Chelsea , he has been a good Husband ; he had another Man drinking with him ; I staid about a Quarter of an Hour ; they had a full Pot of Beer before them ; but when I came away , there was not above a Quarter of a Pint in it ; and , he said , he would come presently - I saw he was a little in Liquor : When I came to the White Stiles , facing Burton 's Court , it was very dark - ( I believe it was then half an Hour after nine ) I found that my Husband , who I expected to go with me , did not follow me ( for he turned down from me into Chelsea-Common , being in Liquor ) . I heard the Tread of Feet , and thought it was my Husband ; and my Spade-Bitch was with me ; I found him lying upon the Ground , and he was so suddled , that he could not get up ; I saw a Light coming over the Common from the Sign of the Cow and the Two Calves ; and when the Man came near me , I asked him if he would be so kind as to help my Husband up , and try to get him Home ; with that , the Man with the Light came to help my Husband up ; and the Prisoner was with him ; they hope my Husband up , as they said ; and they said , he could not stand ; and I believe he could not ; the Man said , If you will not go Home with your Wife , lie there , and be d - d ; and the Man went away with the Light , and the Prisoner with him ; I went a little Distance from my Husband , and thought he would come after me ; I took his Hat and Wig off , thinking he would be cold , and follow me ; he not coming , I went back again ; but he was not in the Place where I left him ; he was moved farther ; with that I saw a Light by the Sign of the Cow and the Two Calves ; I went thither , and then the Light was out ; so I did not knock , but came back again , and was going Home ; when I was got about half way over the Common ; the Prisoner came up , and laid hold of my Shoulder ; with that I was surprized ( I had got my great Spade-Bitch with me ) says he , Have you found the Man on the Common ? Is he gone Home ? With that , I said , What makes you ask that Question ; said he , By Reason I do ask you the Question ; then , said I , If you do ask me the Question , I will not resolve you ; with that , he said , I should go no further ; said I , Why shall I not go any further ? He said , You shall go no further , you shall stop here , for you want a Bed fellow ; and I 'll be your Bedfellow ; I said , I do not want a Bedfellow ; yes , you do , said he , and you shall not go any further ; he said , if you make any Noise . I will knock you down ; said I , but you shall not , Fellow ; you had better be quiet , for I know you ; though I did not , for I had never seen him before in my Life ; with that he got fast hold of me , and said . D - n you for a Newgate Bitch , do you know me ? With that he strove to get me down , and struck me on the Side of the Head ; I got fast hold of his Coat , and his Shirt , with that he shoved me , and did all he could to get me down , and then struck me on the other Side of the Head ; I kept hold of him , so that his Shirt and Coat tore with my holding him , with which my Hand gave way ; with that he put his Feet some how or other to my Heel , and got me down ; then I cried out Murder ; he said , it I cried out Murder again , he would cut my Throat ; said I For God 's Sake , Show Merey on me , and do n't kill me ; he said , if I spoke one Word more he would ; then , I said , to my Spade-Bitch , which I thought would seize any Body , seize him ; with that , says he , Do you say seize me , to your Dog ; I do not value you nor your Dog ; with that I begged of him to let me alone ; he said , If you will not let me have my Will of you , I will keep you here till one o'Clock in the Morning , if I do not murder you - he said , I will either keep you here till one o'Clock , or else murder you ; then , I said , he should not have his Will ; with that he began to use his Violence in his nasty Way ; then he asked me whether I would or not ; I told him I would not - I am not a young Girl ; for I am Mother of twelve Children - then he lay with me . Q . What do you mean by lying with you ? Elizabeth Berry . I mean that he had carnal Knowledge of me - he forced me ; I held out against him , till I had no Strength in me - he pulled my Legs open with his Hands [ there being a little Laugh about the Court , she said ] I knew these Things before I came here ; I expected to be laughed at , but it is not a laughing Matter - he abused me till I was so saint that I could speak no longer , and then he had his Will of me for a great while ; I am sure I thought it so - he had not done with me , in that way , I believe for the Space of half an Hour . Q . Had he his private Parts in your 's ? Berry . Yes , he had - not for all that Time - he had to do with me twice ; I thought he had done with me the first Time , but he had not - I believe it was half an Hour both Times put together - I cried out , and struggled all I could ; for I thought , at that Time , of Mr Smith , who was murdered in the Five Fields - it is a large Common that goes into the King 's Road near Chelsea Common . Q . Are there any Houses near the Place where he did this ? Berry . There 's the Cow and the Two Calves . Q . How far is it from that ? Is it a hundred Yards ? Berry . Yes , a great deal more than that - I do not think it was above a Quarter of a Mile - as near as I can guess , it was between ten and eleven o'Clock . Jury . It is a very bye Common ; there 's a Foot Path cross it ; but very few People care to go that way . Berry . It was as dark a Night , I think , as ever I saw from Heaven . Q . How did you part afterwards ? Berry . I said , you have used me very barbarously ; I hope as it is so late you will see me a little Way over the Common ; with that he said , I would see you over the Common , if I thought you would not raise any body upon me , or below me ; he said it was his Way home ; with that I told him I would not ; Said he , How shall I take your Word for that ; says he , You are going to betray me : I said no , I will not , as you have done such an Action as this , and as I have Children of my own , I would not have the Thing known . Q . You say he had carnal Knowledge of you , where you sensible of any Thing coming from him ? Berry . Yes , there did . - Moreover , some People said the Prisoner was not a clean Man , - I hope I shall not find it so ; we came together over the Common as far as the Fighting Cicks , and there was a Light up Stairs as if they were going to Bed ; the Gate was fastened up or else I would have apprehended him there ; then I came over by the Chesnut-Tree-Walk , by the White Stiles , and Burton's-Court was locked up ; said he , I doubt you are going to have me apprehended ; Where do you live ? I told him my House was on the far Side of the five Fields , ( which is a great Way off my House ) then he was very well contented to go along with me . They were all in Bed at the seven Houses : I passed by Mr Desborough 's the Constable , and they were in Bed . Q . What did he say to you after he had done what he did to you ? Berry . After I got off the Bed - Q . Off the Bed ! Berry . Off the Ground ; then he said , Now let me see what Money you have got , I told him I had none ; said he , Let me feel , with that he did feel in this Pocket I have on now ; says he , There is none in this Pocket sure enough ; said he , let me feel in the other Pocket , I said , I never wore but one Pocket . ( To return to the Story , ) After I passed by Mr Desborough 's , I turned to my own Door and gave a Rap ; my Daughter was in Bed and thought it had been her Father and me , so she came down in her Shift and open 'd the Door ; when the Door was opened he stepped just within the Threshold ; Oh , says he , there 's a Spinning-Wheel ; I then shut the Door in order to keep him in ; there are two Bolts and a Lock to the Door which I fastened , and set my Back against the Door ; said he , What am I come here for , I said I will tell you presently what you came here for , and I called out for Mr Tovey , a Man that lives in the House ; Mr Tovey put on his Cloaths as fast as he could , and came down ; says Tovey , What does this Fillow do here ; I told Mr Tovey how he had used me , and desired him to go for Mr Desborough the Constable ; Mr Tovey had not been down long before my Husband came . I said to the Prisoner , you would not let me go when I was upon the Common , and I will keep you here now , and I made him sit down in the Chair by my Desk ; and he told me he would make me sutter for keeping him . Q . When was it you sent for the Constable ? Berry . I went for the Constable , but he did not come that Night ; he was in Bed and said he could not get up , and could not find the Key of the Cage ; afterwards Mr Tovey went for the Constable , and left my Husband and I with the Prisoner ; - my Daughter was in Bed ; and he told Mr Tovey he could not come till Morning . Q . Who was with you when you made him sit down in the Chair ? Berry . My Daughter , who is 21 Years of Age , and Mr Tovey : As soon as he saw that we would send for a Constable , he down 'd on his Knees over and over , and begg 'd us to let him go , and offered to make Satisfaction . I told him before my Husband and Mr Tovey , what he had done ; he at first denied it , but he afterwards owned that he had done the Thing . - He owned he had Knowledge of me , that he felt in my Pocket , and that he would have robbed me if I had any Money . - I never saw him before he committed the Fact , and he owned that he never saw me before . I asked him his Name as I was coming Home , and he said his Name was Johnson . He owned before Mr Dunmore the Brewer - or Malster ; I can not tell which he is , he lives hard by Chelsea , and before Mr Gill the Apothecary , that he had done the Thing . Jury . Was you by when he owned it to Dunmore , and the other ? Berry . No , I was not . Council . Did not you ask the Prisoner to go Home with you ? Berry . No , I did not . Council . What ; did not you say just now that you did ? Berry . I asked him to go Home in order to get him secured . - I did not ask him before he had done the Thing - I had not been drinking with the Prisoner . - I was very sober . Council . You say the Prisoner was apprehensive you were going to apprehend him ; how came he to go home with you after he had that Mistrust ? Berry . Because I desired him to see me Home , and I told him I lived by the five Fields , tho ' I did not live there . Council . I think you said the Bitch was always ready to assist you if you cried out ; how came this Bitch to let this Man do all this to you ? Berry . She used to assist me , but the Prisoner had worked at one Douse 's a Basket-Maker 's , and the Dog used to lie at the Door , and I believe she knew the Prisoner 's Voice , for we lived that Way about a Quarter of a Year ago ; I think he must know the Bitch because she did not fly upon him . Council . How long might he be penetrating your Body ? Berry . Longer than I desired , as I told you before . Council . What did he penetrate it with ? Berry . With what other People do , and with what you do other People with . Council . How long was he in you the first Time ? Berry . I told you half an Hour in all ; how long Time would you have had me have said ? Q . After he had done the first Time ; how did he get you down again ? Berry . I never was up ; he would not let me get up ; he said he had not done with me . Q. I ask you , how long did he lie with you the first Time , when he first penetrated your Body ? Berry . I believe about a Quarter of an Hour . - I do not know whether he called to the Bitch or no . Q . You seem to be a stout strong Woman and kept him for some time in your House by yourself , how long did you keep him there ? Berry . No longer than the Time that Tovey was putting his Cloths on ? Q . Was it owing to your Fear or what , that you submitted to him so as to let him be Master of you for half an Hour together ? Berry . I did not submit at all , for when he pulled me open by Violence , I had not Power to resist . - I do not know where the Prisoner lives any otherwise , than that he is a Basket-Maker , and works with Mr Sadler ; Mr Sadler said if I would take Half a Guinea , he would give it me to make it up . John Tovey . As near as I can guess , between twelve and one o'Clock , Mrs Berry 's Daughter called me out of my Bed , and said , For God's-Sake come down , for here is a Man threatens to cut my Mother 's Throat ; when I came down Mrs Berry said , Mr Tovey , this Fellow has abused me very much , and I desire you would lend us your Assistance to keep him till we can charge a Constable with him . Mrs Berry would have gone for a Constable , but I did not care to say in the House with the Man by myself ; after I had said some Time , I said you had better let the Fellow go about his Business , for it will cost you a great deal of Trouble and some Expence if you swear this Thing against him ; she said he should answer for his Offence ; then the Prisoner dropped upon his Knees and begged to go home , and said he would make any Satisfaction . Mrs Berry made Answer . No you shall not go as you have threatned to cut my Throat and to rob me : Said she , You never offered to cut my Throat did you ? No , said he , You did not search my Pocket neither , did you ? Yes , said he , my Hand was in your Pocket , I believe . Q . Did she charge him with any particular Matter ? Tovey . She said he had lain with her twice by Force , or against her Will , or something like that . Q . Before you came down was the Woman 's Husband with her ? Tovey . He really was with her . - I never saw the Prisoner to my Knowledge before that Night . I know nothing of his Character ; I have heard of his Name , and where he worked . John Berry . It is true enough ( as my Wife says ) that I was suddled ; I was so suddled that I could not stand , and my Wife took my Hat and Wig off ; the Prisoner and another Man came over the Common , and the Man said , if I would not go home with my Wife I might lie there and be d - n 'd ; at last I fell asleep , and slept till twelve o'Clock or thereabout , and when I came Home I found the Prisoner and my Wife within my own Door ; says she , This Man has forced me against my Will , and has ruin 'd me ; said I , I am sorry to hear that , I wish I had gone Home at first if that 's the Story ; - She said he had lain with her twice , till she had hardly any Breath in her Body ; said I , are you not a vile Rogue to do so ? - He said he could not deny but he did it , and dropped down on his Knees and asked Pardon ; I told him , Fellow , you have done enough to bang you , and when you have done that to be betrayed Home by the Woman ! you foolish ignorant Blockhead . I said his asking Pardon would not do now , for he should be brought to Justice . - I did tell him he had ruined my Wife ; said I , Are you a clean Man ; he said he was . Q . Have you found that he was not ? Berry . I dare not come there yet for Fear . Council . Do n't you apprehend your Wife to be given to be in Liquor ? Berry . She will scold a little now and then , that is nothing at all to the Purpose . - I can not say but she may drink too much ; - I have been married to her 32 Years . Prisoner . A n't please you my Lord , Mrs Berry asked me to go Home with her ; said she , young Man , do go along with me over the Common to look for my Husband , and I will treat you with any Thing if you will go along with me ; which I did , and she persuaded me to go Home to her House . - I never did any such Thing to her , nor nothing like it ; I am as innocent of it as the Child unborn . George Davis . Mr Berry did send a Person from Mr Hopkins 's , who lives over-against me in Petty-France , Westminster , to acquaint me that he wanted to speak with me ; he made great Complaints of his Wife , and said she was a terrible drunken Creature , and he wanted to consine her , that he was an unfortunate poor Man , and had an unfortunate Wife . He said , when she is drunk she is in such Fits that I am afraid she will do me a Mischief some Time or other . - I keep a House to cure Lunaticks , - I pay 60 l. a Year Rent . Says he , if you will take her into you House she may make you a good Servant ; I said , I will have nothing to do with such a Creature , I will not take her into my House . - She is very bad as to drinking , I can not say what she is as to any Thing else . Thomas Hopkins . I know the Prosecutrix very well ; her Husband was a Coachman and lived at Chelsea , and kept the Stage , but what with her drinking and going to Law , I believe brought him very low ; that she used to get drunk and abuse him , and he has said he could not go home with Safety for her - I take her to be a Person that is not to be credited , I would not believe any thing she say . I keep the Black Horse Inn , in Petty-France , Westminster . John Figg . Mrs Berry 's Character is , that she is a vile , fottish , drunken Woman , and a great lieprobate ; I have heard her Husband upbraid with whoring and drinking . - I would not hang a Dog upon her Evidence . William Sadler . I took the Prisoner at twelve Years of Age , and have known him 13 Years . I never had a faithfuller Servant in my Life . Q . What is he as to his Modesty , or Immedesty ? Sadler . I never found him immodest in my I have three or four Daughters at Home , and some of them marriageable ; and if I thought he was given that Way he should not come into my House . I would trust my own Daughter with him , and if he was at Liberty I would employ him again . Council . There is a Reflection cast upon you that you should offer the Prosecutrix a Consideration to make this Affair up ; did you make any such Offer ? Sadler . I did offer half a Guinea Yesterday ; and To-day they would have taken it , but it was too late . - I offered it out of my own good Will to the Prisoner . - The Prisoner knew nothing of it indeed . Joseph Toone . I have known the Prisoner between ten and twelve Years ; he is always in his Work , and always behaved well . - I do not know that he would be guilty of any such Thing . John Hornsby . I have known the Prisoner 13 Years ; he has the Character of a very honest Fellow for what I know . - I never heard that he had the Character of an immodest Man , and do not think he is . Thomas Walter . I have known him nine Years , and never heard but that he bore the Character of an honest modest Man . Martha Cufford , ( called by the Prosecutrix ) I have known Mrs Berry about 13 Years , and I never heard any thing amiss of her : I have often employed her , and her Husband ; they were always very honest People . - I do not know that she is given to drinking - I have heard some People say so as they do now , but I never found her so . Acquitted . 477 . + Christopher Smith * of St Martin in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a Silk Purse , value 1 s. and six Guineas and a Half , and eight Shillings the Property of James Fitzgerald , Esq ; in the Dwelling-House of Augustine Copenal , September 16 . * The Prisoner was not only a Stranger to our Laws but our Language : On his Arraigment , Mr Lebat , ( one of the Jury ) interpreted to him the Indictment , and asked him if he was Guilty or not : He then acknowledged the Fact ; the Court however did not record the Plea , but ordered him to be inform 'd that the Consequence of his owning the Charge would be his suffering Death , but if he denied it , and the Prosecutors failed in their Proof , he would be Acquitted ; he was therefore induced to plead Not Guilty . He was then acquainted that he had a Right to insist on half the Jury to be Aliens ; he was indifferent as to that as he knew no body , but at last desired it ; and accordingly on his Trial , Raptale Jurquet , Nicholas Winchins , Lewis Lawrence , James Roboquet , Robert Vandervil , and James Emon , with fix of the other Pannci , were sworn on the Jury . And Mr Clenard was sworn to interpret between the Court , and the Prisoner . James Fitzgerald . On the 16th of September I lost six Guineas and an Half , and eight Shillings ; the Money was in a Purse ; I lodged in Mr Copenal 's House in Suffolk Street , and the Prisoner lodged in the same House . - I had no other Reason to suspect the Prisoner than the Money being found in the Bag of his Wig , in his Room , and in my Purse ; I had a Piece of Rhubath in my Purse , and I am sensible this is the same Piece which I had in my Purse ; here are six Guineas , an Half , and eight Shillings , and a Farthing , which were all in this Purse when I left it . Prisoner . They found in my Room just so much Money as the Gentleman says . The Prisoner being asked what he had to say for himself ; he said it was Necessity that obliged him to take this Money in order to pay his Landlord that he owed some Money to , for Fear he should not be able to get out of the Country ; that he is a Stranger here , and knows no body . Mr Copenal . The Prisoner was recommended to me by a Person in Holland for a Lodger . I never heard he had any Business here ; he has been with me these eight Weeks all but two Days . I took him for a Gentleman , and he has had his Living with me all the Time . - Hughes . I had a Warrant brought me by Mr Fitzgerald to search Mr Copenal 's House for some Money that he had lost , and I found this Wig hanging up against the Wall in the Prisoner 's Room , and in the Bag of the Wig was this Purse , with six Guineas , and an Half , and eight Shillings in Silver . Q . Did you ever see the Prisoner wear this Wig ? Copenal . I can not say that I ever saw him wear a Bag-Wig , I have seen this Wig in his Room , to the best of my Knowledge it does not belong to any body else , for no body went into his Room that I know of . Guilty , Death . The Jury said , that as the Evidence was positive as to the Specifick Money in the Purse , they could not lessen the Value , but recommended him to the Court as an Object of Mercy ; as the Prosecutor likewise did . 478. William Matthews , of St Peters in Cornhill , was indicted for stealing a Linnen Handkerchief , value 18 d. the Property of Simon Onely , October 10 . The Prosecutor not appearing the Prisoner was Acquitted . 479 , 480. Roger Dennis was indicted for stealing twenty Pounds weight of Iron , value 20 d. the Goods of the Mayor and Commonalty of the City of London ; and Mary Hurst for receiving the same knowing it to be stole , Sept. 9 . James Townsend . On the 9th of Sept. Mr Long brought Hurst to me , with this Iron ; I said , I believed it belonged to the Debtors-Window , on the common Side of Newgate , and she was for that Night sent to Woodstreet-Counter ; the next Day Mr Long and I went to the Debtors Side , and tallied these Irons to the Window , and they sitted exactly ; I asked Dennis ( who is a Prisoner for Debt ) whether he knew any thing of the taking them ; and , he said , he took them himself , and gave them to Hurst out of the Window to sell ; and she acknowledged she had them from him to sell . We lost about 200 weight . Dennis . I gave it to this Woman to carry over to the Lodge . Mary Hurst . No , Mr Dennis , you gave it me to sell for you ; you said , you wanted Tobacco , and that it was your own . - Long . Upon Friday Sept. 9 , I was at Robert Walton 's in Fleet-lane ; and the Prisoner , Mary Hurst , came in to sell this Iron , it weighed twenty-one Pound ; she offered it for a Penny per Pound : and Walton agreed with her for three Farthings per Pound , and she sold the whole for 16 d. I asked her how she came by it ( here are three large Bolts , three Nuts , and three large Spikes ) she said , a Workman gave it to her to sell , and said , it was his Perquisites ; that she was to have no Share in it ; I told her , I had Authority to know , and would know how she came by it ; and then , she said , if I would go with her , she would show me how she came by it ; then Walton said , Give me the Money again , I do not know how you came by it ; I will have nothing to do with it ; I will not have any Trouble about it ; she said , one Dennis gave it to her to sell , and if I would go with her she would show me the Man ; I asked Dennis if he gave the Woman this Iron to sell , and he said , he did ; I asked him how he came by it , he said honestly ; I went over to the Lodge , and showed it to Mr Townsend , and asked him if he knew it ; he said , it belonged to the Portcullises of the Window , on the Debtors Side ; Dennis owned , a second Time , that he gave it Hurst to dispose of ; I asked him how she was to dispose of it ; he said , he did not care how ; I went to the Place where I apprehended it was taken from , and put the Bolts into the Holes , and the Nuts upon them , and called Dennis , and asked him if he took them out there , and he said , yes ; I asked him how he got them out , he said , he knocked them off with a Hammer ; I asked him what made him take them out , he said , he did it to louse himself ; for the Bars were so thick , and the Place so dark , that he could not see to louse himself . Prisoner Dennis . All the whole Ward took them down ; they were all concerned in it . Mary Hurst . Dennis gave me these to dispose of , and I did not know but they were his , and thought he would give me a Penny for my Trouble : About twelve Months ago , when my Husband was a Prisoner there , we hindered the Goal from being broke twice , and were offered five Pounds to help them to break the Goal ; and I sent a Letter to Mr Akerman , to give him Notice of it . Mr Akerman being called , said , that about a Twelve-month ago , when her Husband was a Prisoner there , she did give him some Information , from her Husband , of such a Design , and believes that the Goal was prevented from being broke by that Means ; and being asked how Dennis behaved , he said , he could not say that he behaved amiss .

It appeared , upon the Evidence , that Mr Thomas Wayne , had a Letter from his Father , the said John Wayne , directing him to pay to the Prisoner 's Brother 20 l. and to take his Note of Hand for it ; that the said J - W - came to his Chambers , on the 6th of September ; said his Name was W - , and asked if he had not Orders to pay him 20 l. Mr Wayne said , he had ; whereupon the Prisoner wrote the Note in Question , and signed it with his Brother 's Name ; and Mr Wayne then paid him the Money . Mr Lewis Russel , happening to be in the Chambers , and being afterwards informed by Mr Wayne of what had passed , said , he was sure that was not the Person he pretended to be ; upon which a Warrant was taken out , and the Prisoner found and apprehended . On being carried before Justice Frasier , he acknowledged the Receipt of the Money , and that the Note was of his Hand-writing , but insisted he was the identical Person , whose Name was to the Note ; and said , that he was known very well to be so ; upon this he was committed for further Examination ; and he afterwards acknowledged his Name was J - W - , but it appearing to the Jury , that the Note was credited by the Prisoner 's Brother , and ordered to be paid by him ; and the Intention of defrauding Mr Wayne , not sufficiently appearing , the Jury Acquitted him . 482 . + Elizabeth Shudrick , of Harefield , single Woman , was indicted , for that she , on the 28th of August , in the 17th Year of his present Majesty , being big with a Female Child ; on the said 28th of August , she , the said Female Child , by the Providence of God , privately and secretly , did bring forth alive , which said Female Child , by the Laws of this Land is a Bastard ; and that she , the said Elizabeth Shudrick , not having God before her Eyes , & c. afterwards , to wit , on the said 28th of August , the said Female Bastard Child , feloniously , wilfully , and of her Malice aforethought , in both her Hands did take , the said Child being alive , her Hands about the Neck of the said Child being fixed , she , the said Elizabeth Shudrick , the said Child did choak , and strangle , by Means of which choaking and strangling , the said Child instantly died ; and that she , the said Elizabeth Shudrick , the said Female Bastard Child did kill and murder . She was a second Time charged on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Joseph Ives . The Neighbours knowing that the Prisoner had a Child ; and the Child not being to be found , they thought she had made away with it ; so we took her up ; and then , she owned , that she had the Child dead in the House ; she would have had the Neighbours have gone to have seen it , but they were afraid to go after the Child was dead - I believe the Child had been dead about a Fortnight ; she had buried the Child under the Bed ; it had been buried a Fortnight before any Body knew of it - she had scratched a Hole , and put the Child into it - it is an earthen Floor - she pulled it out from under the Bed . John Warren . ( The Constable ) I was ordered by the Church-Warden to take the Prisoner up , which I did , and carried her to Uxbridge ; when she was examined about it ; she said , she had the Child at Home ; and that it was on the off Side of the Bed ; I went with her Home , and she took the Child out . Q . Was the Child put in the Ground ? Warren . Not in the Ground that I saw ; she pulled the Child out from behind the Bed ; I never saw the Child alive - it had been dead a Fortnight . Q . Did you see any Marks of Violence upon the Child ? Warren . I did not see any Marks of Violence ; there could be no Marks of Violence to be seen , it had been dead so long . Elizabeth Christwood . The Prisoner has had a Child lately , I can not say how long since - I believe about five or six Weeks ago . Q How do you know she has had a Child lately ? Christwood . She looked as if she was with Child , and I do suppose she had a Child ; after she had been at Uxbridge , she owned it , but not before ; she said , she had put it on the off Side of her Bed ; I saw the Child after it was found - I did not make any Observations on the Body - I did not see any Marks of Violence . Jury . Did the Prisoner say the Child died a natural Death , or what did she say ? Christwood She did not say any Thing about that . Q . Was it at its full Growth ? Christwood . I do not know . Q . During the Time she was with Child , did she say she was with Child ? Christwood I never heard her say she was - she was not a Servant ; she lived with her Mother , a Widow Woman , at Harefield . Sarah Webster . I know the Prisoner had a Child about five or six Weeks ago ; the Child was carried to Uxbridge before the Justices , and brought Home again and buried ; I saw it after it was carried to Uxbridge - I knew she was with Child before she was delivered ; I have taxed her with it , but she denied it . William Mellish . ( Surgeon ) I was called before the Bench of Justices at Uxbridge , the Day the Prisoner was before them ; and I saw her , with the Child in her Lap ; it was a Female Child - it had been dead about a Fortnight ; it smelt very strong . Q . Was the Child at its full Growth ? Mellish . Yes , my Lord , she had gone her full Time . Q . Were there any Marks of Violence upon the Child ? Mellish . The Head appeared black and livid , the Face looked as if some Body had sat their Feet upon it , or sat down upon it ; the Nose was flat . Q . Can you tell whether you can be at any Certainty whether the Child was born dead or alive ? Mellish . I can not be certain of that ; there is an Experiment to be made , by taking out the Lungs , and putting them into Water , to see whether they will sink or swim ; but I apprehend the Lungs of this Child were so putrified , that it would not have been a just Trial . Prisoner . I am very ignorant of the Matter ; here is the Childbed-Linnen , that I had provided for the Child . Mellish . She did produce such a Parcel of Childbed-Linnen as those are , before the Bench of Justices . Jury . Is her Mother living ? Prisoner . My Mother is living , but she is not here . Q . Ca n't you show that you did not conceal the Death of this Child ? * * Tis thought Cases of this Kind would not so frequently occur at the Old-Bailey , if the Law were more generally known , viz . 21 Jac . I. c. 27 . '' Whereas many lewd Women that have been delivered of `` Bastard Children , to avoid their Shame , and to escape Punishment , do secretly bury , or conceal the `` Death of their Child , and after , if the Child be found dead , the said Women do alledge that the said `` Child was born dead ; whereas it falleth out sometimes , although hardly it is to be proved , that the `` said Child or Children were murdered by the said Women , their lewd Mothers , or by their Assent , `` or Procurement. `` For the preventing therefore of this great Mischief , Be it Enacted by the Authority of this present `` Parliament , That if any Woman , after one Month next ensuing the End of this Session of Parliament , `` be delivered of any Issue of her Body , Male or Female , which being born alive , should by the Laws `` of this Realm be a Bastard , and that she endeavour privately , either by drowning , or secret burying `` thereof , or any other Way , either by herself , or the procuring of others , so to conceal the Death thereof , `` as that it may not come to light , whether it were born alive , or not , but he concealed : In `` such Case , the said Mother so offending , shall suffer Death as in the Case of Murder , except such `` Mother can make Proof by one Witness at the least , that the Child , ( whose Death was by her so intended `` to be concealed ) was born dead . '' Prisoner . No body was with me when the Child was born ; it was in the Night in my Mother 's House , but she was not at Home . Elizabeth Christwood . The Prisoner has a Child of five Years old last Valentine's-Day , and no Woman could ever be fonder of a Child than she is of that ; this Childbed-Linnen was prepared beforehand , and was shown before the Justices .

Then tell me whether or no , ( I am sure I will do fairly , God forbid that I should do otherwise ) Mr Chetwynd did not refuse to give any of the Cake to Mr Ricketts ? Hamilton . Yes , he did use it . Counc . Who did he cut the Cake for ? Was it not for himself ? Hamilton . I believe it was . Counc . Then he did not cut it for any body else ; I think you told , he laughingly told the Maid he had got it ? Hamilton . Yes . Counc . And upon that , Mr Chetwynd demanded it from him again , and he laughed , but did not deliver it . Hamilton . He made him no Answer , but did not deliver it . Counc . Did he ask him to give it him again before this unhappy Accident happened ? Hamilton . Yes , he did . Counc . Pray tell me whether he did not besides his Laughing , endeavour to keep the Cake from him ? Hamilton . I did not observe that . Counc . Please to tell me , whether as you were School fellows together ; you were not all good Friends ? Hamilton . Yes , we were . Counc . Which of the two was biggest . Hamilton . Ricketts was larger than Chetwynd . Counc . I am obliged to the Gentlemen on the other Side , for intiating that Mr Chetwynd gave Mr Ricketts a Piece of Cake before , I would ask you whether Mr Chetwynd did not give Mr Ricketts a Piece that Morning ? Hamilton . I heard he did . Counc . How long was that before this Thing happened ? Hamilton . I do n't know how long it was . This happen 'd about One o'Clock . Counc . When this unfortunate Thing happened what did Mr Chetwynd say immediately upon it ? Hamilton . Really , I do not know . Counc . I think , Sir , you were telling the Court of a French Knife ; I own I do n't know what they are ; but the Question I would ask you , is , whether most of you young Gentlemen do not carry these Knives in your Pockets ? Hamilton . I have heard so ; it was a Knife that he always had . Counc . And I suppose many of you had such Knives ? Hamilton . I can not tell , as to that , Sir . Counc . I am obliged to you for the Candour you have used in your Evidence I have no more Questions to ask you . Court . Can you recollect , how these young Gentlemen lived together , whether there was any Will between them , or whether they lived in friendly Manner ? Hamilton . I think they lived as the other Scholars did . Court . Do you apprehend there was any Malice between them ? Hamilton . I never knew of any Malice between them . Court . How did the young Gentleman behave after he had given that Wound ? Hamilton . I did not see him afterwards . [ Master Samuel Malcher , sworn . ] Court . How old are you ? Malcher . I am thirteen next January ? The Court asked Malcher what he thought would become of him , if he did not speak the Truth ; to which , he replied , he should be unhappy everlasting . Counc . Were you present at this unhappy Affair ? Malcher . Yes . Counc . Then give us an Account of what you heard , and what you saw ? Malcher . Mr Ricketts asked Mr Chetwynd for a Piece of his Cake , and Mr Chetwynd gave him a Piece ; he asked him for another Piece , and he refused it him . Counc .

It was about a Quarter of an Hour ; and after he had refused it him , he went out of the Room , with the Cake under his Arm , and then came into the Room again . Counc . What Room was it ? Malcher . It was the Room where Mr Chetwynd lay . Counc . What Room did he go into , when he went out of his own Room , after his refusing him the Cake ? Malcher . He did not go into any Room ; he only went out of the Room to the Head of the Stair-Case , and then came in again . Counc . Did he open the Bureau then , or was it open before ? Malcher . I can not justly recollect that . Counc . You say he had the Cake with him ? Malcher . Yes . Counc . What did he cut it upon ? Malcher . He cut it upon the Bureau . Counc . You say he cut a Piece , what did he do with it ? Malcher . He laid it down upon the Bureau , and Ricketts came and took it - snatched it away . Counc . Did Chetwynd see him take it away ? Malcher .

Counc . In how long Time was that after he took the Cake ? Malcher . I believe it was a Minute . Counc . Was it so long as a Minute ? Malcher . I do not know whether it was quite so long as a Minute , or not , it was but a very little Time . Counc . Did Chetwynd ask for his Cake ? Malcher . I was not near enough to hear it ; I was at my Box , at the other End of the Room . Counc . Is it a small Room ? Malcher . It is not a very large Room ? Counc . What happened after that ? Malcher .

You was present at the Beginning of this Transaction , was you not ? Malcher . Yes . Counc . Was you present before Mr Hamilton came up ? Malcher . Yes , Sir . Counc . When Mr Ricketts had the Piece of Cake given him , that was before Mr Hamilton came up , was it not ? Malcher . Mr Hamilton did not see him give it him . Counc . They were good Friends before this , were they not ? Malcher . I think so , they used to be so . Counc . When Ricketts asked him for the second Piece of Cake , was not he teazing of him ? Malcher . No , he teazed him about the first ; and then he went out of the Room , and Ricketts followed him . Counc . You say , Mr. Chetwynd carried the Cake under his Arm out of the Room , and Ricketts followed him ; and then Chetwynd came into the Room again , and Ricketts followed him still , did not he ? Malcher . Yes . Counc . Then he came to his Bureau , Ricketts following of him still ? Malcher . Yes ; and then I saw Mr Ricketts take the Piece of Cake up , which Mr Chetwynd had laid upon his Bureau . Counc . Then Mr Chetwynd turned about to ask for his Cake again ? Malcher . I did not hear him ask for it . Counc . He went after him , did not he ? Malcher . Yes . Counc . Was it not for his Cake ? Malcher . I can not tell . Counc . Did Ricketts shove him ? Malcher .

Counc . What did Chetwynd say then ? Malcher . Chetwynd said , he had a Knife of his own . Counc . Pray , had Ricketts a Knife in his Hand ? Malcher . Yes , he had a Knife , and offered to lend it Mr Chetwynd . Pros . Counc . I should be glad to know whether he did not put that Knife into his Pocket again ? Malcher . I do not know that he did . Counc . Here is a Question misunderstood I believe , did the Knife that you speak of belong to Mr Chetwynd , or to Mr Ricketts ? Malcher . The Knife belonged to Mr Ricketts . Pris . Counc . That 's a fair Answer to the Question . Court . Ricketts 's Knife was opened before Chetwynd 's ; were both the Knives open at the Time this unhappy Accident happened ? Malcher . Mr Chetwynd 's Knife was not opened when Mr Ricketts offered him his Knife ; but he refused it , and said he had one of his own . Court . Was Rickett 's Knife open then ? Malcher . Yes . Court . Were they both open when the Accident happend ? Malcher . No .

Was it before the Cake was cut and laid upon the Bureau ? Malcher . Yes , it was . [ Hannah Humphreys sworn . ] Counc . Pray give us an Account what you know of this unhappy Affair . Humphreys . The young Gentlemen were in the Dining-Room , and I was in the next Room ; I heard a Noise , upon which I went into the Dining-Room and asked them what they did there , and what was the Matter they were not in their own Rooms ; Mr Ricketts made Answer , that he wanted a Piece of Cake of Mr Chetwynd ; I said to Mr. Ricketts , have not you had a Piece ; he said No , and smiled . I looked at Mr. Ricketts , and said , I believed he had had some , for he had some Crumbs of Cake upon his Lips ; Mr Ricketts smiled again , and said , he wanted another Piece , or a bigger Piece . Counc . Where was Mr Chetwynd then ? Humphreys . Mr Chetwynd at that Time was at his own Bureau , cutting his Cake . Counc . How far was Mr Ricketts off the Bureau ? Humphreys . He was as near as I can guess about two Yards from the Bureau ; Mr Ricketts went up to the Bureau to Mr Chetwynd , and Mr Chetwynd lifts up his Arms , and says , Do n't Mr Ricketts , and Mr Ricketts then took the Cake . Court . Mention in what Manner he took it . Humphreys . I think , to the best of my Knowledge it was over Mr Chetwynd 's Shoulder . Counc . Where did you stand at that Time ? Humphreys . I stood at the Corner of the middle Window , and Mr Ricketts almost faced me , not quite , but was a little Sideways of me . Court . Had Mr Ricketts the Cake in his Hand ? Humphreys . He had the Cake in his Hand . Court . How far were you off the Bureau then ? Humphreys . I was then from the Bureau about three Yards , and Mr Ricketts came up to me , and said , Hannah , I have got some Cake . ( I had a Stocking in my Hand which I was darning . ) Upon , Mr Ricketts 's saying he had got some Cake , Mr Chetwynd came from his Bureau , to my Right-Hand , and in a very short Time Mr. Ricketts said , Hannah , Mr Chetwynd has stabbed me . I looked at him . Pros . Counc . Did you see Mr Chetwynd come from the Bureau ? Humphreys . Yes Counc . Where did Mr. Ricketts stand ? Humphreys . Mr Ricketts stood just by me . Counc . Now tell us whether you saw this Stab given ? Humphreys . I did not see it given . Counc . Did you observe that Mr Ricketts had any Thing in his Hand ? Humphreys . He had nothing in his Hand but a Bit of Cake . Counc . Did you observe that Mr Ricketts had struck Mr Chetwynd ? Humphreys . No , he had not struck him , and was not seemingly in any Anger . Counc . You say that at this Time Mr Chetwynd came up and stabbed Mr Ricketts . Pris . Counc . No , that is not right . Court . She said Mr. Ricketts told her so . Pris . Counc . I do n't doubt your Candour , but you are mistaken in the Evidence ; repeat it again . Humphreys . I saw Mr. Ricketts come from the Scrutore , and he said , Mr. Chetwynd has stabbed me . Says I , Mr Ricketts you joke ; Mr Ricketts had put his Hand to his Side : I bid him take his Hand away , and then I saw a little Blood ; Mr Chetwynd , said I , You have done very well ; Mr Chetwynd said , Hannah , if I have hurt him , I am sorry for it . Pros . Counc . Did you observe who were in the Room ? Humphreys . I saw Mr. Hamilton , Mr. Ricketts , and Mr. Chetwynd . Court . Did you hear Chetwynd ask Ricketts for his Piece of Cake ? Humphreys . I did not hear him . Counc . What became of Mr Chetwynd after that ? where did he go ? Humphreys . He went out of the Room . Counc . How long did he continue in the House ? Humphreys . He continued in the House till Tuesday Morning . Counc . That was the next Morning ; did he give any Notice of his going away ? Humphreys . I can not tell that . [ Council for the Prisoner on the Cross Examination . ] Counc . Tell us where this Room was , where you heard the Noise before you went to them ? Humphreys . It was on the same Floor . Counc . Did you hear any rustling of Feet , or only their Tongues ? Humphreys . It was only their Tongues ; it is my customary Way when I hear any Noise among the young Gentlemen to go to them , in order to persuade them to be quite . Counc . Where was Mr Chetwynd when you came into the Room ? Humphreys . Mr Chetwynd was at his Bureau , and Mr Ricketts was standing in the Room , and he said he wanted a Piece of Cake of Mr Chetwynd . Counc . Was this Mr Ricketts 's Room ? Humphreys . No , Mr Ricketts had a Room up another Pair of Stairs . Counc . Then he was got into Mr Chetwynd 's Room , which was the Occasion of your asking him what he did there ? Humphreys . Yes . 'T was the Room where Mr Chetwynd lay ; he had not a Room to himself . Counc . Was there any Conversation about the Cake , or any asking for Cake before you went into the Room ? Humphreys . I do n't know , he only said he wanted another Piece of Mr Chetwynd 's Cake . Counc . Was Mr Chetwynd 's Back toward you ? Humphreys . Yes . Counc . Then consequently it must be so to Mr Ricketts ? Humphreys . Yes . - Mr Chetwynd put out his Arms a little to keep Ricketts from the Cake . It was but a very little way thus , extending his Arms a little from his Body , and raising them up , and Mr Chetwynd said , Do n't Mr Ricketts . Counc . Did you observe Mr Ricketts then offer to take the Cake , or to touch Mr Chetwynd ? Humphreys . I only observed him to take the Cake . Counc . But did you see him touch him ? Humphreys . I did not see him touch him . Counc . That is very odd , because putting out his Arm , and saying do n't shews as if he had done something ? Humphreys . He might touch his Cloaths , when he took away the Cake . Counc . Was not he taller than Mr Chetwynd ? Humphreys . He was a great deal taller than Mr Chetwynd , he might for his Heighth reach over Mr Chetwynd , and take the Cake . Counc . Could he take it over his Shoulder , or over his Head without touching him ? Humphreys . Over his Shoulder he might do it without touching him . Counc . Did he take the Cake over his Shoulder or over his Head ? Humphreys . I think it was over his Shoulder . Counc . Did not Mr Ricketts laugh when he had got the Cake ? Humphreys . Mr Ricketts came away laughing , and said he had got a Bit more Cake . Counc . Was there any Motion or Action between them before this Thing happened . Humphreys . There was not any Motion or Action at all that I saw before this happened . Counc . Did you stand facing the Bureau ? Humphreys . The Bureau was behind my Back , and Mr Ricketts stood facing me , as I stood Side-ways to the Window , with my Work in my Hand , and Mr Chetwynd was by my Right Hand , we all three in a manner touched one another . Counc . How could this be done without your seeing it ? Humphreys . I did not see it done . Counc . And then the first Thing you heard was , that he was stabbed ? Humphreys . That was what Mr Ricketts said . Counc . And you at that Time did not believe it ? Humphreys . No , I did not believe it ; for when Mr Ricketts said he was stabbed , I lifted my Eyes off my Work , and said , Mr Ricketts , you joke ? Counc . Was there any Blow given ? Humphreys . I believe there was no Blow ; I did not see any ; I did not at first believe that there was a Wound . Counc . As you did not believe it , it is plain that Mr Chetwynd did not believe it ; for , he said , if I have hurt Mr Ricketts , I am sorry for it . Did he look to have Anger in his Countenance ? Humphreys . No ; he looked with Concern ; and said , Hannah , If I have hurt Mr Ricketts I am sorry for it . [ Mr Beaston Long sworn . ] Prosecutor 's Council . Pray , Mr Long , inform the Court what Discourse passed between you and the Deceased , after he had received the Wound ? Mr Long . I came to Town on Monday Night , the 26th of September , and found a Letter from Mr Clare ; wherein he acquainted me , that Mr Ricketts had met with an untoward Accident , and had received a Wound from a young Gentleman in the House , but that he thought there was then no Danger ; this Letter having been wrote in the Morning , I enquired if there had been any subsequent Message from Mr Clare ; I was told there had not ; I did not go to Mr Ricketts that Night , not thinking there was any Occasion for so doing ; but , in the Morning , I determin 'd to take the Advice of Mr St Hill , who being a Gentleman very emiment in his Profession , we always take his Opinion , when any Accident happens to the young Gentleman under our Care ; I wrote a Letter to him , and desired he would meet me at the Academy that Day [ that was on Tuesday ] which he did ; and I found there Mr Shipton and Mr Middleton , who had likewise been called in ; these three Gentlemen , with Mr Mccullock , the Surgeon of the House , viewed Mr Ricketts 's Wound , and thought him in very great Danger ; they continued attending him till Thursday Morning the 29th , when he died . Counc . What Account did Mr Ricketts give you of the Occasion of this Accident ? Mr Long . Mr Ricketts told me , that on the Monday , about Noon , he was sent to call Mr Chetwynd to sence , and found him in the Dining-Room , with a Cake , of which he asked him for a Piece , which he gave him ; that he then asked Mr Chetwynd for another Piece , which he refused ; and cut a Piece of the Cake , and laid it upon his Bureau , which stood at the End of the Room ; Mr Ricketts , to teaze Mr Chetwynd , for having refused him , ( but without any Intention of eating or keeping it ) took up the Piece of Cake , carried it to the middle Window , and said to a Maid , who stood there , Hannah , I have got a Piece of Cake ; and , he said , that Mr Chetwynd followed him , and immediately stabbed him in the Belly . Prisoner 's Council . You said , you came to Town that Monday , did you see Mr Ricketts that Day ? Long . I came to Town that Monday Night , and found a Letter from Mr Clare ; I did not see Mr Ricketts that Day ; for I did not apprehend there was so much Danger , as I afterwards found there was . Counc . How many Surgeons had you ? Long . There were four Surgeons ; three were called in ; and there was Mr Mccullock ; the Surgeon of the House . Counc . I should be glad to know whether Mr Ricketts gave any Account to you of any Passage that happened immediately after the taking of the Cake ? Long . He said , that after he had taken the Piece of Cake , he carried it to the middle Window , where the Maid stood ; and said , Hannah , I have got a Piece of Cake ; and that Mr Chetwynd came up to him , and stabbed him without speaking a Word . Counc . Without whose speaking a Word ? Long . Without Mr Chetwynd 's speaking a Word . Counc . Did you ask him in what Manner he had lived with this young Gentleman the Prisoner , whether they did not live in Friendship ? Long . He said , he never had had any Quarrel with him ; and I have Reason to think it to be true , because , Mr Ricketts was a Lad of a remarkably good-natured Disposition . Counc . Did you ask him any thing farther ? Long . Mr Ricketts was generally , when I saw him , in such extreme Torment , that I did not care to trouble him with too many Questions . Counc . Did not he tell you he forgave him ? Long . He did say that he forgave him . Prosecutor 's Council . Call Mr St Hill ? Prisoner 's Council . There is no Occasion for it . Prosecutor 's Council . The Jury must have Satisfaction , that the Wound was the Occasion of his Death . [ Mr Peter St Hill , sworn ] Counc . Pray , Sir , give the Court an Account in what Condition you found the Deceased ? Mr St Hill . On Tuesday the 27th of last Month I received a Letter from Mess . Drake and Long , desiring me to go to Mr Clare 's Academy in Soho-Square , to see a young Gentleman , that they had the Care of , who the Day before had been accidentally wounded : I met there Mr Shipton , Mr Middleton , and Mr Mccullock ; and by Mr Mccullock 's Account of the Wound , who first dressed him , and the Symptoms that attended it , we had too much Reason to fear , that it had penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly , and that some of the Viscera were wounded ; for his Belly was much swell 'd ; and cross the upper Part of it so very painful , as to deprive him of all rest , and his Pulse were extreamly quick , and contracted . The next Day we met again - He had had a very unquiet Night ; his Pulse were extreamly quick and low ; and though his Belly was not so much swell 'd , yet his Pain cross the upper Part of it was more severe , and attended with a continual Hickup , and frequent bilious Vomitings . Counc . Pray , Sir , inform us , whether you think that Wound was the Occasion of his Death ? What Depth was the Wound of ? Mr St Hill . It is not easy to know the Depth of a Wound , after it has penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly : But , upon the whole , I think we have given our Opinion , in such a Manner , that nobody will doubt , but that the Wound was the Occasion of his Death . Counc . Then you do think that Wound to be the Occasion of his Death ? Mr St Hill . I do think it to be the Occasion of his Death . Counc . In what Part was the Wound given ? Mr St Hill . It was on the Right side of the Belly , two Inches obliquely below the Navel . [ A Piece of the Blade of the Knife was produced , which was about three Inches long , and sharp at the Point . ] Council to Humphreys . Did you see the Knife in Mr Chetwynd 's Hand ? Humphreys . Yes . Counc . What kind of a Knife was it ? Humphreys . It was a Knife with a long Handle . Counc . Was it a long Blade ? Humphreys . It was such a Blade as this ; this is but a Piece of it . Counc . It is a French Couteau . Prisoner 's Council . It is no such Thing , it is only a common French Knife . [ Mr Peter Mccullock , sworn . ] Council . Mr Mccullock , pray , give an Account how you found the Deceased ? Mr Mccullock . I was called at half an Hour after One , on the Monday , to go to Mr Clare 's ; when I came there , I asked to see the Knife , and the Knife was produced Counc . Was it produced broke ? Mccullock . Yes , it was produced to me then broke , as it is now , I probed the Wound ; but did not find , at that Time , that it had penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly ; the Deceased 's Pulse were extreamly low , but I thought that was owing to the Fright : I went the next Day ; and then upon searching the Wound , I found it had penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly , and found it to be a very bad Case ; upon that Mr Middleton was sent for ; and after that Mr St Hill , and Mr Shipton . THE COUNCIL for the Prisoner called no Witnesses , admitting that the Fact had been fairly laid before the Court by the Evidence , and acknowledged the Candour of the Gentlemen concerned for the Prosecution , in representing it to the Jury without any Aggravation : but insisted , on his Behalf , that however his Hand might have been unhappy his Heart was innocent ; that this Fact therefore could not amount to Murther at Common-Law , which the Lord Coke defines to be An unlawful killing another with Malice aforethought , either expressed by the Party or implied by the Law ; that , in this Case , there was not the least of that Ingredient , their own Evidence having shewed they were Friends , Friends to the last Hour , Friends to the dying Hour ; when the Gentleman said , he forgave him . That it being proved there was a Friendship subsisting , it would be talking against the Sense of Mankind , to say the Law could imply any thing contrary to what is plainly proved . That Deliberation and a Cruelty of Disposition make the Difference between Manslaughter and Murther . For which Purpose Holloway 's * Case was cited . * Vide Appendix , No 1 . If A be passing the Street , and B meeting him , takes the Wall of A , and thereupon A kills him , this is Murther ; but if B had justled A , this justling had been a Provocation , and would have made it Manslaughter , 1 Hale 's Hist . Pl . Cr . 455 . If I see another 's Child beat , or Wife debauch 'd , it would be Murther in me to kill the Party , not so in the Parent or Husband . A sudden Challenge and fighting immediately , the Challenge is held to be a sufficient Provocation . The Law makes a Difference between a Person 's killing another , when he is doing a lawful Act , and when he is doing an unlawful Act . If the Master designeth moderate Correction to his Servant and accordingly useth it , and the Servant by some Misfortune dieth thereof , this is not Murther , but per infortunium ; because the Law alloweth him to use moderate Correction and therefore the deliborate Purpose thereof is not ex malitia ; But if the Master design an immoderate or unreasonable Correction , either in respect of the Measure , or Manner , or Instrument thereof , and the Servant die thereof ; if it be done Easily , and without De-liberation , this would be Manslaughter ; if done with Deliberation and Design it would be Murther , L. C. J . Hale in his Hist . Pl . Coron . p. 454 . Shall the young Boy at the Bar , who was doing a lawful Act , be said to be guilty of Murther ; he was rescuing what was his own ; the Witnesses have told you , that after he had given the poor Boy Ricketts a Piece of Cake , Ricketts went to him for more ; he denied it him ; he had a Right to keep his Cake , the other had no Right to take it ; and he had a Right to retake it . There are Cases in the Books which make a Difference between Murther and Manslaughter : If a Man takes * up a Bar of Iron and throws at another it is Murther ; and the Difference in the Crime lies between a Person 's taking it up , and having it in his Hand ; Chetwynd had the Knife in his Hand , and upon that a Provocation ensues , for he did not take the Knife up ; if he had , that might have shewn an Intention to do Mischief . It may be doubted , whether or no , when he had this Knife in his Hand for a lawful Purpose , and in an Instant struck the other , whether he considered he had the Knife in his Hand ; for if , in his Passion , he intended to strike with his Hand , and struck with the Knife , not thinking it was in his Hand , it is not a striking with the Knife . * Vide Appendix , No . VI . That in respect to the Statute of the first of James I . + it had always been looked upon as a hard Law , and construed therefore constantly very strictly by all the Judges in favour of the Prisoner . That when the Facts amount only to Manslaughter at Common-Law , it has been the Custom of the Courts ++ to acquit upon this Statute . + Vide Appendix , No . II . ++ At a Meeting of all the Judges , on Saturday the 28th of April , 1666 , at Serjeants-Inn , to consider of such Things as might in Point of Law fall out in the Trial of the Lord Morley , who was on Monday to be tried by his Peers for a Murther ; they were all of Opinion , that the Statute of 1 Jac . for stabbing a Man not having first struck , nor having any Weapon drawn , was only a Declaration of the Common-Law , and made to prevent the Inconveniencies of Juries , who were apt to believe that to be a Provocation to extennate a Murther , which in Law was not . Kelyng 55 . That this Act was made for a particular Purpose || : On the Union of the two Kingdoms , there were national Factions and Jealousies , when wicked Persons to conceal the Malice lurking in their Hearts , would suddenly stab others , and screen themselves from the Law , by having the Act looked upon as the Result of an immediate Quarrel . || This Statute was enacted in the Time of King James the First , when many Animosities arose between the English and the Scotch , who using Daggers were accustomed to stab many of the English , ex improviso , which could not have been done by a flat Sword , the usual Weapon of the English ; therefore this Statute was designed to secure defenceless People from Surprize , supposing that whoever struck would be prepared . Rex v. Keite . Lord Raymond 139 . That it was to be considered , whether there was not Evidence to except this Case from the Letter of the Law : At the Beginning of the Fray Ricketts had a Knife in his Hand ; and it was one continued Act . And another Question was , whether there was not a Struggle ; here was the Cake taken , and in endeavouring to get it again this Accident happens ; on the first taking of the Cake , it is in Evidence , that Chetwynd was forced to extend his Arms to keep the other off ; now there was no Occasion for him to extend his Arms , unless the other was coming to take it from him ; and then a Struggle is a Blow . In Reneer 's Case , ( cited in the King and Keite Cymbal gave no Stroke but in struggling , and yet it was adjudged but Manslaughter in Reneer L. Raymond 143 . If a Man hath done a Trespass , and is not continuing in it , and he that hath received the Injury shall thereupon beat him to a Degree of killing , this , faith the Lord Chief Justice Holt ( Kelyug 132 ) is Murther : but this Act of the Deceased is a Trespass , and the not restoring what he had taken was a continuing in the Trespass , and is such a Provocation as will make it Manslaughter at Common-Law . That this Statute is not to be literally interpreted , for taking up a Candlestick to throw at another has been judged a Weapon drawn ~ . ~ See Page 316 . Col. 1 3 . Meer stabbing is not within the Act ; when a Man is taken in Adultery with another Man 's Wife , if the Husband shall stab the Adulterer , or knock out his Brains , this is bare Manslaughter . 1 Vent . 158 . Raymond 213 . Kelyug 137 . A Man must intend to kill to be within the Statute ; and must intend to stab , for throwing a Hammer is not within the Act . Williams 's * Case cited in Kelyng 131 . * Vide Appendix , No . III . That some Degree of Malice is + required in this Case , as well as at Common-Law . The Act indeed has taken away the Necessity of the Proof of Malice , and laid the Negative upon the Criminal , and here the Negative is proved . The Intent of the Statute was to take away the Benefit of the Clergy from cruel and bloody minded People ; 't is impossible to conceive , that the Parliament should , at all Events , condemn to Death those who had no preconceived Malice . + Vide p. 316 . Col. 2 . & . 3 . But the Case most strongly insisted and relied on in behalf of the Prisoner , was Buckner 's ++ Case on the Statute , wherein the Judges all agreed , because there was some Provocation and no preconceived Malice , that he was not within the Act of Parliament . ++ Vide Appendix , No . IV . THE COUNCIL for the Crown , in Reply to the Arguments and Cases insisted upon on behalf of the Prisoner , submitted to the Court , whether ( since the only Points insisted upon by way of Defence for the Prisoner , were Questions of Law , in which the Jury were to be guided by their Opinion ) the Facts proved and admitted , did not clearly , in the first Place , amount to Murther at Common-Law ; and in the second Place , whether there could he the least Doubt in Point of Law , but that this Case was within the Statute of 1 James 1 8 . Upon the first it was admitted , that to constitute Murther there must be Malice . But it was argued , that Malice was of two Kinds ; either express and in fact , or implied by Law That when one Person kills another without Provocation it is Murtuer || , because the Law presumes and implies Malice from the Act done . || He that doth a cruel Act voluntarily , doth it of Malice prepensed , 3 . Inst . 62 . Some have been led into Mistake , by not well considering what the Passion of Malice is ; they have construed it to be a Ranmour of Mind lodged in the Person killing , for some considerable Time before the Commission of the Fact , which is a Mistake arising from the not well distinguishing between Hatred and Malice . Envy , Hatred , and Malice , are three distinct Passions of the Mind . Lord Chief Justice Holt in Mawgridge 's Case , Relying 126 . And therefore , wherever any Person kills another it is Murther , unless some sufficient Provocation appear . But that it is not every Provocation which extenuates the killing of a Man from Murther to Manslaughter . A slight or trivial Provocation is the same as none , and is not allowed by Law to be any Justification or Excuse for the Death of another . And therefore no Words of Reproach or Infamy , whatever provoking Circumstances they may be attended with ; no affronting Gestures or deriding Postures , however insolent or malicious , are allowed to be put in the Balance with the Life of a Man , and to extenuate the Offence from Murther to Manslaughter . Kelyng 130 . Croke El . 779 . ~ ~ See this latter Case at large Appendix , No . V. For the same Reason , no sudden Quarrel upon a slight Provocation shall justify such an act of Cruelty as one Man 's stabbing another , though it is done immediately in the Heat of Passion . As if two Persons , playing at Tables , fall out in their Game , and the one upon the sudden kills another with a Dagger ; this was held to be Murther by Bromley 27 Eliz . at Chester Assizes . Crompton 's Justice 23 . Kelyng 128 . In like manner , no Trespass on Lands or Goods shall be allowed by Law to be any Excuse for one Man 's attacking another in such a Manner as apparently endangers his Life , and could not be intended merely as a Chastisement for his Offence ; because no violent Acts beyond the Proportion of the Provocation receive Countenance from the Law . And therefore if a Man beats another that is trespassing upon his Goods or Lands , and does not de , he will be justified by Law ; because what he does is only in Defence of his Property , and no more than a Chastisement to an Offender . But ( says the Lord Chief Justice Holt ) if one Man be trespassing upon another , breaking his Hedges , or the like ; and the Owner , or his Servant , shall upon Sight thereof , take up an Hedge Stake , and knock him on the Head , that will be Murther because it is a violent Act , beyond the Proportion of the Provocation . Kelyng 132 . That applying the Rules of Law to the present Case , it was plain , that the violent Act done , bore no Proportion to the Provocation . All the Provocation given was taking up a Piece of Cake , which is not such an Offence , as can justify the Prisoner 's attacking the Person , who took it up , with an Instrument , that apparently endangered his Life , or rather carried certain Death along with it . And lastly , that Gray 's Case + ( Kelyng 64 , and 133 ) was much stronger than the present : Where a Master , who was provoked with the Neglect , Disobedience , and Insolence of his Apprentice , and had therefore a Right by Law to chatlise him ; immediately upon receiving the Provocation , took up a Bar of Iron , at which he was then working , and struck his Apprentice , who afterwards died of the Blow . This was by all the Judges held to be Murther , notwithstanding it was done upon a sudden , and notwithstanding the Provocation , and the Right which Grey had as a Master , to correct his Servant . For having exceeded Measure herein , what he did was malicious . + Vide Appendix , No . VI . Upon the second Indictment it was said , that the Gentlemen who had argued on behalf of the Prisoner , had , in order to raise a Doubt upon this Point , in Effect contended that the Statute of James I , should never be allowed to comprehend any one Case whatsoever , or extend to any one Offender . For if Persons indicted upon that Statute , were to be acquitted wherever the Case would have been Manslaughter at Common-Law , the Statute would be entirely frustrated , and have no Kind of Effect whatsoever . Since it was only made in order to exclude such Persons as stabbed others upon the sudden , not upon their Guard , from the Benefit of Clergy ; and was intended as a sort of Correction to the Common-Law , by restraining such Offenders , thro ' Fear of due Punishment . who were emboldened by presuming on the Benefit of Clergy , allowed by the Common-Law . But if it is to exclude none from their Clergy , who at Common-Law would have been entitled to it , it can never have any Effect , and may as well be repealed . That whatever the Reasons might be which such gave Rise to this Statute , the Legislature thought it of general publick Benefit , and therefore afterwards continued it by a subsequent Law . And , if the Statute is to have any Force or Effect at all , there ca n't be a Doubt but that is must extend to the present Case . It is expressly within the Words ; Mr. Ricketts , was stabbed , having then no Weapon drawn in his Hand , and not having before struck the Person who stabbed him . It is plainly within the Intention ; which is declared in the Preamble to have been in order to punish stabbing , or killing upon the sudden , committed in Rage , or any other Passion of the Mind , & c. And the principal Reasons upon which the Determination in Buckner 's Case is founded , conclude strongly against the Prisoner . For it is there arga 'd , that Buckner was not with in the Statute , because it appeared to have be made to prevent sudden killing , the worst of a killing , of a Person not upon his Guard . And secondly , because in that Case the Party slain might have foreseen the Danger , and defended himself . But the unfortunate Person killed in this Case , had no Opportunity either of foreseeing the Danger , or of avoiding it , or making any Defence but was killed on the sudden , before he could apprehend any Danger . And therefore it was submitted to the Court , whether upon the Facts prov 'd and not denied , the Consequence of Law was not clear that the Prisoner was guilty within both Indictments . MR BARON REYNOLDS and Mr . Recorder ( being the only Gentlemen of the long Robe on the Bench , when Mr. Chetwynd was tried taking Notice of the Points of Law that had arisen , the learned Arguments of the Council , and the many Cases cited upon this Occasion , were of Opinion , that it would be proper to have the Facts found specially , that they might be put in a way of receiving a more solemn Determination . A Special Verdict was accordingly on all Sides agreed on , and drawn up to the following Purpose , viz . The King against William Chetwynd , the same against the same , and the same against the same . We find that Thomas Ricketts , on the 26th of September last , being a Scholar at Mr Clare 's Academy , in square , was in a Room in the said Mr Clare 's House , in which the said Mr Chetwynd used to lie , ( and not Mr Ricketts ) in Company with the Prisoner William Chetwynd , William Hamilton , Samuel Malcher , and Hannah Humphreys , a Maid-Servant in the said Mr Clare 's Family ; that the said Mr Chetwynd , the Prisoner , having his own Cake in his Hand , which was a hard Cake , called a Simnel , and hard to cut , the Deceased , Thomas Ricketts , asked the said Mr Chetwynd to give him a Piece , upon which the said Mr Chetwynd gave him a Piece ; that the said Thomas Ricketts afterwards asked him , the said Chetwynd , to give him some more of his Cake , which the said Chetwynd refused , and thereupon , the said Chetwynd went out of the said Room , with his Cake under his Arm , and the Deceased followed him , out of the said Room ; upon which , the said Chetwynd returned again , into his said Room , and went to his own Bureau , and cut another Piece of the Cake for himself ; the said Ricketts offered to lend the said Chetwynd his Knife to cut the Cake , and at the same Time pulled his Knife , being a Clasped Knife , out of his Pocket , and opened it , but the said Chetwynd , refusing to make Use of the said Ricketts 's Knife , saying , he had a Knife of his own , the said Ricketts put up his Knife again , and immediately after this , the said Chetwynd being then at his Bureau , cut off a Piece of the said Cake with his own Knife , being a common Knife , and such as Mr Chetwynd , and his School Fellows generally used , and laid the same Piece of Cake upon the Top of his Bureau for himself ; that the said Chetwynd , standing then with his Back to the rest of the Company , was putting the rest of his Cake into his Bureau , and , whilst he was so doing , the Deceased came up , and put his Hand over the said Mr Chetwynd 's Shoulder , whereupon , the said Mr Chetwynd raising his Arms , said to the said Deceased , do n't Mr Ricketts , the said Mr Ricketts , immediately snatched the said Piece of Cake away , against the Consent of the said Mr Chetwynd , which lay upon the Top of the said Bureau , and went up to the said Maid-Servant , who was about two or three Yards off , and said Laughing , Hannah , I have got a Piece of Mr Chetwynd 's Cake , which he showed to her in his Hand ; that thereupon , immediately the said Mr Chetwynd followed the Deceased , with his Knife in his Hand , and demanded the said Mr Ricketts to return him his Piece of Cake , the Deceased , Mr Ricketts , re turned no Answer to this , but continued laughing , and did not return the Piece of Cake ; upon which , the said Mr Chetwynd struck the said Mr Ricketts backhanded , with the said Knife which he had kept in his Hand all along , and with which he had cut he said Cake , ( the said Ricketts being then only in his Waistcoat , which was at that Time unbuttoned ) and gave him a Wound upon the Right-side of the Belly below the Navel , which penetrated into the Cavity of the Belly , ( the Deceased not having before struck the Prisoner , and not having at that Time any Weapon in his Hand ) that immediately after , the Deceased cried out , Hannah , Chetwynd has stabbed me , and then the said Hannah , said to the Prisoner , What have you done ? Upon which the Prisoner looked on the said Hannah , with Concern , and said , If I have hurt Mr Ricketts , I am sorry for it ; We find that there never had been any Quarrel or Malice , between the Deceased an d the Prisoner , but that they constantly had lived in Friendship together . And we find likewise , that the Deceased was about the Age of Nineteen * , and Mr Chetwynd about the Age of Fifteen ; and that of this Wound the Deceased died , on the 29th of the said September ; and whether upon the whole , the Prisoner is guilty of all , or any of the several Indictments , the Jurers submit to the Judgment of the Court . * That Mr Ricketts was about Nineteen Years of Age was admitted : No Evidence being offer 'd as to the Age of the Prisoner , the Jury form 'd their Judgment thereof , on seeing him .

See summary . ] 491 . + Eleanor Scrogham , of St Margaret , Westminster , Spinster , was indicted , for that she on the 13th of September , in the 17th Year of His Majesty 's Reign , being big with two Male Children ; she on the said 13th of September , the said two Male Children , by the Providence of God , privately and secretly did bring forth alive ; which said two Male Children , by the Laws of this Land , are Bastards ; and that she the said Eleanor Scrogham , not having God , & c. on the said 13th of Sept. as soon as the said two Male Bastard Children were born , in and upon the said two Male Bastard Children , did make an Assault , and the said two Male Bastard Children , she the said Eleanor Scrogham , feloniously , wilfully , and of her Malice aforethought , in both her Hands did take , and the said two Male Bastard Children being alive , out of her Hands into a Necessary-House did cast and throw , by which casting and throwing , into the Necessary-House aforesaid , and by Reason of the Filth and Excrement therein , the said two Mare Bastard Children were suffocated ; of which Suffocation they instantly died ; and that the said Eleanor Scrogham , the said two Male Bastard Children did kill and murder . She was a second Time charged on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Diddle Webster . The Prisoner was my Servant , and she was out of Town with me at Stanmore where I lived ; she was taken ill , and said she believed she was nearer her Time than I thought for ; I sent her to Town before me . When I came to Town I found she had been Ill ; - I had taxed her with being with Child in the Country || ; she at first denied it , and then she said she was * ; and that she was married , and had three Months to go . || Mrs Webster was so affected she could scarce express herself for Tears . * The Statute 21 Jac I. c. 27 . [ inserted in the former Part , p. 277 ] doth not make a new Offence , but maketh a Concealment to be an undeniable Evidence of the Murder ; but the Party confessing herself with Child beforehand is not within the Statute , as was determined on the following Case : Ann Davis was tried at the Aug. 31 . 1664 , ( before Sir John Kelyng , Knt Lord Chief Justice of the King 's Bench , Sir Orlendo Bridg Knt . Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas , and Sir William Wyloe , Knt . and Burt Recorder of London ) for dering her Male Bastard Child . Upon the Evedence it appeared , That the Prisoner lived in a Chamber by herself , and went to Bed on Thursday Night well , without any Pain , and in the Middle of the Night ked full of Pain , and knocked some body to come to her , and one Woman heard her knock , but came not to her ; and the same Night delivered of a Child , and after she put the Child in a Trunk , and did not discover it till Friday Night following . And all this was found specially , to have the of all the Judges , Whether that knocking or Help at the Time of her Travel , ( although the conce it after one Day ) exampls her from that Statute . For there was no ary Hunt upon the Body of the Child . But thus far it was agreed by us , That if there be an Intent in the Woman to conceal the Chi ld , then it is Murder by that Statue , though Truth the Child was horn : But if there was no Intent to conceal it , or if she confess with Child before hand , and she is surprised and delivered , no body being with her , this is not within the Statute , because there was to conceal it ; and therefore in Case , if there be no Sign of Hurt upon the Child , it is no Murder . Reports , p. 32 Q . Did you know what became of the Children ? Webster . Not then I did not : I asked her where her Child was , she told me it was safe and alive , and that she had put it out ; I asked her where , she said , she had put it to Nurse at the Bull and Gate in Holborn , I enquired after it , but it was not to be found there . Q . Was there any Childbed Linnen provided ? Webster . I did not see any , I heard there was some . Q . Was not she to have gone away to have in ? Webster . I know no more than I have said . Jane Thomas . Mrs Webster sent for Afternoon about a Month ago ; said she , I , upon a Maid , brought but now she was the at the Bull and Gate in Holborn ; we went but it was not to be found . When I came back , I to Mrs Webster , I will ask Question , do you go out of the Room , and me more readily ; said I , Sweeth if the Child ; said I , I hope you have your Child ( for I had a that she had put under the Copper ) No , Madam , said she , I have not . I asked her , what she had done with it ; said I , I hope you have not murdered it ; No , Madam , said she ; said I , is the Child in the Vault , she said it was ; that she had a Desire to go to the Vault , and that it dropped from her when she was there ; we got the Vault searched , and as God would have it , the last Child came up first . I said to the Men that was searching the Vault , ( after he had taken up one Child , ) young Man , there another Child . - Upon my Oath , I said so to him ; I said to the Prisoner , are they both together ? Did you throw them down ? She said , No , indeed , I did not ; said I , are there two Children ; she said , I ca n't there was a great deal came from me , and I was in such Extreme of Pain that if I had had ten thousand Worlds , I could not got off the Vault ; and I know that when Women are in such Distress of Pain they can not stir to help themselves . Said I , if you have murdered your Children it is a crying Sin ; it is a Sin against the Holy Ghost , and if that is your Case . I should rather die than live . - I have been a Midwife 18 Years . Q . Is it usual for Women to desire to go to the Necessary House when they draw near their Time ? Thomas . Yes . - I had a Woman that I attended that stole away from me with that Intent . - I know the first Child had never been handled by any Hand to part them , because we have a particular Method that we know that by , and I believe her Pains were so violent that she could not go from the Place . I know when Women are in the Birth they can neither stand nor go . I asked her why she not call some People ; she said she thought Re she should be better . Q . Were the Children at their full Growth ? Thomas . I can not say that they were ; no Woman in England can swear to a Month in the Birth of a Child ; - she declared , before the Justice , that not made any Child-bed Linnen , but that her Sister Orders to make some , and that she there to lie in . Margaret Oldfield . I got up that Night to wash about twelve o'Clock , and I heard such a Scream that I was frightened out of my Wits ; ( I am a Servant , and live over against Mrs Webster 's said I , to the Washer-Woman , I believe Mrs Webster 's Maid is in Labour , and there is no body in the House , and if some Body does not go to her Assistance she will be lost ; ( I think it was the 13th of September ) I knocked at the Door as loud as I could knock , and called with my knocking , and she screamed out at the same Time , but did not come to the Door ; and about eight o'Clock in the Morning I saw her open the Windows ; I asked her what was the Matter , that she screamed out so ? She said , she was taken with the Cramp , and the Cholick ; she said , she went to Bed about ten o'Clock ; I asked her why she did not come down Stairs ; she said , she could not have come down Stairs for all the World - to the best of my Knowledge the streaming came out of the Room where she lay , up three Pair of Stairs . Q . Was it known that she was with Child ? Oldfeild . Yes , it was known . Thomas Ayers . I was sent for to search Mrs Webster 's Vault ; I searched a little while , and I found one Child ; then I took off the Top of the Vault , and made a larger Search , and found another Child . - As to whose Children they were , I can not tell ; they were supposed to be the Children of the Prisoner at the Bar . Thomas Ball . On the 14th of September I was at the Examination of the Prisoner ; and found , by her Examination , that there was a Child in the Vault ; I fetched the last Witness to help me Search for it , and we found a Child : When the Midwife saw it , she said , there was another ; and after a further Search I took that up . - Bennet . The Prisoner 's Sister lodges at my House , and I saw her make several Things fit for a Child ; the Prisoner was to lie in at my House ; I had a Bed ready at a Minute 's Warning . Ann Scrogham . The Prisoner is my Sister-in-Law ; she had made Provision for the Child ; these are the Things ; she was to have lain-in at Mrs Bennet 's . - I made the Things by the Prisoner 's Order . Robert Simmonds . I am a Practitioner in Midwifry . Q. I would ask whether it is usual with Women , when the Time of Child-bed draws near , to have a violent Inclination to go to the Vault ? Simmonds . It is very common ; and it is a common Prognostick of an approaching Birth . Q . Is it not possible , when a Women is in that Condition , for the Child to fall from her ? Simmonds . Yes , to be fare . Jury . Where did your Servant lie ? Webster . In the Garret . Acquitted . The Jury found , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , that the Children were still-born . 492. John Mercy , of St. George Hanover Square , was indicted for stealing 10 lb . Weight of Cart iron , value 9 d. the Goods of Thomas Stanley , Sept. 10 . Thomas Stanley . I can only say that I lost my Iron off my Cart . - Neilson . About two o'Clock in the Morning I was going my Rounds by Hide-Park Corner , and saw a Man pass me with a Bag ; I asked him what he had got there ; he said he had got something , but would give no Account what he had got ; I took hold of him , and examin 'd what he had , and ask 'd him who it belonged to ; he said it belonged to a Cow-Feeder below the Hospital at Knightsbridge ; acquainted Mr Stanley with it , and he said it belong 'd to his Cart . Giles Boderseild . There are two Iron Back-bands , a Chain , and two Pins , which , I am sure , belonged to my Master Stanley 's Cart - This is the Iron which was taken off the Cart . Guilty . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 493 , 494. John Durant was indicted for stealing a great Cloth Coat , value 5 s. the Goods of James Pearce , October 8 . and Joseph Brittle for receiving the same , knowing it to be stole Mrs Pearce . I was going out of Town , and ordered the Coachman to stop at the London Assurance to take up Mr Pearce ; Mr Pearce 's great Coat was behind the Coach , and I saw the Coat thrown into a Hackney Coach . Q . Did you see the Coat taken away ? Mrs Pearce . I did not see it taken away ; but seeing the Coat thrown into the Coach ; I said , Pray now , why did you take away my Coat ; the Prisoner Durant said , he thought it was a Hackney Coachman 's Coat ; said I , that Coat does not look like a Hackney Coachman 's Coat ; whereupon the Coat was brought back directly . Q . Was the Man that brought it back , the same Man that took it away ? Mrs Pearce . I can not say that ; when the Coat was thrown into the Hackney Coach ; I said , That is my great Coat ; and Durant brought it back directly , and put it again in its Place . Q . Did he attempt to drive away ? Mrs Pearce . Not till the other Prisoner was taken up . Henrietta Martin Pearce . While the Footman was gone into the London Assurance-Office , the Coat was thrown into a Hackney Coach ; I called to the Prisoner , and he took it directly out of the Coach , and brought it back again . Mrs Pearce . The other Man who is charged with receiving it , only made a Joke of it . Q . How near were the Coaches to each other ? H. M. Pearce . They were so near , that the Man straddled from one Coach to the other , and they could not hand the Coat from one to the other without my seeing of it . John Rawlins . Capt . Pearce gave me charge of John Durant ; I met Durant 's Master , Mr Alexander , in Lombard-street , as I was going along with Durant ; said he , You have done for yourself very finely ; I would rather have given 500 l. than this Thing should have happened ; I would have you learn to be honest ; Friend , said Durant , to me , I am afraid this will touch my Life ; said I , I can not tell the Consequence of it ; and , he said , he did take the Coat from behind Mr Pearce 's Coach , and threw it into his Partner 's Coach : Afterwards we met young Mr Alexander , said he , how comes this about , that you have stole a Gentleman 's Coat ; he said , I can not help it now , and if I was to be hanged . I would speak the Truth ; I did do it , and slung it into my Partner 's Coach ; and the other said , he thought it was a poor Hackney Coachman 's Coat , and that they took it up for fear it should be lost ; I apprehend Durant was learning to drive a Coach ; and Brittle drove the Coach , that the Coat was thrown into ; Brittle made a Laugh at it , and owned , that Durant did sting the Coat into his Coach . James Redmain . I was coming up Cornhill last Saturday ; and Mr Pearce 's Coach was waiting at the London Assurance-Office ; Mrs Pearce and Miss Pearce were in the Coach ; and hearing something of a Dispute ; I asked Mrs Pearce what was the Matter ; she said , a Person had taken a Coat from behind her Coach , and put it into another Coach , and wished that the Man could be secured ; a Soldier came by immediately afterwards , who stopped , to hear what Mrs Pearce was saying ; and he heard Mrs Pearce talk of a Coat that was taken from behind her Coach ; I said , If you will go along with me , we will secure him ; I asked Durant how he came to take the Coat ; he said , I thought it had been a Hackney Coachman 's Coat , and as it was so , I did not think there was any Harm in it , but I will go and ask Mrs Pearce 's Pardon upon my Knees he owned , that he took it , from behind Mr Pearce 's Coach , and hoped she would excuse him . - Holloway . I was coming by the Royal-Exchange , about one o'Clock , on Saturday last , and heard Capt . Pearce 's Lady make an Outcry , and say , that she was robbed of her Husband 's great Coat , and that the Person who took it was just by ; I desired her to shew me the Person that took it ; and , she said , it was the Man in the blue Grey ( Durant ) I said to Durant , Do n't take it amiss , but you must take a Walk to the Lady 's Coach ; when he came to her , he made a Sort of a Bend , and said , he never knew any Harm before ; and begged that she would forgive him ; I heard old Mr Alexander say , I gave you a Caution to be honest , but I find you did not regard it ; and afterwards I met young Mr Alexander ; and he said to him , You will not be honest ; and Durant said , he would be honest . Q . Did he run away ? Holloway . He was willing to be backward , he had no Mind to go forward . Thomas Gower . I folded the Coat up , and put it behind the Coach upon the Step ; I was going into the London-Assurance-Office to let my Master know that the Coach was ready , and by that Time I came back the Coat was gone , and they had got a Constable , and secured the Prisoners . Q . Was it not possible for the Coat to fall down ? Gower . I had placed it so upon the Step that I thought it was impossible for it to fall down . Q . Was the Coat fastened to the Step ? Gower . There was no fastening but only the Step to hold it . - Alexander , Senior . The two Prisoners at the Bar are very honest Fellows ; one of them has lived with me between five and six Years , and the other a Year ; they came from Mr Jennings 's to me ; I had a very good Character of them ; there are not two honester Fellows in the World . - Alexander , Junior . I know both the Prisoners ; I believe them to be very honest sober Men : I have a particular Reason for saying so of John Durant , because when he first came to me , I employed him to drive the Horses upon the Road , and gave him Money to defray Expences , and I kept a private Account against him , and did not let him know that I kept any Account , and when I settled with him his Accounts were always very fair and just . Liscomb Price . I have known Brittle ever since he lived with my Father-in-Law , Mr Alexander ; I had Occasion to remove , and I entrusted him with near 2000 l. Value ; and if I had the same Occasion for him To-morrow I would entrust him again . - Bridware . I have known Brittle some Years ; he is looked upon to be a Man of an exceeding good Reputation ; I know Mr Alexander to be a Man of one of the best Characters in the World , and I know that he respected him - The I know but little of . - Rooke . I know both the Prisoners I never heard but that they bore the Character of very honest Men ; they are singular Men in their way , as Hackney Coachmen , for they generally hear but very indifferent Characters . I have done Business for Mr Alexander twenty Years , and he says he never had two such Servants in his Life . Mr North . I have sometimes had occasion to make of Mr Alexander , and have been drove by Brittle , and he always was a sober honest Fellow to the best of my Judgment . - Quiron . I believe them to be as honest Men as any in England ; Durant when he was but a Lad lived two Years with Mr Jennings , of Acton-Place ; I was Fellow-Servant with him , he behaved vastly well ; he was as good a Fellow-Servant as ever I had in my Life ; he came from thence to Mr Alexander . Mrs Crewis . Durant has been my Servant to drive me for about two Years , and always behaved very well ; and if he was discharged he should be my Servant again . Both Acquitted . 495 . + Ann Neale was indicted for stealing three Gold Rings , value 40 s. the Goods of Edward Bennet , in his Shop , Sept 28 . Edward Bennet . I am a Goldsmith on London-Bridge . On the 28th of September the Prisoner at the Bar came to my Shop to buy a Gold Ring : She pulled a Ring off her Finger , and said she wanted a larger than that ; I showed her one , and then I showed her two more ; she had one visible in her Hand , and out of those three she conveyed two away . - When I missed one of the Rings , I put two more upon the Counter , and said I was sure one of them would do ; when I put them upon the Counter , I was not sure whether the other was gone or no ; I was a little surprized ; and I put two more upon the Counter , and said to myself , I will see what will be the Event of this . I took particular Notice of her , and saw her put her Hand up to her Mouth ; with that I clapped my Hand upon her Wrist , and said , Child , you have got three of my Rings , and I will have them before you go ; my Wife was above Stairs , but hearing a Noise in the Shop she came down Stairs , said I , My dear , do you go on the other Side of the Counter , and take hold of her other Hand ; which I bid her do , least the Prisoner should convey them away ; said I , They are either in her Mouth , or in her Bosom ; then the Prisoner said , If you will not expose me , I will give them to you . I bid my Wife take her backwards and search her ; which she did , and found the three Rings upon her ; they were concealed in her Bosom . - I am sure they are my Rings ; - When I missed the first Ring I was afraid of being mistaken , and was willing to be sure before I challenged her , and that made me lay two Rings upon the Counter . Mrs Bennet . Hearing a Noise in the Shop , I came down Stairs , and my Spouse told me the Prisoner had got some of his Rings , and he bid me go on the other Side of the Counter , and take hold of her Hand ; I took hold of her Hand , and she seemed to be in a great Surprize , and said she had none of the Rings , said I , You must have them , and it does not signify any Thing your denying it ; she seemed to want to go backward , and said , If I would go back with her she would give them to me . She put her Hand into her Bosom and pulled one of the Rings out , and gave it to me ; I said she had got more ; she put her Hand in again , and said she had got no more : Mr Bennet put his Head into the Entry and said , She has got three ; with that I put my Hand into her Bosom and took out two more , and gave them to Mr Dobson . Dobson . I am a Hosier and live over-against Mr Bennet 's ; seeing a Croud about the Door , I went over and asked what was the Matter ; says he , There 's a Woman has taken three Rings , she is backwards with my Wife ; Mrs Bennet had just taken the Rings from the Prisoner , and she delivered them to me . Q . Was the Prisoner out of the Shop ? Edward Bennet . No , she was not , because I held her , and would not let her go out . Q . What did she go backwards for ? Bennet . She went backwards , to deliver the Rings to my Wife . Benjamin Champion . The Prisoner lived with me three or four Months . Q . How long is it since she lived with you ? Champion . About three or four Months ; I never had any Suspicion of her Dishonesty ; she has been in my House every Week since she went away , 'til she was under Confinement . Q . Upon what Account did she go away ? Champion . She went away , because she was not strong enough to do our Business ; the Prisoner always behaved in a very handsome modest Manner ; she is a young Creature ; I hope the Court will be tender of her Life . Q . What Age is she ? Champion . She was twenty-one Years of Age the Day she was committed . Miles Dalton . The Prisoner lived with me near twelve Months , about three Years ago , and behaved in a discreet modest Manner ; my Wife had an extraordinary good Character of her ; she was a very young Creature ; then she was about seventeen Years of Age , and behaved exceedingly well ; I never heard any Thing to the contrary of her since , but that she was a prudent modest discreet Girl ; and her Family prudent modest discreet People ; I believe it is the first Time that ever she had any Imputation of any Thing of this kind . Zachariah Ingram . I have known the Prisoner for three or four Months past , she lodged in my House ; and all the Time her Behaviour was modest , pretty , and discreet ; she was a good Companion to my Wife ; she behaved so well , that I could have trusted her with any Thing . - Macguire .

On Monday the 5th of September , Mrs Wingfield came to drink a Dish of Tea with me , I bid my Servant ( the Prisoner ) put the Things in Order for the Tea , and cut some Bread and Butter ; she brought in some ; says Mrs Wingfield , I desire a little more Butter upon the Bread . I called my Servant ; said I , Dorothy , what Sort of Bread and Butter is this ? You have not cut it as it should be ; I spoke to her in a mild Manner for she never saw me out of Temper ; to this she said it was well enough ; I smiled at it , and shewed her the Bread and Butter , said I , is this fit to bring into Company ; said she , What is the Matter with it ? It is well enough . I went into the Kitchen , and asked her how she could serve me so ; said she , Madam , you eat none yourself , and I think it is good enough for your Company . Why , said I , is it good enough ? Do you know any Thing of my Company ? Yes , said she , I know them better than you do , and knew them before you did ; said I , it is very impudent in you to use my Friend in this Manner . When I went into the Parlour again , said Mrs Wingfield , Why do you trouble yourself about the Bread and Butter ? I do n't matter whether I have any : Said I , Madam , my Maid says she , knew you before I did , and knows you better than I do ; said Mrs Wingfield , My Dear , with your Leave , I will go out and speak to her , and ask her how she came to know me , for I do not remember ever to have seen her . Mrs Wingfield went out of the Parlour , and presently I heard somebody cry out , I went to the Kitchen , and found Mrs Wingfield on the Ground , upon her Back , her Head rais 'd a little Way off the Ground ; said I , Lord , have Mercy upon me , what 's the Matter ; Mrs Wingfield said , my Maid had beat and abused her in a very gross Manner . Mrs Wingfield was in a very bad Condition , and very much bruised . Mrs Wingfield . I went to pay a Visit to Miss Kendall ; she ordered the Tea to be brought , and called for a Plate of Bread and Butter . I desired she would order her Maid to put a little more Butter upon the Bread ; there was very little Butter upon it , and she brought it in , in a very unhandsome Manner ; it seemed as if Children had been biting it . I smiled at the Bread and Butter ; Mrs Kendall called her Maid in , and said , What is the Matter that the Bread and Butter is cut in this unseemly Manner ? The Maid said , it was well enough ; Mrs Kendall ordered her to cut some more , and that was cut much in the same Manner ; said she , I 'll go out , and speak to her about it ; said I , Madam , do n't trouble yourself ; said Mrs Kendall , I can speak to her without being in a Passion ; she went , and when she came in again , she told me , her Maid said , it was good enough for her Company ; and that , she said , she knew me before she did , and better than she did ; said I , I will go out and speak to her ; I went to the Kitchen-Door , said I , pray , young Woman , do you know me ? She came flying towards the Kitchen-Door , with a brass Ladle in her Hand , and said , D - n you for a Bitch , I do n't know you , and I do not desire to know you ; with that she fell upon me , flung me upon the Ground , tore my Cloaths , struck me , and beat me in a violent Manner with the Ladle , and , I believe , kicked me , but I can not say positively , being in a Fright , whether she did or no ; Lord have Mercy upon me ; said I , my Sister ( Ann Grignion ) hearing my Voice , and that I cried out ; she called to this young Lady ( Mrs Kendall ) and when they came , there was I lying upon the Ground , my Heels in the Kitchen , my Head in the Passage ; said my Sister to the Maid , What have you done to my Sister ? She then flew upon her , and fastened her Hands in her Hair - I was bruised so , that I have not been well a Day since . Prisoner . I did not do any such Thing ; here is a Woman that was in the Kitchen at the same Time , that knows , I did not ; I have been in Goal six Weeks to Day for nothing at all . Hannah Fewlis . I had lived with Mrs Kendall , and was there accidentally ; when I came , I heard there had been some disobliging Words ; my Mistress called to me to fill the Pot , and bid me cut some Bread and Butter ; and by that Time I had cut four Pieces , Mrs Wingfield opened the Door , came into the Kitchen , and said , to the Prisoner , Do you know me ? Or , how do you know me ? I saw the Maid down in a Chair , and Mrs Wingfield was o'top of her . Q . Did not you hear a Bustle ? Fewlis . Yes , there was a Sort of a Bustle , and presently Mr Waldo and Mrs Wingfield 's Sister came . Q . Was that at the End of the Quarrel ? Fewlis . No , it was at the Beginning of it . Q . How long had Mrs Wingfield been in the Kitchen before you saw this ? Fewlis . I had cut one Piece of Bread and Butter . Q . As you were cutting Bread and Butter , how could you see what they did ? Fewlis . Immediately upon the Lady 's coming into the Kitchen , I turned my Face round towards them . Q . What was the Maid doing of ? Fewlis . She was washing her Dishes - when Mrs Wingfield came in , she was rincing a Plate , and had just sat it down upon the Table ; and when Mrs Wingfield asked her , whether she knew her , she said , Get out you Slut . Q . What was done next ? Fewlis . I can not tell what was done next , for then I turned about to cut another Bit of Bread and Butter . Q . When the Maid said , Get out , you Slut , did you turn your Head from them ? Fewlis . Yes . Q . How long did this Fray continue ? Fewlis . It was only while I was cutting a Piece of Bread and Butter . Q . Did not you hear a Crying out ? Fewlis . I heard no crying out , but only a Bustle . Q . Well , tell us what you saw of the Matter ? Fewlis . I saw this Maid thrown down in the Chair , and Mrs Wingfield upon her . Q . How did the Chair stand ? Fewlis . The Chair was quite thrown back . - Mrs Wingfield had hold of her , and Mr Waldo was striving to part them , and I went directly to them , and he said I will undo her Hands , and they rose up ; and then there was the Lady 's Sister , and an Apprentice came into the Kitchen ; - All the Bustle was at once . Q . What Part of the Room did you see them in ? Fewlis . It was all at one Place - just by the Kitchen Door . Q . Where was the Defendant , when Mrs Wingfield asked her what she had to say to her ? Fewlis . At the Sink . Q . Then she went to the other End of the Room to Mrs Wingfield , and bid her go out of the Kitchen , and called her Slut ? Fewlis . Yes , she did go to her , to be sure - I did not see any Ladle in her Hand - nor hear any Body cry out - nor see any Body upon the Ground ; nor any Blows struck at all - there was no body in the Kitchen , besides me and the Maid , when Mrs Wingfield came in . Hannah Pearson . This young Woman , before she went to live with Mrs Kendall , was my Lodger , she was a good Girl , and behaved in a very pretty Manner ; I have known her a Year and an half , and all the Neighbours gave her a good Character . Q. to Mrs Wingfield . Hannah Fewlis says , the Maid was down in the Chair , and you upon her , is that Fact ? Mrs Wingfield . Upon my Word , I did not see her down , for I was glad to get away . Ann Grignion . I heard my Sister ( Mrs Wingfield ) cry out , and went into the Kitchen , and saw her lying upon the Ground with her Hands up ; and , she said , Lord have Mercy upon me ; I turned about to the Maid , and said , what have you done to my Sister ; upon that she fastened upon me , tore my Cap off , twisted her Hands in my Hair , and did not let me go , till Mr Waldo came into the Kitchen - My Sister had got loose from her then . Q . How did the Prisoner stand ? Mrs Grignion . She stood over my Sister with the Ladle in her Hand . Q . Did you see the Maid down in the Chair , and your Sister upon her ? Mrs Grignion . No , she was not down at all , either in the Chair , or otherwise ; Mr Waldo was called up to rescue my Sister from her . Mr Waldo . I was below in the Shop , and hearing a Noise above Stairs , I went up , and found Mrs Grignion down on the Ground , and the Defendant 's Hands in her Hair ; and I did , with some Difficulty , get her Hands out of her Hair . Q . Did you see the Defendant down in a Chair , and Mrs Wingfield upon her ? Waldo . No , she was standing up against the Wainscot . Guilty * . * The Prisoner had withdrawn her Plea of Not-Guilty , and confessed the Indictment ; the Evidence was given in Aggravation : The Court were inclinable to think the Prisoner was disordered in her Senses , or in Liquor ; for it did not appear to them , that Mrs Kendal telling Mrs Wingfield , she was about parting with her Maid , Mrs Wingfield was recommending one to her ; and the Servant being backward and forward in the Room , heard their Discourse : This however is said to be the Case , and will in some Measure account for this violent Outrage .

Servant , Charles Fletcher . Ford . The Prisoner came to me to the Bench at St Lawrence 's Church , and told me he had got a Jobb for me , and I went with him into Maiden-Lane before I knew what he had for me to do ; then he ordered me to go to Mr Freeman 's , at the Bell in Noble-street , and give him this Letter ; says he , Stay till he opens it , and he will give you five Shillings .

Q . Was there no Discourse passed between Mr Freeman , and you ? Ford . No , his Daughter and he had some Talk at the Table , but he did not ask me any Questions . Prisoner .

I did say so , but it was after such time that we had discovered the Cheat . Prisoner .

Freeman . I believe I said , I question whether I should have sent them , the Letter coming from such a Person . Charles Fletcher . I never sent to borrow five Shillings of Mr Freeman in my Life . This Letter is not my Writing , I never sent such a Letter . Q . Did you ever see the Prisoner in Mr Freeman 's House ?

Eunice Corbet . The Prisoner lodged with us three Quarters of a Year , and paid us very honestly ; he had been away from his Lodging some Time , and came to it again , and on Saturday the 9th of July , the Day this happened , Mr Field brought the Key of the Room down to me ; said I , Mr Field , how came you to lie in Bed so long , when 't is Saturday Morning ?

The Porter was threatened with a Warrant himself , if he did not find out the Person who sent him with the Letter . Ford . After I had received the Money of Mr Freeman , I returned to the Bench , and about half an Hour afterwards the Prisoner came to me again , and asked me if I was at Leisure , for he had another Letter for me , to carry to Mr . Handy , in Whitecross street ; when I carried the Letter to him , says he , This Fellow is a Rogue ; then , said I , he is a Rogue to Mr Freeman ; and when Mr Freeman was enquiring into the Affair , he said , Did he give you Orders to say he came from Fleet-street ? Yes , said I , he did ; then Mr Freeman said , I believe you are a Rogue as well as he . Prisoner . Was not you threatned to be committed if you did not find the Person out that sent you with the Letter ? Ford .

[ This and the following Trial came on at the preceding Sessions , but for want of Room were then omitted . ] William Waller . On the 25th of last May , about three o'Clock in the Afternoon , as I was coming along Black Boy-Alley , there were six or seven young Fellows together ; says the Prisoner to one of them , Have you got any Corn for my Horse ? ( though he was on Foot ) then , he said , D - n you here 's a Baker , I will have some Bread for my Horse ; says I , but I believe you wont ; with that they gave me a Blow upon my Head , and knocked me down , and the Bread rolled about the Alley - The Prisoner is the Man that struck me first on the Head , with a short Stick ; and after I was down , he put his Hand into my Pocket , and took out 4s . two Sixpences , and some Half pence ; there was a Soldier five or six Yards before me ; I got the Bayonet from the Soldier , and cut one of them down the Head ; and then they began to be outragious ; Ann Bird took me into a House ; she said , Come in here , or you will be murdered ; I was going over a back way ; says she , Do n't go over there . if you do you will go into Long Charles 's Yard , and then you will be murdered Nathaniel Eld . On the 25th of May , about three o'Clock in the Afternoon , I was coming down Black-Bay-Alley , at a small Distance from the Prosecutor ; I heard a Noise , and saw the Prosecutor down upon the Ground , with his Basket by him ; I went to his Assistance , and there came a Parcel of young Fellows about me , who threatened my Life . Q . Was the Prisoner one of them ? Eld . I was so flustrated that I could not be positive to the Man , but I thought it was my best way to get off ; William Waller laid hold of my Bayonet , took it from me , and cut one of them down the Head . As soon as the Baker got up , he said , he was robbed . John Thompson . I heard the Prisoner say , if it had not been for a Blue-Boat [ a Bubo ] under his Arm , he would have done for Mr Waller . Prisoner . How long had I been took , when he said , I had robbed him ? Thompson . About half an Hour . Prisoner 's Defence . Mary Britton . I saw this Waller , the Baker , coming down the Alley , with a Soldier ; and Waller cut the Prisoner down the Head . Q . Did you see any Thing that was done before that ? Britton . I did not see any Thing done ; there were some Words passed . Court . You say you saw Waller cut the Prisoner down the Head ? Britton . No , not the Prisoner , it was another Man ; the Prisoner was not there . Q . How do you know he was not there ? Britton . I am sure he was not there - I saw the beginning of the Quarrel - There were a pretty many People there . Q . What was the beginning of the Quarrel ? Britton . I heard them talk of Bread . Q . Did you see Waller down upon the Ground ? Britton . I did not see him down - After he had cut the Man down the Head , he run along the Alley ; and I was afraid he would come to some Damage among them , so I bid him come into my Yard . Q . What did he say when he came in ? Did he say he had been robbed ? Britton . Not at first ; he had been in the House some time before he talked of being robbed ; and then , he said , he would swear a Robbery against them - I live in Black-Boy-Alley , my Husband is a Buckle-Maker . Thomas North . I saw the Baker and the Soldier run down by the Corner of the Alley where I live . Q . Did you see any Thing of this Quarrel ? North . I saw some-body hit the Baker 's Basket , and he sat it down , and went to the Soldier , and took the Bayonet out of the Sheath , and struck one of the Men on the Head , and I thought he would have run him through the Body at first ; he cut him on the Head , so that the Blood run down his Neck - I did not see any Body meddle with him . Q . Did you see him down upon the Ground ? North . I did not see him down . Q . Did not you see them throw Stones at the Baker ? North . Yes , I believe they did ; and then the Baker , got into Mrs Britton 's Yard . Q . Did you see the Prisoner there ? North . Yes - no , I did not see the Prisoner there - I know the Prisoner , but I am positive he was not there at that Time - I live in Sharp's-Alley by Cow-Cross . Waller . It is all the same Place . Mary North . I lay-in at the same Time , and hearing a Noise , I opened the Window , and looked out ; I saw the Baker throw his Basket off his Shoulder , and run to the Soldier , and drew the Scabbard out of the Sheath [ Bayonet out of the Scabbard ] and struck a Man , and made him run all down with Blood . Q . Who did he strike ? North . I do n't know , he was a strange Man . Robert Field . I was standing at my own Door in Sharp's-Alley , against the Two Fighting Cocks , and saw the Baker quarrelling with two or three Men ; he put down his Basket , and fell a fighting with them , and afterwards drew a Bayonet from the Soldier , and cut one of them over the Head . Q . Was he down upon the Ground ? Field . He was not down - I did not see them above a Minute . Q . Did not you see the Prisoner there ? Field . I did not see him there upon my Word . Waller . He is a Money-Dropper . - Dangerfield . I live in Sharp's-Alley ; I heard the Man speak to the Prosecutor ( not the Prisoner at the Bar ) the Man said , What 's become of your Fowls ? The Prosecutor said , he that stole the Fowls was hanged ; upon his saying that the Man was hanged that stole the Fowls , the Man struck him - I know the Prisoner , but he was not there . William Hawkins called . Waller . He has been an Evidence , and has hanged three Men in this Court . William Hawkins . I have known the Prisoner about half a Year , I never heard any Thing amiss of him in my Life . About seven Weeks ago , I was arrested by one William Palmer Hind ; and this Baker came to me , and said , that I was the Man that robbed him ; Hind said , Are you sure that 's the Man , and he said , I am sure he is the Man ; and afterwards , he said , if I was not the Man , I was very much like him ; another Time , he sent a Soldier to me , and he did not know me , but he never came any more ; so I went before a Justice , and was discharged . William Palmer Hind . I had arrested Hawkins for a Note of his Hand , and when he wanted to be discharged , I was told I must not discharge him , for he was charged with a Street Robbery ; said I , let me get my Fees before you charge him , which accordingly I did ; and a Baker charged him with robbing him ; he was carried before Justice Poulson , but the Baker could not make his Argument good ; then there was a Soldier came , and he said , he believed he was the Man , but could not swear to any but the Man that was cut on the Head - Waller said , first of all , that Hawkins robbed him ; and afterwards , he said , that he was not positive that he was the Man . Tho Westcomb . The Prisoner is my Son-in-Law ; I put him out Apprentice to a Cordwainer , and his Master was so cruel to him , that he was forced to go away , and leave him ; I never knew him guilty of any such Thing ; since he came from his Master , he has set up the Business of Shoe-cleaning , and any thing he could get to do . Martha Westcomb . I was informed , that my Son had committed a Street-Robbery , and that he would be hanged , without a great deal of Money - I do not know who said it . Q . Was it Mr Waller or the Soldier that said that ? Westcomb . No ; I said , I would rather that the House should fall down , and knock his Brains out , than he should be hanged . Margaret Monk . I have known the Boy these 12 Months ; he has drawn Beer , and brought it to our House ; he is a Boy of a very good Character . Two other Witnesses gave him the Character of an honest Lad .

Acquitted . 503 . + Jane Price was indicted for stealing a Silver Watch , value 50 s. the Property of George Puckford , privately from his Person , July 10 . George Puckford . On the 10th of July I lost my Watch , just going into Well Close-Square ; I went into the Blue Anchor Alehouse , to speak to the Woman of the House ; and when I came out again , the Prisoner followed me from that Door to the turning going down into the Square ; I went with her to her House , and when I was in , she shut the Door upon me , and said , You must make me drink ; I put my Hand into my Pocket , to give her Three-pence ; and , at the same Time , I felt her put her Hand to my Side - I had my Watch when I went into the House - I had not been in the House above a Quarter of a Minute - there was another Woman , but she was at the other End of the Room - there was no body near me but the Prisoner - as soon as the Woman came in with the Pot of Beer ; the Prisoner took it in her Hand , and drank , Here , says she , take hold of it or I will throw it upon you , and she run away directly ; I gave the Pot into the other Woman 's Hand , and whipt out at the Door directly after her ; I followed the Prisoner till she was out of Sight , and could not overtake her ; somebody asked me what I would give , if they took her ; I said , I would give half a Crown ; and in about eight or ten Minutes Time the Prisoner was brought to me ; she laughed at me , and said , Sir , I suppose you want your Watch ; yes , said I , I do ; then , said she , Sir , you must pay half a Guinea for it ; I told her if I must pay half a Guinea , I would , and I told her I could go to the House that I came from , and get it , but they would not let me go ; there was a Man in the Crowd that offered to lend me half a Guinea , but I would not accept of it : As soon as I saw her , I took her by the Arm , and held her , till a Constable took Charge of her ; then she would have pulled her Apron or her Handkerchief off her Neck , and have given me in lieu of my Watch , she offered me both - from the Time I missed my Watch to the Time I saw her again , might be upwards of twenty-one or twenty-two Minutes - she said ; she had pawned the Watch , but did not say where she had pawned it . Thomas Webb . About the 10th of July last , I took Charge of the Prisoner in Well Close-Square ; she was charged with stealing a Watch from Mr Puckford ; I asked her whether she had the Watch or no ; she said she knew nothing of the Watch , nor never saw it ; I said , my Dear , I will go with you into the first Publick-House I come to , and if you know any thing of the Watch you had better tell me ; I went into a Publick-House with her and searched her , but I found no Watch , only Three-pence Half-penny , which was tied up in the Corner of her Handkerchief . She said she believed Mr Puckford had been in Company with another Woman ; I asked her again , whether she knew any thing of it ; she said she would say nothing before such a Mob ; I went with her into a private Room , and then she told me the Watch was pawned for Half a Guinea ; - she said she did not pawn it , but she knew who did , and where ; I came to Mr Puckford and told him the Watch was pawned for Half a Guinea , and that he might have it again paying the Half Guinea ; he desired I would lend him Half a Guinea ; I told him I had no Money about me ; but a Friend of mine said , he would lend me a Guinea . Mr Puckford agreed , that I should go with the Prisoner to the Place , which was about two hundred Yards , it was the Sign of the White-Horse , ( it is often called the Yorkshire-Gray ) in Rag-Fair , one Mr Smith keeps the House ; it is a House where a great many of these People resort . When the Prisoner came into the House , she asked for the Watch ; she whispered the People of the House , but I did not hear what she said ; she said , if I would give the Money to any of the People there , I should have the Watch ; but I would not trust the Money with them , for I did not know but the Money might be gone as well as the Watch ; I gave a Guinea to the Daughter of the Man of the House to change , and I got the Watch from this Alehouse , and I paid a Shilling for Interest , besides the Half Guinea . Q . What are Alehouse-keepers Pawnbrokers ? Webb . It was a Demand they made . Q . Why , it had not been pawned above half an Hour . Elizabeth Silvester . I live at the Blue Anchor Alehouse with my Mother , she keeps the House ; Mr Puckford came to tell me that two young Men from Deptford were to come and see me . Q . Was Mr Puckford in Liquor ? Silvester . He was not drunk , - he was neither drunk nor sober ; he was middling . Thomas Webb . ( The Constable ) Mr Puckford was very much in Liquor , and by all Circumstances , he had another Woman in his Company , before he was in Company with the Prisoner - the Prisoner told me so ; she said , he had been upon the Bed with another Woman . Jane Lee . I have known the Prisoner eight Years ; she goes out buying and selling old Cloaths ; her Father is a very honest Man - I never saw any Harm of her , but by buying and selling old Cloaths ; I was always conversant with her , and lived in her Father 's House - I live in Well Close Square . Puckford . That is the Woman that fetched the Beer - I am very sure of it , and here are Witnesses will swear it . Prisoner . There were three or four more Women with him . Acquitted .

Just Publish 'd , ( Price Five Shillings . ) The Elements of ALGEBRA , in a New and Easy Method ; with their Use and Application , in the Solution of a great Variety of Arithmetical and Geometrical Questions , by General and Universal Rules . To which is prefix 'd , An Introduction contain ing a succinct History of this Science . By Mr NATHANIEL HAMMOND , of the Bank . Extract from the Account of this Book in the Works of the Learned . ' The World has long complained of the Want ' of a proper Introduction to Algebrz . Some are ' so very concise , as if they were contriv 'd not to ' teach but introduce a Teacher ; others again are ' larger , but wrote with so little Condescension to ' the Understandings of such as are altogether unacquainted ' with the Science , that they are of very ' little Use to those who are most inclined to make ' use of them . Whence it comes to pass , that few ' find it practicable to make any Progress in Algebra ' without a Master , tho ' certainly-the Science ' in itself is far from surpassing a clear Head , and ' a tolerable Understanding . ' The Design of this Treatise , which is of a reasonable ' Bulk , and which contains nothing which ' is not solid , and to the Purpose , is to assist such ' as are engaged in teaching Algebra with a regular ' Method , and a large Stock of Examples ; to that ' their Scholars may find Employment in their Absence ; ' and to enable such as live in Country . ' Places , and must consequently want all other Tutors , ' except Books , to acquire such a Skill in ' this Science , as may enable them to spend a Portion ' of their Time agreeably in the Cultivation of ' their better Parts , and in rendering a natural Method ' of enquiring after Truth habitual . ' The Treatise begins with a copious Explication ' of the Fundamental Principles of the Art , and of ' the Signs and Method of Notation used therein ' The Author then proceeds to the several Rules , ' explaining them carefully and copiously in all their ' various Cases ; so that with a moderate Attention ' it is simply impossible for a Person , who desires to ' be Master of Algebra , to miss of his End . ' We never find this Writer advancing any thing ' out of its proper Place , or burthening the Mind ' of his Scholar with Rules , before they become necessary : ' He prosesses o have imitated the judicious ' Euclid in this Rebect ; and he has done it ' with equal Art and Flicity . By this means he ' has delivered the young Student in Algebra from ' that which is usually be most fatiguing Part of ' the Science , viz . The Doctrine of Surds , in the ' Manner in which it usually taught . By the ' same Means he leads h Reader directly to Equations ; ' and , by shewin him the Profit he is to ' reap from the Science encourages him to overcome ' all it Difficulties . But ' strong and more ' slowly through the rest of the Work , that whoever ' follow him , may be obliged to become Master ' of every Branch of the Art , so as to be a compleat ' Algebra , before he quits his Book , and ' not a Smatterer ' Quadratic Equations , and the Art of managing ' Converging S , the adoptable Invention of ' the incomparable Sir Isaac Newton , are here to ' clearly explained , and their several Cases so plainly ' set down , and so thoroughly explicated , that ' it may be truly said , there are no where else such ' Instructions to be met with . At the of the ' Book , we find abundance of Observations , necessary ' for enlightening such Minds as are willing ' to proceed still farther in analytic Discoveries ; ' so that considering the Compass of this Work , ' and that too is very moderate , it is as complete ' as possibly can be expected : And he who is ' thoroughly versed in it . will find no great Difficulties , ' when he proceeds to sublimer Studies . ' The Language is plain and natural . the Book is ' more copious than any other in Examples , and ' the Illustrations of them are so full and clear , ' that is impossible to mistake their Meaning . - Just Publish 'd , ( Price Two Shillings and Six pence ) A New Method of IMPROVING cold , wet , and barren LANDS , particularly Clayey Grounds .
