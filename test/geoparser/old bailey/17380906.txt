Joseph Upton , of St. Butolph Bishopsgate , was indicted for breaking and entering the House of Robert Allen , between the Hours of One and Two , in the Night , with intent to steal the Money and Goods of the said Allen , July 12 . Mr. Allen . I was call 'd up between 1 and 2 o'Clock in the Night , the 12th of July last , by a Neighbour 's Servant , who is a Baker , and lives over - against my House . I look 'd out of my Chamber Window , and he told me , somebody had been breaking into my Cellar . I desir 'd him to watch , 'till I could come down ; and when I came to examine the Cellar Door , I found one of the Bolts broke , and the Staples that belong 'd to the other , were broke likewise . I had order 'd my Servant to fasten them about Eight o'Clock ; which he did ; for after I had been out , to take a Pint of Beer , I return 'd Home , and about Nine , I saw them both fast . When I found the Door broke open , I order 'd my Servant to search the Cellar ; he found the Prisoner hid behind a Hogshead of Oyl , and lugg 'd him towards the Cellar Window ; then I help 'd to pull him out , and he was carry 'd to the Watch House . James Overate . I am Servant to Mr. Spurling , a Baker , over-against Mr. Allen 's . On the 12th of July , at Night , I was at Work there ; and hearing a Noise , I look 'd through a Hole in the Window , and saw a Man piddling about the Cellar Window ; I ask 'd him , what he was doing there ? upon which he rose up , and went away without speaking ; but I did not speak very loud , for fear some of his Companions might be about the Window , and do me a Mischief . Then I call 'd my Master up ; and when he and the Servants came down , I went out , and finding Mr. Allen 's Cellar Door wrenched open , I knock 'd at his Door , and acquainted him with it . He came down with his Apprentice , and as soon as they got a Candle , the young Man went into the Cellar , and I was going to my Work ; but before I had got to my own Door , he cry 'd out , - he had found the Man . Mr. Allen immediately shut the Cellar Door to keep them both in , 'till I came back ; then we open 'd the Door , and I help 'd to pull the Prisoner out . Elias Idle . I am Mr. Allen 's Servant . I fasten 'd the Cellar Window a little after Eight , and push 'd both the Bolts home . About Ten , I went to Bed , and a little after One , the Baker knock 'd at the Door , and said the Cellar Window was open . Upon this , my Master and I came down , and he order 'd me to go into the Cellar , where I found the Prisoner conceal 'd behind a Hogshead of Oyl . I call 'd for Assistance , and snatching up a Shovel , I stroke him a Blow , which made him reel ; then I seiz 'd him , and lugg 'd him to the Cellar Window , and my Master and the Baker took him out . I do n't remember that he spoke one Word , while he was in the Cellar ; nor had he any thing about him , but a Steel and a Tinder-box , which the Constable found in his Pocket . My Master is a Currier , and the Goods we have in the Cellar , are Butts of Leather and Oyl , which are pretty Bulky , but we carry them in by that Door . If the Prisoner had got into the House through the Cellar , he must have broke open more Doors . Prisoner . As to the Steel and Tinderbox , - I was going to my Wife at Colchester , and they were only to light my Pipe , as I went along . And as to my being found in the Cellar , - I had been drinking , and in passing along , I chanc 'd to fall down into it . Mr. Allen . He could not fall into the Cellar , unless he fell into it on purpose , after he had open 'd the Door ; and I am sure he was quite sober . Guilty . Death . 6. Elizabeth King , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing three Ounces of unwrought Silver , value 15 s. a Pair of Silver Salts , value 15 s. a brass Head for a Cane , value 1 s. the Goods of James Manners . A linnen Shirt , value 6 s. a Stock , value 6 d. and a reading Glass , value 6 d. the Goods of Anthony Rubey . August 12 . Guilty Felony . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 7 . 8 . * John Slade , and Henry Fluellin , of St. Clement Danes , were indicted for assaulting Henry Davis , in the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , & c. and taking from him a Hat , value 2 s. a Key , value 1 d. a Half Guinea , and 7 s. in Silver . July 9 . * See Sessions Book No . 1 . 1737 . Page 17 . No . 61 , 62 . The Witnesses were examined a-part . Henry Davis . On Sunday Night July 9 , as I was passing by St. Clements Church in the Strand , about eleven o'Clock , three Men came up to me in a hasty Manner ; two of them laid hold of me , one on each Side , and they run me up against the Wall , with Pistols in their Hands . Then they struck me several Blows with them , and told me , if I made the least Noise , they would shoot me through the Head , or blow my Brains out . Upon this , the third Man came up and put his Hand into my Breeches Pocket ; from whence he took Half a Guinea , 7 Shillings in Silver , a Key and a Piece of Nutmeg . When this was done , they asked me , if I had no more Money about me . I told them , they had got all I had , and immediately the Man that rifled me snatch 'd my Hat off . Then they left me , and run thro ' St. Clement 's Churchyard , and thro ' a narrow Passage towards Butcher-Row , so I saw no more of them . I am positive Fluellin is the Man that robb 'd me , for I very plainly saw him , as he rifled me , by a Lamp within two or three Door 's distance from the Place . I am very positive too , to Udal the Evidence ; he was one that held me , and I believe Slade was the other : it was a Man of his Stature , but I wo n't be positive to Him . Fluellin . On which Side of the Way , was this Robbery committed ? Davis . On the Right Hand Side , going from Temple bar , by the Alms-houses , and near the Church . Fluellin And pray what Distance was the third Man from the rest , before he came up to rifle you ? Davis . They were all pretty near together . As soon as the two Men laid hold of me , the other came up . Fluellin Well Sir ; and what Cloaths had I on ? Davis . Light colour 'd Cloaths , with flat Metal Buttons . My Hat was found at a Pawn-broker 's by the Direction of Udal . He was taken up for another Fact , and seeing him accidentally in Newgate , I tax 'd him with being concern 'd in this Robbery ; upon which he made a Confession , and discover 'd the two Prisoners . William Udal . I gave my Information before Capt . Margets . The Prisoners and I , about five Weeks ago , met at the Coach-and-Horses at Temple-Bar , where we staid about half an Hour ; then we agreed to go a Street Robbing . We accordingly went as far as Charing Cross ; but nothing offering , we came back again to the dead Wall by the Gulley-Hole , - 't is one Part of the Alms Houses near St. Clement 's Church-yard . There Slade and I caught hold of the Prosecutor by each Arm , and run him up against the Wall . Then we held a Pistol to his Forehead , and Fluellin came up , and took out of his Pocket a Half Guinea , seven Shillings in Silver , a Key , and a Piece of Nutmeg . When he had got the Man 's Money , he snatch 'd off his Hat , and we all run thro ' the Church-yard , and down the Butcher Row , to a Publick House , where we shar 'd the Money . The next Morning Fluellin and I pawn 'd the Hat in Aldersgate-Street for a Shilling , which we divided between us , and then we parted . Fluellin . On which Side of the Way was this done ? Udal . On the Right Hand Side ; - there 's a Cork-cutters Shop on this Side the dead Wall . Fluellin . Where did we share the Money ? Udal . Fluellin went into a Pastry-Cook 's in Fleet-street , and bought a Tart , or a Cheesecake ; there he got the half Guinea chang 'd ; and from thence we all went to the Thatch'd-house in Field-Lane , and divided the Money . Henry Atkins . About three Weeks ago I went with the Prosecutor to Newgate , to see Udal . While we were there , Udal desired me to go to Justice Margets , in order to his being admitted an Evidence . I went the next Morning ; and his Information was taken , in which he told of this Robbery , and where the Hat was pawn 'd for a Shilling , which I fetch 'd from a Pawn-broker 's in Aldersgate-street . Fluellin Udal the Evidence is a lewd Rascal ; he lives upon the Spoils of lewd Women : He was taken up for another Fact , and made an Information to save himself ; but finding the People he inform 'd against could not be taken , he made another , and put me and my Friend Slade into it . Mr . Car ( who is now in Newgate for defrauding a Banker ) drew his Information . Udal . * Ramsey and I had got some Things from a Surgeon , and I was taken up on that Account . While I was in Custody , Ramsey and Fluellin sent me a Letter , in which they promised me some Subsistence ; and this was the Reason I did not put them into my first Information . But when I was before Justice Margets , I thought if I did not inform of all I knew , he would not admit my Information . * Ramsey was the Evidence against Car and Cross , for defrauding Mr. Hoare . See Sessions-Paper Number V. Slade . What Cloaths had I on when this Robbery was committed ? Udal . Slade wore then a faded red Waistcoat , and ( I think ) red Breeches , and a Coat the Colour of mine . Fluellin had light Cloaths , and flat Metal Buttons to the best of my Knowledge . Ann Clark . I have known Slade 16 Years : I liv 'd with his Father and Mother eight Years , and have been always going to and fro the whole Time . For these 13 Months I have regarded his Conduct , and never saw any thing relating to ill , - but on the 9th of July , I met him at the New Church in the Strand , about Three o'Clock , and when the Sermon was over we went together to his Brother 's House in Burleigh-street in the Strand , and we were there together 'till Ten of the Clock , - he was never out of my Company ; - by the same Token he offer 'd to go home with me because it was so late , but I refused him . I have been there every Sunday these 3 Months ; for they have a Note of my Hand for Money I owe them , and as they are particular Friends , I always pay them on Sundays . I remember it was the 9th of July , because I made a Memorandum of paying the Money . John Cook . I have known Slade a great many Years ; the Method I knew him by , was by my making Stays for his Sister , who is now marry 'd to a Harpsichord-Maker . I thought him a civil sober Man , and of so mild a Temper , that he could not be guilty of so desperate a Fact . Udal . His Sister keeps a rank Baudy-House , - the Sign of the Barley-Mow . I have been at it several Times . Elizabeth Singer . I believe him to be a very sober Lad ; I never heard Ill of him , and always took him to be over-civilized . Ann Thrasher had been a Lodger six Months in his Brother 's House ; she said he always kept vast good Hours , and that she thought very often , - how happy his Friends were in him , - he was so very sober . Ann Clark added , that his Sister lived in a little House of eighteen Pounds a Year , and bore a good Character , to the best of her Knowledge . Slade acquitted . Fluellin guilty . Death . 9. Charles Golding , of Hampstead , was indicted for breaking and entering the Dwelling-House of Jane Maria Ward , about Twelve at Night , and stealing two Velvet Hoods , value 5 s. two Velvet Manteels , value 5 s. six silver Spoons , value 12 s. five Silver Tea Spoons , value 12 d. a Silver Tea-strainer , value 6 d. and two silver Salts , value 4 s . April 23 . George Townshend . Mrs. Ward is my Sister ; she lives at Hampstead , and I have an Apartment in her House . On the 23d of April , in the Night , I heard the Latch of the Door go up , so I got up about one o'Clock , and saw the Parlour Windows open . Upon which I cry 'd out Thieves ! And when the Neighbours came out , I went into the Hall with them , and we look 'd over the House . All the Things mentioned in the Indictment were missing , and a Pane of Glass was taken out of a Casement in the Hall-Window , ( I suppose ) to lift up the Latch and get it open . I have nothing to say against the Prisoner : I only speak to the Robbery , with these Circumstances ; and say the Goods lost were the Property of my Sister . I ca n't be sure as to the Condition of the House over Night , for we are in no great Fear of Thieves , because we keep Things of as little Value there as possible . Job Trip . I think it was on the 24th of April the Prisoner 's Brother 's Wife came to my House , to offer these 3 Spoons in Pawn . I thought they were not honestly come by , so I examin 'd her about them , she seem 'd angry , and went and fetch 'd her Husband , the Prisoner 's Brother , who told me they were his own . I was not satisfied with this , but got from him - that he liv 'd at Hampstead , and that his Name was George Ward , which prov 'd to be a wrong Name . I went upon this to Hampstead , and enquir 'd for him by that Name ; telling the People he appeared to me to be a Painter By the Description I gave of him , I heard his Name was John Golding , and that he liv 'd in such a Place . According to the Directions I had got , I went to his Uncle , and enquired if he had lost any Spoons ? He told me he had not , but a Gentlewoman who liv 'd higher upon the Hill had , and perhaps they might be her 's . He went with me to Mrs. Ward 's , I shew 'd her the Spoons , and she own 'd them , and asked me what sort of a Person brought them to me ? I described the Man , and she said it was the Man that painted her House a little before The Uncle upon hearing this , begg 'd she would be favourable , and he would endeavour to get the Things . Accordingly he brought the Prisoner and his Brother to her House , and the Prisoner took all the Blame upon himself , and said he broke open the House by himself . These 3 Spoons he gave me out of his own Pocket , and when I asked him for the Salts , he said he had carry 'd them to his Brother 's House , and the Brother run directly and fetch 'd them by the Prisoner 's Directions . There was a Velvet Hood likewise found in his Pocket , but as I could not be positive to that , I have not brought it . Mr. Townshend . These Spoons and Salts I know to be my Sister 's . Prisoner . I met my Brother and Sister in London , he was fuddled , and my Sister desired me to take these Things for fear he should lose them . Guilty , Death . 10. Thomas Raby , was indicted for assaulting William Backhouse on the King 's Highway , in the Parish of South Mimms , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 8 s. in Money , June 22 . William Backhouse . On the 22d of June last , I was going down to Northampton in the Waggon , and about 6 o'Clock in the Evening , just as we were on the other Side of Mimms Turnpike , the Prisoner and another Man came up to the hind part of the Waggon , and presenting a Pistol he cry 'd , - damn you , your Money in a Minute , - your Money in a Minute , or I 'll shoot you thro ' the Head immediately ; and he threatened the Driver that he would shoot him if he did not stop . Upon this , I gave him 8 or 9 s. I did not know exactly what Money I had in my Pocket , but I can swear to 8 s. and am positive to the Prisoner , he rode on a Black Horse , and his Companion on a Grey one . As soon as he had done with us , he said , - now Good-night to you and be damn 'd . William Tarry . The Waggon belonged to me , I was not in the Waggon when it was robb 'd , nor did I see him go up to it , but I met him as the rest of the Witnesses were pursuing him , and I endeavoured to take him ; but he swore he would kill us all if we came after him . However I rode after him , and caught him , then we carry 'd him to the 5 Bells at Mimms , where we got a Constable , and had him before Justice Peirce . - Keach . I drove the Waggon , and am very positive to the Prisoner , he met me as I was against the Horses , and swore if I did not stand , he would shoot me thro ' the Brains ; then he rid to the Arse of the Waggon , and put in his Pistol , swearing if they did not deliver he would shoot them all . They were not so ready as he would have had them , upon which he swore again , - if they did not deliver in a Minute they were all dead . His Companion was by him all this Time , and when they had got what they could they rode off ; Thomas Cook rode after them on Horse back , I ran after him on Foot , and William Tarry met him , and knock 'd him off his Horse , I got over a Hedge to them just as they had knock 'd him down . Tho . Cook . I did not see him rob the first Waggon ; but I saw him clap his Pistol into the Arse of the second ; so I call 'd to Keach and Tarry , and told them the Prisoner had robb 'd the Waggon ; we pursued him and took him . From the Time he committed the Robbery to the Time he was taken , he was never out of my Sight . Prisoner . My Lord , they pursu 'd me , and knock 'd me off my Horse , then they search 'd me , and found nothing upon me . The Constable . No , because he had thrown his Pistol over a Hedge . Tarry . While I was pulling a Stake out of a Hedge to knock him down with , he presented his Pistol to me , and swore he would kill me ; after which I saw him throw it over the Hedge , and when the Prisoner was before the Justice , I went back and found it . This is the Pistol , I found it where he had thrown it . Prisoner . I was very much disguised in Liquor , because I have a very weak Head , - I had no Pistol at all . Two Witnesses deposed , they knew no Ill of him before . Guilty , Death . 11. Dean Briant , of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted for the Murder of Mary his Wife , by giving her ( with a Clasp Knife ) on the left Part of the Back , near the left Hip , a mortal Wound , of the Breadth of one Inch , and Depth of one Inch , of which Wound she instantly died , July 7 . He was a 2d Time indicted for the said Murder , by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest . Lydia Cole . On the 7th of July in the Night , I was very ill with the Tooth-Ach , and an Ague in my Head , and not being able to sleep , I walked about my Chamber , which is a Ground Room , and joins to the Prisoner 's . About half an Hour after One , I heard somebody knock at his Door once or twice , and cry softly in a Man 's Voice , - Molly ! Molly ! Molly ! three Times . The Door was immediately open 'd , and he was let into the Room that joins with mine . No sooner was he got in , but Words arose ; then I heard a Blow given . Then Words , - then a Blow . At last I heard a Woman in a soft Voice cry , - do n't ! do n't ! do n't ! hurt me ! And the Man 's Voice answer 'd , - then d - mn your Blood you Bitch , do n't follow me . After this there were many Words pass 'd ; and the Woman talk 'd to him in a very moving Manner . When the Watchman came Two o'Clock , I heard no Noise , so I lay 'd myself down on my Bed ; but I had not lain long , before I heard the Woman either crying or squeeling . I jump 'd from the Bed again , and heard her groan , for a Quarter of an Hour , and every groan , grew fainter and fainter , 'till I could not hear it at all . From this Time , I heard no Noise , but only a dragging of something along the Floor , and then I imagin 'd the Man went out of the House again . Margaret Carter . I know nothing of the Murder ; but I can speak to the Prisoner 's Behaviour to his Wife at other Times . The Prisoner , the Deceased , and I , have been acquainted many Years . He always has been very vile in his Behaviour to her : beating and abusing her frequently , though she always behav 'd very mildly to him . The worst Words I ever heard her use to him , were , - why do you use me so ? 't is worse usage than I deserve I have seen her fall on her Knees and entreat him not to abuse her , and instead of being mov 'd with Compassion , he has beat her 'till she has bled . On the first of February last , she sent for me ; I found her darning , or running the Heels of his Stockings . As soon as she saw me , she burst out a crying , and said , she was now at a Distance from every Friend , and had no one to ease her Mind to . Her Husband ( she said ) was gone abroad in a great Passion ; and had told her , that he would neither bed with her , nor ever eat or drink with her more , and that if he met her in the Street , he would certainly kill her ; nor would he ever be Friends with her , unless she would own , she took a Guinea and a Half out of his Pocket , which she profess 'd she had never touch 'd . I was concern 'd at her Tale , and went down to the Waterside to see for him , but not finding him , I returned again to the Deceased . While I was with her , the Prisoner came in , and to get him into a good Humour , I invited him to come a House-warming to my House , but he refuss 'd : The poor Woman burst out a crying again , and told him she had made him some Broth , and beg 'd him to eat some ; he reply 'd , - no , d - mn you for a Bitch , I wo n't touch it , nor ever eat any Thing with you , 'till you have acknowledged you took the Money . She fell on her Knees , and hung about his Knees , declaring with a great many Tears , that she was Innocent ; but he up with his Fist , and dash 'd her away from him with such Violence , as to set her a bleeding . ( This Witness confirm 'd Mrs. Cole 's Evidence , with Regard to the Scituation of Cole 's Chamber and the Prisoner 's . ) William Brown . The Morning the Deceas 'd was murder 'd , I ran into the House , and found the Woman bleeding upon the Floor . The Prisoner sat in a Chair by the Table , and cry 'd , and said - Lord ! what have I done ! Samuel Cooling , Surgeon . I examin 'd the Wound ; It was about an Inch and a Half above the Hip ; and was about an Inch in Breadth , and an Inch and a Half deep . I pass 'd my Finger into the Orifice ; 't is my Opinion it was the Occasion of her Death , and that it was made with that Clasp Knife . ( A thick Clasp Knife was produc 'd in Court . ) The Constable This Knife I took from the Prisoner : 't is the very same . Mr. Cooling . I believe the Wound was given with this Knife , for it tallies exactly , both with the Hole in her Stays , and with the Wound . Q . Would that Knife have wounded her thro ' her Stays . A former Witness . Yes it would : and the Hole in the Stays tallies exactly with the Knife ? Jury . Was the Deceased found dead in the Room where Mrs. Cole imagin 'd she heard the Noise ? Mrs. Cole . Yes ; I saw the Prisoner in the Morning about Eight o'Clock going in at the Window up Stairs , by a Ladder ; when we was got in , I heard him say , - She is not here ! When he came down into the Kitchen , he cry 'd - O God ! O God ! my Wife is dead ! As soon as the Door was open 'd , an elderly Woman ran in . I went in after her , saw the Deceased lying upon the Ground , and a vast Quantity of Blood had run from the Wound . O Lord ( I cry 'd ) the Woman is murder 'd . Woollgar James Oseland . The Night this happen 'd , I went to do some Business at Mr. Bishop 's , in East Smithfield . Mr. Bishop was going to East Beccles , so he and his Wife and I went out together to see if he could get a Passage in the Ipswich Coach . It was about a Quarter or half an Hour after , when we went from Mr. Bishop 's Door ; before we had left the Door , the Prisoner came by ; Mr. Bishop asked the Prisoner where he was going at that Time o'Night ; I am going ( says he ) to the Strong Man 's , to see for my Wife ; for I have been Home , and though I see a Light in the House , I ca n't get in . - Pray where are you going ? My Master told the Prisoner , he was going to wait the coming by of the Ipswich Coach . Says he , I will go with you , and will pass my Time away 'till Morning . Accordingly he went with us as far as the Artichoke at Milend , where he laid himself down on a Bench , and said his Nose bled . While we waited for the Coach , he fell asleep , and when my Master had taken Coach , it was with difficulty we wak 'd him to come back with us . I took Notice that he was very melancholly , and loiter 'd behind my Mistress and me ; Lord ( says I to my Mistress , in Stepney Church-Yard ) what can be the meaning of Brian 's being so melancholy ? When we came to the Half-way-House , he went up to the Side of a Pond , and there he stood while we walked 20 or 30 Yards onwards . Surely ( says I to my Mistress ) the Man is not going to make away with himself ! However , he came up to us in Nightingale-Lane , and asked my Mistress to go round with him to his House , to see if his Wife was got up ; but she , wanted to go to her Sister 's to get a Dram , and would not go with him , so we left him and came Home . Just after Four o'Clock , he came to our House , and staid till Eight in the Morning ; then he went out , and he had not been gone above a Quarter of an Hour , before it was blown about , that he had murder 'd his Wife . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that he was employ 'd by one Harvey , to go Master of a small Vessel , and that he had been that Night with him , from Twelve or One o'Clock , till Two . That he came to his House about half an Hour after One , or near Two , but could not get in ; therefore he intended to have gone to the Sign of the Strong Man , but meeting with Bishop , his Wife , and Oseland , he went with them to the Artichoke , at Milend ; that from thence he came Home again , but still could not get in , therefore he return 'd to Bishop 's , and staid there till nine o'Clock ; then he went home again , and got in at the Window by a Ladder , and found by the Bed , that no one had lain in it that Night ; and that upon coming down Stairs he found somebody had murder 'd his Wife , but there were none of his Goods missing , nor had he been robb 'd of any Thing . Mr. Harvey depos 'd , That the Prisoner , on the 7th of July at Night , left him about One of the Clock , and that he saw no more of him . Mrs. Cole added , that it was near half an Hour after One when she heard the knocking and calling at the Door . Guilty . Death . 12. Edward Barcock , of St Martins in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting Stephen Boughton , Esq ; on the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Hat , value 5 s . August 10 . Mr. Boughton . On the tenth of last Month , about Eleven o'Clock at Night , as I was going home thro ' Long-Acre to Westminster , the Prisoner came up to me , caught hold of each Side of my Collar , and said d - n you , I have got you now , - deliver all you have , or else G - d d - mn you , I 'll murder you ; and upon this , he quitted his left Hand , and took off my Hat . I bent forward , and drew my Sword , between the Prisoner and my self ; then I got hold of the Prisoner 's Left Hand , and declar 'd , if he offer 'd any farther Violence , I would run him thro ' the Body ; and I call 'd the Watch . Then he endeavour 'd to run me up an Alley , and having fast hold of the Right Side of me , he tore my Shirt out of the Collar , and down the Holland . While I call 'd out Murder , I saw another Fellow come up , to whom the Prisoner gave something out of his Hand , but I ca n't swear it was my Hat . When the Watch came up , I charged them with the Prisoner for assaulting and robbing me , and the Prisoner charged the Watch with me , for drawing my Sword in the Street upon a naked Man , and all this while he had hold of my Collar . I deliver 'd my Sword to the Watchmen , and went to St. Martin 's Watch-house to give the Constable Charge of the Prisoner . He , in Vindication of himself , said my Breeches were down , and that I wanted to b - gg - r him . This is the Hat I lost at that Time ; this Watchman afterwards brought it to the Watch-house . John Barber , Watchman . I was within fifty Yards of Mr. Boughton when he cry 'd out Murder 5 or 6 Times . When I went up , the Prisoner had him fast by the Collar , drawing him about . Mr. Boughton 's Hand was thro ' the Hilt of the Sword , with the Point down ; I desired him to deliver his Sword , which he did immediately ; but the Prisoner still kept his Hold and tugg 'd him about . He made no Excuse for himself , 'till he came to the Watch-house ; then he said the Prosecutor took hold of his Private Parts , and that his Breeches were down ; but they were not upon my Oath . Prisoner . Ask him whether the Prosecutor charged me with robbing him before we came to the Watch-house ? Barber . Mr. Boughton was in such a Fright , he hardly knew what he did ; but to the best of my Remembrance , he told me , the Prisoner had robb 'd him of his Hat . When we got to the Watch-house he pretended to come upon the Prosecutor for B - gg - ry . Prisoner . How came I to go to the Watchhouse ? Mr. Boughton . I had hold of him . Barber . He could not help it ; we had so much Help , he could not have made his Escape . Prisoner . Did not Mr. Boughton want to get away ? Barber . Mr. Boughton desired not to be lugg 'd about , and said he would surrender himself to the Watch . When the Prisoner came to the Watchhouse , there happen 'd to be Mr. Rawlinson and 3 other Constables there , who all knew him the Minute they saw him : they gave him the Character of a very vile Fellow , and said he had been drumm 'd out of the Guards . Mr. Boughton . He was drumm 'd out of the Guards for Sodomy . The Prisoner in his Defence said , Mr. Boughton came up to him in the Street , and made use of Words and Actions which signify 'd a vile Intention , upon which he collar 'd him , and then Mr. Boughton drew his Sword . That when the Watch came up he wanted to get away , but that he ( the Prisoner ) did not attempt to escape . Jury We desire the Prosecutor may be asked , whether the Prisoner attempted to make his Escape ? Mr. Boughton I had hold of him , and he had hold of me ; but seeing the Lanthorns coming up , he quitted his hold , and would have got off ; and when he found they were just upon us , he clapp 'd hold of me again . John Godding , knew the Prisoner 6 or 7 Years , and said that he always behav 'd handsomely , and had an Income of 20 l. a Year , as he had heard . John Ellis , a Soldier , gave an Account that the Prisoner was turn 'd out of the Guards for deserting twice ; but that he never heard him charged with Dishonesty . Others deposed to the same Effect , and that they had heard the Prisoner had a small Annuity , paid him half yearly . One of them mention 'd a Gentleman 's Name , of Clement 's Inn , who ( he was inform 'd ) used to pay the Prisoner Money ; but none of them were able effectually to prove it . Guilty . Death . 13. Sarah Woodcock , of St. Giles in the Fields , was indicted , ( with Joseph Blison , and Joseph Meadows , not taken ) for assaulting Thomas Pulpin in a certain Alley , near the King 's Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , value 4 l. a Portugal Piece of Gold , value 36 s. two Guineas , and 9 Shillings in Silver . Aug. 27 Thomas Pulpin . About 11 at Night , Aug . 22. as I was going home , I met the Prisoner and two Men in an Alley that goes into the Cole-Yard , she came up to me , and said I had got Money , and she must have it ; and if I spoke a Word , there were two Men would knock my Brains out . I was afraid of my Life , so I let her take it easily . I felt her Hands in my Pocket ; and when she had done , the two Men call 'd out , - Fiend of Hell , come along . While she was robbing me , they stood about 4 or 5 Yards off . She took from me a Watch , a 36 Shilling Piece of Gold , 2 Guineas , and 9 Shillings in Silver ; ( the Money was in a Purse ) and then she and the two Men ran away together . I was afraid of following them , for Fear of being murder 'd , therefore I went to the first House I found , and told the Man I had been robb 'd . He ask 'd me if I knew the Persons ? I told him , No , I did not ; but I had hear 'd the Woman call 'd Fiend of Hell , by the two Men that were with her . O ! ( says he ) if it was Fiend of Hell that robb 'd you , I can find her out in the Morning ; and in the Morning she was found out , and I am positive she is the Person that robb 'd me . George Lines . Mr. Pulpin came to my House the 22d of August between 12 and 1 at Night , and said he had been robb 'd . I asked him if he knew who robb 'd him , he said the Woman was call 'd Fiend of Hell . O ! says I , I know that Gentlewoman , sit down till Morning , and I will go and see if I can find her . Next Morning I went to a House in Drury-Lane , and called for a Pot of Beer , while I was drinking the Prisoner came in , so I took her , and the Prosecutor said , she was the Woman that had robbed him . She was very drunk when I took her , so I carry 'd her to the Round-house 'till she was sober ; then I had her before Justice Poulson , and he committed her . I heard her own the Robbery before the Justice , but I ca n't tell whether it was reduced into Writing or not . Jury . We desire Pulpin may be asked what Time of Night he was robb 'd ? Pulpin To the best of my Remembrance 't was about 12 o'Clock . I was looking for a Friend that had been in a Quarrel when this happened . Jury . By what Light did you observe her Face ? Pulpin . It was not so dark but I could see her Face very well , I swear she is the Woman that robb 'd me . I ca n't say the Moon shone , but it was very Star-light . Jury . Were there any Lamps near you ? Pulpin . No , but I saw her plainly , and am positive to her . - Lyon . I went with Mr. Lines the next Morning to see for the Prisoner at a House where she lodged in Drury-Lane . While we were there she came in with Betty Davis , and Betty had got a short Cloak , a Shirt , and a check 'd Apron , which she said she had been to buy for the Prisoner . Upon this we sent for Pulpin , and he charg 'd a Constable with her for robbing him . She was searched directly , and 31 s. and 6 d. were taken from her ; and as she was fuddled , she was sent to the Round-house till she was sober , then she was carry 'd before Mr. Poulson , and as we were coming from thence , she desired the Constable to let her have half a Crown , and said Pulpin might have the rest , for it was his Money , and she begg 'd he would be favourable to her . Defence . I met Mr. Pulpin , and he enquired of me if I could tell him where Moll Thompson might be found , she was one that he kept Company with , and he promised to make me drink if I could find her ; so I went to 2 or 3 Places , and at last he carry 'd me to Lines 's House , and he sells Spirituous Liquors - Lines . Mr. Pulpin never brought the Prisoner to my House in his Life as I know of . I never saw her there with him . Guilty , Death . 14.

Jonathan Thomas , of London , was indicted , & c. & c. for deceitfully and traiterously diminishing and filing 9 Pieces of Gold called Guineas , against the Form of the Statute , & c. The Councel for the King observed , that the Prisoner was brought before the Court for an Offence of very great Consequence to the Publick , viz . for diminishing the current Coin of the Kingdom , which was expresly declared High-Treason by the Statute of the V. Eliz . Chap . 11 , on which the Indictment was founded ; so that the Question before the Court was only a Question of Fact , which would be prov 'd by a variety of concurrent Circumstances , as the Defendant had no Accomplice in the Crime with which he was charg 'd . And that the Proof arising from a Number of such Circumstances , was more satisfactory and conclusive , than the positive Testimony of a single Person ; because a great variety of Circumstances ca n't all tally one with another , unless they have their Foundation in Truth , & c. & c. The Evidence having been open 'd , the Witnesses were called . Matthew Martin . I am a Teller at the Bank , and it having been observed for some Time , that abundance of ( what we call ) light Guineas , were paid in by different Porters , we several Times examined and weighed those which were brought by Porters , and finding them always light , we acquainted Mr. Collier the Cashier . He order 'd us to watch the Porters , and accordingly the first Porter that came to pay in Money , and take a Note , I follow 'd , and saw him deliver the Note to the Prisoner . Councel . How many Porters may you have observed to have been employ 'd in this Business ? Martin . Thirty or 40 . Councel . How many have you dogg 'd , and seen go to the Prisoner ? Martin . I believe near 20 . Councel . In what Places did they generally deliver him the Money or Notes ? Martin . At different Coffee-houses and Taverns . Once or twice I have observed the Porter to deliver a Note to him in the Street . Councel . Did the Porters know that they were dogg 'd ? Martin . No , they did not ; and all the Times that I follow 'd the Porters , I never saw any of them deliver a Note , but to the Prisoner alone . I believe within these last three Months I have seen 20 Notes deliver 'd to him in this Manner , of 30 l. and 35 l. Value ; and they generally used to be brought back in a Day or two by Porters , who receiv 'd Money for them . Councel . Does it often happen , when a Man takes out 20 Notes in so short a Time , that they should all of them be so speedily return 'd ? Martin . No ; it does not often happen so . Councel . Do you remember the Note that was given in the Name of Robert Gipton ? Martin . Yes ; it was for 30 l. but I did not receive the Money for this Note . 'T was on Account of this Note the Prisoner was taken , but I was not the Person that took him . He was taken in July ; the particular Day I do n't remember ; - it was several Days after the Date of the Note , and the Note was dated the 10th of July , I saw it deliver 'd to him originally , by the Porter that took it from the Bank . When he was taken this Note was produced to him , and Mr. Franco declar 'd he had it from the Prisoner ; he ( the Prisoner ) then own 'd he had negotiated Notes , but he said , he could not tell who he had this Note from , nor did he know any such Person as Robert Gipton , to whom the Note was made payable . After he was taken up , his Lodgings in Wood-Street were search 'd , where we found 2 Memorandum Books , and this File , in the Prisoner 's Buroe , up one pair of Stairs . He was with us when the Search was made , he produc 'd the Key , open 'd the Buroe himself , to prevent our breaking it open . I remember I took the File myself , from the Bottom of the upper Part of the Buroe . Counc . Did he then know he was taken on Suspicion of filing Guineas ? Martin . Yes ; he had been before the Lord Mayor before . Counc . You say there had been twenty Notes deliver 'd to Porters , in the Space of these three Months last past ; - in what Names were they taken out ? Martin . In many different Names , - not one , in his own Name . Jury . At what Places did you see Porters deliver Notes to the Prisoner ? Martin . At several different Places : - at the Globe-Tavern , Fleet street ; the Chapter Coffee-House , Pater-noster-Row ; Sam 's Coffee-House , and a Coffee-House near his Lodging , in Silver-Street , - Morris 's Coffee-House . Once I saw a Note deliver 'd to him in Aldersgate-Street ; another likewise was deliver 'd to him in the Street , but as I took no Memorandum of it , I ca n't recollect what Street it was . Counc . You say none of these Notes were made out in his Name . Martin . No ; none of them . He has been at the Bank , to transact Business himself , and then he always went by the Name of John Harris . In the Memorandum-Book which I found in his Buroe , there was an Account of the Money he had sent to the Bank , and of the Persons , by whom 't was sent ; though he had told us when we took him , that he kept no Account of Bank Notes . The Memorandums in the Books , I take to be the Prisoner 's Hand-writing ; for I have seen a great deal of his Writing , and he own 'd the Books were his . Counc . You say you did not receive the 30 l. that was paid in , in order to have this Note , payable to Gipton . Martin . No ; it was paid to Mr. Burchall , a Teller at another Table , but I stood by when Mr. Burchall receiv 'd it , and I desired him to let the Money lie by itself , 'till the Porter who brought it , was gone , and then I carry 'd the same Guineas to the Cashier , to be weigh 'd ; while the Porter was gone to the other Part of the Hall , for a Ticket , in Order to have a Note made out ; and nine of them were found deficient . Jury . Were the rest full Weight ? Martin . We did not weigh them exactly , but only to a five Penny-weight . I do n't doubt but there were more light one 's among them , and the best of these Nine , were 8 or 9 Grains short . The Note that was made out for the Porter that brought this Money , was in the Name of Robert Gipton , and I follow 'd him , and saw him deliver it to the Prisoner , ( I think it was ) in Fleet Street . As to the File , it had the Appearance of Gold in the Teeth of it , when I took it . It is in the same Condition , as it was when I found it , and has never been but one Night out of my Custody , and then it was in the Cashier 's Drawer . Counc . Is it common for a Person to take Notes out , in any Name but their own ? Martin . 'T is done sometimes ; but 't is not common . Counc . Is the Porter here that took out Gipton 's Money ? Martin . I believe he is not . Prisoner . When was the first Time you observ 'd a Porter to bring light Money , in order to have a Note ? Martin . I think , about a Twelve-month ago . Prisoner . Where 's the Money you first observ 'd to be light ? Martin . Paid away , I believe . Prisoner . Where 's all the rest ? Martin . Circulated in my Cash , and paid away , 'till the Fraud grew rank . Mr. Burchall . I am a Teller in the Bank of England . On the 10th of July , a Porter brought 30 l to me , and I gave him a Ticket in order to his having a Note made out for the Money , in the Name of Robert Gipton ; but suspecting that he came from the Person that had transacted Business by several Porters , and the Paper he brought being in the same Hand with those brought by other Porters , I took Care not to blend the Money , and got Mr. Waite to weigh it . There was 28 Guineas , a Half Guinea , and 1 s. 6 d. and nine of the Guineas were found too light . They were weigh 'd while the Porter was gone to another Table to have his Note made out , and I think Mr. Martin was present when they were weigh 'd . We did not secure the Porter then , because we thought the properest Time would be , when he came to have the Note paid . Counc . You say the Papers which the Porters brought with the Money , were always in the same Hand writing ? Burchall . Yes ; always in the same Hand , but never in the same Name . Counc . Explain yourself concerning the Papers , which the Porters brought with the Money , to entitle them to receive a Note . Burchall . A Porter , when he brings Money from any Person , and is to receive a Bank Note for it , he brings a Ticket with the Person 's Name that he comes for , and the Sum is set down that he brings with him ; we see that the Money is right , and then a Note is made out for it , payable to the Name in the Porter 's Paper ; which Paper , the Porter always takes back with him to his Employer , that he may be satisfied the Bank Note is right as to the Sum . And it had been a common Observation we made , that all the Notes the Porters brought were in the same Hand . John Beresford . This Note , payable to Robert Gipton , was made out at the bank the Day it is dated . I enter 'd it in the Cash-Book , and this is my Hand , ( upon the Note . ) I countersign 'd it , and deliver 'd it to the Cashier . Mr. Martin I saw this Note making out ; it was deliver 'd to the Porter , and I saw the Porter deliver it , or something like it , to the Prisoner . 'T was deliver 'd in the Street , and I stood on the other Side of the Way . Mr. Waite . I weigh 'd the Guineas , and found nine of them too light . I have them here . Here is a Guinea of the late King 's ; Date , 1719 , eight Grains , that is 16 d. wanting . Another of the late King 's , 1722. twelve Grains wanting , that 's 2 s. Another of his present Majesty 's , 1737. wants 8 Grains , about 16 d. Councel . 'T is impossible that should be worn so much . Mr. Waite . Here 's another of the late King 's 1726 , wants 7 Grains , that is about 14 d. Here is one of King Charles II 's , wants 12 Grains , 2 s. - but perhaps there might be 3 or 4 Grains lost by the Wear of this . Here 's one of K. James the IId 's , 11 Grains wanting . But here is one of King William 's which wants 13 Grains , that is 2 s. 2 d. Councel . This has indeed been rubb 'd to its inmost Ring . Mr. Waite . Here is one of Queen Anne 's which wants 8 Grains , and another of Queen Anne 's that wants 10 Grains ; and these are the very identical Guineas , paid in for Robert Gipton 's Note of 30 l. I was by when Mr. Burchal took them , and I weigh 'd them directly . The rest of them might want 2 or 3 Grains , or thereabouts . When I shew 'd them to the Prisoner , he said , he never saw them before . In my Opinion , the Deficiency plainly appears to have been made by filing . Thomas Adams . I live with Messieurs Abram and Jacob Franco : I receiv 'd this Note from the Prisoner on the 27th of July . I am sure 't is the same Note that I receiv 'd from him . He bought 3 Bags of Cochineal of us , and gave us that Note in Payment . I took Notice of the Name ( Gipton ) when I took it , and said , it was a comical Name . But however I enter 'd it , as receiv 'd , and my Master 's Son enter 'd it in the Bill of Parcel 's Book . Abram Adams , Porter . I know the Prisoner very well : I have been employ 'd by him to carry Guineas to the Bank . And from the 15th of November 1734 , to the 12th of April 1736 , I have gone 17 Times for him , and carry 'd always , - from between 20 to 30 l. The last Time was the 12th of April 1736 , and I paid the Money at this Gentleman 's Table : He said he did not like the Money , and took the Scales to weigh it ; when he had done , he said there were 13 Guineas too light , and he had a good Mind to stop the Money . He asked me , who I brought it from ? I told him , from a Gentleman that was at the Castle in Woodstreet ; and after he had paused some Time , he bid me take the Guineas away - I should have no Bill , and order 'd me to tell the Man that sent me , that the next Time he sent such Guineas , they should be stopp 'd . I carry 'd the Money back to the Prisoner , and told him what the Gentleman said ; and from that Time to this , he never sent me with any more Guineas to the Bank . Councel . Did you know who the Prisoner was , or where he liv 'd ? Adams . No ; the People at the Castle , from whence he used to send me , were often wondering who he was , and thought it very strange , that he should never carry his Money himself . Councel . What Name did he go by ? Adams . I did not know his Name ; - we called him , - our Bank Master ; but from the Time I told him what they said of his Money at the Bank , I lost my Bank-Master . John Robe . I am a Porter at the Bull-Head , the Corner of Smithfield . I have carry 'd Money to the Bank for the Prisoner a great many Times ; - I believe 30 Times or more . I have done it for him two or three Years , and have carry 'd 20 , 25 , and 30 l. The most I ever went with at a Time was 35l . I never knew his Name , nor whence he came , nor where he liv 'd ; but his Method was , to come to our Corner , and carry me from thence to the Bear and Ragged Staff in Smithfield , where he gave me the Money . Counc . You never asked him why he did not go himself ? Robe . No , he gave 6 d. a Time , and I was glad of the Job . When I had got a Bank Note for his Money , I used to deliver it to him sometimes at the Bear and Ragged Staff , and sometimes he would order me to bring it to him at a Coffee-house in Aldersgate street Counc . You say you never knew his Name ? Robe . No , none of us knew his Name , and we must call him by some Name or other ; so we call 'd him our Bank Master . Counc . Did he never order any Notes to be made in the Name of Jonathan Thomas ? Robe . No , never . I remember he has order 'd Notes to be made payable to the Names of Holmes and Holt , and Austin ; we had a great many Names , and perhaps once in a Week or Fortnight we might have the same Name over again . Prisoner . Was any of the Money you carry 'd ever scrupl 'd at the Bank ? Robe . No , 't was good Money for ought I know . I have carry 'd many a 100 l for the Grasiers and Salesmen in Smithfield to the Bank . I have carry 'd a great deal of Money for Mr. Pym , and have taken a Note for it in my own Name . Thomas Turner . I am a Porter . I know the Prisoner very well , I have gone these two Years and a half for him , from the Bear and ragged Staff with Money to the Bank , and have brought him Notes for 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35 l. sometimes I have gone once a Week , sometimes twice ; but I never received any Note in the Prisoner 's Name . When I had got the Note , I used to carry it to him sometimes to Sutton 's Coffee-house , and sometimes to Dolley 's in Aldersgate street . I believe I have carry 'd Money for him 15 or 20 Times , and I never found there was any Scruple made in receiving the Money . I have carry 'd Money for Graziers and Salesmen ; their Money and the Prisoner 's was all alike I thought . I have carry 'd Money to the Bank for Mr. Pym , and have taken a Note in my own Name . 'T is about 2 Months ago since I carry 'd any for the Prisoner . John Bickerstaff I am a Ticket Porter , and ply at the Bull Head in Smithfield , I know the Prisoner very well ; within this Year and half I have carry 'd Money to the Bank for him about twenty Times . The Sums were from 20 to 30 l. and I have carry 'd the greatest part of the Notes to him at the Bear and ragged Staff ; and sometimes to Dolley 's and Sutton 's Coffee-houses . I did not know his Name till he was taken up ; . we always called him our Bank-Master , and I am sure I never received any Money or Notes for him in the Name of Thomas . Tho Hobbs I am a Ticket Porter , and ply in Little-Britain , I have been employed by the Prisoner these 2 or 3 Years , to fetch Money from the Bank ; I never carry 'd any in . Sometimes have gone twice in a Week ; but he seldom fall 'd sending me once a Week or a Fortnight , and I always received the Money in the Name of Charles Smith . David Kingstone . I am a Ticket Porter in Aldermanbury . I have paid Money into the Bank for the Prisoner a great many Times ; - 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 , and once 36 l. that was the last Time but one He has frequently given me the Money at the 3 Nuns in Aldermanbury , and has appointed me to bring him the Note , sometimes to a Coffee-house in Aldersgate-street , and sometimes to another Place . The last Money was 30 l. which I carry 'd on the 20th of June . I knew his Name was Jonathan Thomas , and I used to wonder why he never paid any of the Money in at the Bank in his own Name . Counc . How came you to know his Name ? Kingston . I saw him once go down into a Wine Cellar in Aldermanbury , and when he was gone , I asked who he was ? The Man that kept the Cellar told me his Name was Thomas ; and that he had been a Holland Trader , but had left off Business for some Time . After this , I used to enquire for him at Coffee-houses , ( when I had got Money for him ) by his own Name . I have seen the Money I carry 'd to the Bank paid away before my Face , and do not remember that any of it was ever scrupled . William Mitchell . I ply in Aldersgate street , and have been ( within this Year and half ) 20 Times ( or more ) employ 'd by the Prisoner to carry Guineas to the Bank , which they have told over , and have seen them paid away again directly . John Lant . I ply in Aldermanbury , and have received for the Prisoner from the Bank at several Times 170 l. I have received likewise 30l . at Sir Francis Child 's for him . The last Money I received for him at the Bank I was to pay him in Guild-hall , where he said , I should find him walking about . Accordingly I found him there , and we went into the Sheriff 's Court , where he told it over , and half a Guinea was missing . I desired him to let me know where he liv 'd , and I would leave half a Crown at his House as I cou 'd spare it , 'till the half Guinea was paid . No Matter where I live , says he , I 'll call upon you ; so he paid me 6 d. for the Jobb , but would not inform me where he liv 'd . Richard Earl , another Porter in Aldermanbury , had carry 'd at several Times 7 Notes to the Bank , all which he received for the Prisoner in the Name of John Chambers ; which he took to be his right Name , and had brought the Money to him , sometimes to a Coffee-house , sometimes to the Baptist's-Head , and sometimes in Guild-hall . These 7 Notes were produced in Court , and this Witness swore the Prisoner wrote the Name , ( John Chambers ) upon every one of them in his Presence . Mr. North . Upon apprehending the Prisoner , and the Design to search his House , the Prisoner desired he might go with [ Text unreadable in original . ] us , open the Things himself . Accordingly Mr. Sandwell and I , Mr. Martin and the Prisoner , we to his Lodging . The first Thing we opened was his Desk ; in the uppermost Drawer of the Scrutore were these two Memorandum Books , and in the same Drawer I found this File , in which there are Particles of something like Gold . After this , I was informed the Prisoner had a Ware-house , and a Cellar under it in Hare-Court in Aldersgate street ; upon searching it we found ( in the Warehouse ) only a few empty Casks , and some Lumber ; not so much as a Crevise to let in Light ; even the Key-hole of an old Door was stopp 'd . In the Cellar we found a Breach in the Brick-Wall , as if a Filing Board had been set up in that Place , and a square Trough with a Ledge round it , and something like Charcoal Dust in it ; we found likewise a Lamp , and the Wall black , ( as we apprehended ) from the burning of a Lamp or Candle against it . The Dust in the Trough we got wash 'd , and then try 'd it with Aqua Fortis ; this is what was left , and it has the Appearance of Gold . The Place is so enclosed , that no one can look into it ; there is indeed a slight Partition which divides off a Part of the Necessary-house , for the Use of the People above Stairs , but is in such a Manner , that they ca n't see into the Prisoner 's Cellar . Mr. Moore . The Prisoner is the reputed Occupier of this Warehouse and Cellar . The House belongs to Capt . Innocent ; I have liv 'd there two Years and a half , and he has been the Possessor of it so long ; during which Time , I never saw any one but the Prisoner go in , or out . Mr. North . Upon examining the Memorandums found at his Lodging , we observ 'd the Names of several Porters set down , which have now appeared ; it seems to be an Account of the Transactions of the Porters , and the Days of the Month when they were sent ; among others , - here 's 30 Robert Gipton , - Charles Betts . Mr. Sandwell . I was present when the File and the Memorandums were found , at the Prisoner 's Lodging in Wood-street . Upon Messieurs Franco being question 'd about this Note of Gipton 's , they directed me to the Prisoner , and he told me , he knew nothing of it , and that he made no Memorandums of Business transacted at the Bank . The Note was carry 'd to the Bank , the 28th of July , and the Monday or Tuesday following , I ask 'd him about it , but he said he knew not how he came by it . I desired him before he was taken up , to let me know who he dealt with , and in what Goods ; but he huffed and asked what that was to me : I gave him to next Day to recollect , and accordingly Mr Martin and I went next Morning to his Lodgings ; he was not at Home , but we met him in the Street and took him . When we search 'd the Warehouse , we found only Lumber ; but we observ 'd a Stove with an Iron Door to it , which will melt Gold as well as a Furnace ; and there was likewise a Trap-door into the Cellar . By the Stove , we found an earthen Pan , in which were Grains of the meltings of Gold , among other Dust . This was wash 'd by Mr . Duck , and after it had been try 'd with Aqua Fortis , there was about twenty Grains of Gold . We took up about a Quart of Dirt , which Duck wash 'd , and in it we found Filings of Gold . Some Days after this , I went again , with Mr. Doiley , the Constable , ( I never went alone ) and looking about the Cellar with the Candle , I thought I saw some Gold Dust in the Bottom of a matted Chair , so I knock 'd the Dust out into a Paper , and Mr. Hayward , the Refiner , try 'd it in a Crucible with Argol , but nothing was produced . I was surprised I should be so deceiv 'd , and went again to look at the Chair ; still I thought there was Gold Dust in it , and I beat more Dust out of it , which Mr . Duck wash 'd , and after it had been try 'd with Aqua Fortis , and had gone through the Fire , it yeilded about sixteen Grains . This was got from the second dusting of the Chair , and in order to be assured of its being Gold , I carry 'd it to the Mint , where an extraordinary Fire was made , and here it is , assay 'd , and the Assay-Master 's Report . Mr. Hayward , Refiner . This assay 'd Piece is fine Gold , of 24 Carracts . Standard Gold , is but of 22 Carracts . This , though the finest of Gold , might possible have been taken off Guineas , because it 's having undergone these Operations , may have consum 'd the Allay , and brought it above Standard . Mr. Sandwell . This is the same Gold we found in the Dust ; I stood by the Assay-Master while he try 'd it . Prisoner . I would ask whether he , or some other , did not carry some Dirt got in the Mint , and scatter it upon the Chair . Sandwell . No , I did not , nor do I know any body that did . Mr. Moore . Though I have liv 'd two Years and a Half in the House , yet I never saw any Business carry 'd on in the Prisoner 's Warehouse . I have heard indeed , that he dealt in Brandy and Rum , before the Commencement of the Act against retailing such Liquors , but I never saw any Thing of it , nor any Goods of any Sort ever carried in , or out ; nor did I ever see any Body go in , or out , but the Prisoner alone . Part of the necessary House is divided off into his Cellar , and the Boards are a little loose . When I have been at the Vault I have heard a small Noise , like Filing in the Cellar , and this about half a Score Times , I believe ; but I never saw what he was doing . The Neighbours have wonder 'd what he did in that Warehouse , but I had no Suspicion of this Business . Prisoner . At such Times as you heard this Filing in the Cellar , can you say I was in it ? Moore . I do n't know who was then in the Cellar . 'T was not like the Noise of Filing in a Smith 's Shop , but like the Filing of something small . William Plevy . The Prisoner has rented the Warehouse and Cellar between 3 and 4 Years . At first , he dealt in Brandy and Rum ; but since the Act , I do n't know what Business he has followed . I live over-against the Warehouse , and have seen him go in , and out , several Times a Day , but never with any body with him . Whenever he went in , he lock 'd himself in , and I have observ 'd him to push against the Door to see if 't was fast . I was with those that search 'd the Dust , and told them , there was Gold in the Trough , and in the Bottom of the Chair . I used to wonder how he liv 'd . Mary Moore confirm 'd Mr. Moore 's Evidence ; and said she had heard a Noise in the Cellar , like a small Filing , but she did not know who was at such Times in the Cellar . She had seen the Prisoner go in and out a hundred Times , but never any one else , nor did she ever see any Goods carried in or out . And that the Prisoner generally staid there , a great while at a Time , always lock 'd up ; and tho ' there might be Light in the Cellar , yet she never could see any glimpse of it . Prisoner . Is there no other Apartment joins to the Cellar ? Moore . No dwelling House ; the next Building is a Stable , - and it could not be the Horses that were filing . Mary Holland gave exactly the same Account . Mr. Hayward , Refiner . I have bought Gold of the Prisoner , but not within these Twelvemonths , and have sold him 50 or 60 Pound's-worth of Pieces of Eight ; ( Portugal Money ) The Gold he sold me was melted into small Bars , about 3 , 4 , or 5 ozs . weight , and might be sometimes a little better , and sometimes a little worse , than Standard . The Portugal Money we esteem as Standard Gold . I have dealt with him 3 or 4 Years . Mr. Cook , Refiner . The Prisoner has several Times brought Ingots of Gold to my Counting-House to sell . Within this Year , or Year and Half , I have bought three or four Times of him Ingots , about 8 , 10 , or 12 ozs . weight That which comes from the Indies , is in Horseshoes , of about 20 or 24 ozs . weight . I took the Prisoner to be a Man of Reputation . George Steed . The Prisoner has brought Gold to me to sell , and I have sold him Pieces of Eight . I took him to be an honest Man . Brian Russel . I am an Ironmonger ; and have sold the Prisoner , Files and Crucibles ( for melting Metal ) these three Years . The Files were two-Penny Handfiles , smooth on one Edge , Pillow Files , and other small Files ; midding and small Cut . I have sold him about 20 Crucibles , - they are apt to break in the Fire . I sold him Files 6 or 7 Weeks ago ; and likewise before the Spirituous Liquors went down . Prisoner . The Crucibles I used to turn Lead into Dust . Mr. Russel . The Files he had of me , were mostly such as are used by Watchmakers . Defence . When these People , my Lord , call 'd upon me about this 30 l. Bank Note , I told them it might possibly have been in my Possession ; for I had several Notes upon Goldsmiths , and upon the Bank , in my Possession , and did not know the Names of any one Person mentioned in those Notes ; only I look 'd upon it as necessary to take some Account of the Numbers , and the like , in case of any Accident . As to the Occurrences in the Pocket-Books , I do n't know on what Occasion I made the Memorandums ; - some were made a long Time ago . As to my receiving Money from the Bank , in many different , and perhaps fictitious Names , ( from whence They would infer I clipp 'd the Money I receiv 'd ) the Reason was this ; I have a Load of Debts upon me , and among my Creditors , is a Gentleman , a Director of the Bank ; and Mr. Nathaniel Gould ( lately deceas 'd ) was another . This was the Reason I conceal 'd my Name , - lest my Creditors should fall on me , thinking I had more Money than really I was possess 'd of . I own I have sold Ingots of Gold , - I deal with India Ships ; and as to the Pieces of Eight which I bought , I did that with an Intent to go to India . There is ( Gentlemen ) a very great Difference in the Value of Gold , - I have sold Gold to Mr. Cook , worth no more than 3 l. 10 s. per Oz and I have bought Gold 18 d. or 2 s. per Oz . worse than Standard . As to the Gold found in the Cellar , - I hope ( Gentlemen ) you 'll think I know nothing of it . Would any one put Gold among Dirt , or in the Bottom of a Chair ? As for the File they found , - I had Occasion to file a Lock , and when I had done , I threw it into a Drawer where some loose Leaf-Gold and some Bees-Wax lay . Mr. Sandwell . There was some Leaf-Gold in one of the Drawers , but 't was not in the Drawer where we found the File . Prisoner . As to the Bank-Note , they do n't swear it was the Note that the Porter deliver 'd me , - Mr. Martin only says , the Porter deliver 'd me a Paper . - I never saw the Note , but at Grocers hall Mr. James Hewey . I have known the Prisoner four or five Years ; I have been at his House , and he has been at mine , and I always took him to be an honest Man , and never suspected his getting Money in an irregular Way . I live in Aldermanbury . I have lent him 70 l within these two Months , and would have chang 'd a Bank Note for him at any Time . I knew nothing of his Way of Business my self , only I have heard he dealt in Cochineal . When he dealt in Brandies , I heard he had a Warehouse , but I never knew where it was . Mr. Shaw . I have known the Prisoner about twenty Years ; I took him for an honest Man : he was the Son of as worthy a Man , as any in the Kingdom of Ireland . He had 2000l . with his Wife , out of a Quaker 's Family , and he himself rented an Estate of 150 l. a Year . I was concern 'd with him , to carry a Ship loaden with Lath and Pantiles from Rotterdam to Dublin , and he gave up his Commission , because he saw there would be Loss upon the Voyage . He came here on Account of Losses in Ireland . These brought him to England , and while he was here , I imagined he subsisted on his paternal Estate As to his Warehouse , I did not know he had one 'till now . - That was a Secret to me . William Trotter . I do n't know much of Mr. Thomas . I never saw him 'till about 4 or 5 Years ago I have heard he dealt in Brandy and Rum , and he serv 'd a Publick House which I used with those Liquors , about 3 or 4 Years ago . I heard he had a Warehouse , but I did not know where it was , nor how he has subsisted this last twelve Months . Nicholas Hague . I have known him between 4 or 5 Years . He bore ( I thought ) the Character of a very honest Man . I never had any Dealings with him , nor do I know how he liv 'd these 2 or 3 Years . I thought he had used the 'Change ; and had traded and bought Bargains . I heard he had a Warehouse somewhere , but I never saw him buy or sell any thing in my Life . Chase Wormlayton spoke to the same Effect . Hannah Burges . I have known him 2 Years , and bought Liquors and Jars of Snuff of him . I have help 'd him to Customers , some of them ( indeed ) have been but very indifferent ones . In his Warehouse ( 't is a dark Place ) there formerly stood a dark dirty Board a Yard long , propp 'd up with a Stick where Drawers and Funnels used to stand . I live over-against him : He has taken Pounds of me , and I have help 'd him to take Pounds . I have bought Snuff of him within these 6 Months ; Stone Jars that held 7 lb . and Bottles of 2 lb . I never saw any body go in beside himself , but he has desired me , if any one came , to take a Message for him . Charles Brown , Upholster . I have known the Prisoner 5 Years ; he always bore a good Character . I did not take him to be a Clipper , but thought he had Money enough to carry on a good Trade , and I believe he carry 'd on Trade in as honest a Way as other Merchants do . John Smith , George Smith , and Thomas Smith , gave the Prisoner a good Character . Prisoner . I have sold several hundred Pounds worth of Pieces of Eight , and Mr. Waite has given me a Note for the Money . Mr. Waite . I never saw him ( as I know of ) in my Life till I saw him at my Lord-Major 's . William Holmes , a Porter , had carry 'd a great deal of Money to the Bank for the Prisoner , which was never scrupled , and the Prisoner always paid him for the Job very honestly . - But he neither knew his Name , nor where he liv 'd . William Dow , Thomas Philips , and John Chaddock , gave him a good Character , and thought he liv 'd by turning a Penny in an honest Way . Mary Green , ( with a large File ) The Prisoner bought the Files for Lead , to file it small , and to Powder . They were common Files , - here 's one of them ; the Prisoner , ( my Master ) always supply 'd me with Files . Counc . And where did you use to work ? Green . At my own Lodgings in Fire-street . The last Time I work 'd for him , was , - a Month ago , I am sure - It might be more than a Month , - I am not sure . I do n't know what Use the Lead was for , when it was fil 'd . Counc . And how much was you to to be paid for your Labour ? Green . I was not for making any Bargain , - I do n't know , - 3 d a Pound I was to have - I am sure I was above a Week a filing Lead for him . Counc . Have you been us 'd to this Employment ? Green . I have done a great deal ; but I do n't know what it was for . I have done a dozen Pound , and I believe I might be a Fortnight about it . Counc . How much had you for doing it ? Green . Five Shillings . - No , three Shillings . There might be a Matter of 12 or 14 lb . of it . I put it into a Vice and fil 'd it , and then gave it to him . Counc Here , - did you ever use such a File as this ? ( shewing the File found in the Prisoner 's Burean . ) Green . No , - but 't is according to the Bigness of the Lead . Counc . How long have you carry 'd on this Business of filing Lead ? Green . Not long . I was a Fortnight about one Piece ; they said it was fit for many Things , - very fit for sodering . I am sure I have worn out 2 or 3 Files upon one Piece - But then they were not new Files . Counc . Where do you live ? Green . At Mr. Lewis 's , at the White-Lyon and Three Pidgeons in Fore-street Counc . Have you ever fil 'd Lead for any body but the Prisoner ? Green . No ; only for the Prisoner ; he taught me the Business . I was a Fortnight a filing , I am sure . - 't was heavy , - very heavy , - common Lead , - nothing else . Prisoner . Why did not you bring the Lead with you ? The Jury found the Prisoner guilty . Death . 23 Sarah Avery , was indicted for stealing a Linnen Shift , value 18 d. 3 China Cups , value 6 d. a Brass Candlestick , value 6 d. and 4 s. in Money , the Property of Mungo Laws . August 5 .

On the 7th of August , between 11 and 12 in the Forenoon , the Prisoner , and another young Fellow , came into my House . The Man at the Bar said he had been riding hard , and was gall 'd , so he desired me to spread him a Bit of Diaculum Plaister ; which I did , and he gave me 3 d. for it . They were no sooner out of the House , but I miss 'd my Hat ; upon which , I immediately went after them , and took the Prisoner , with my Hat under the Lining of his Coat . He begg 'd I would use him civilly , but I charged a Constable with him , and carry 'd him before Capt . Margets , who committed him . Prisoner . The Person that was with me in this Fact , was Robert Ramsey , the Evidence against Cross and , in the Business of the Forgery upon Mr. Hoare . I made my self an Evidence , and put Fluellin and Ramsey into my Information . Guilty 10 d . [ Whipping . See summary . ] 28. William Cunnington , was indicted for assaulting and ravishing Ann Williams , against her Will , & c . June 20 . Ann Williams , about 12 Years old , gave an Account that she ran away from her Mamma , and the Prisoner 's Wife sent 2 Girls to carry her to their Lodging , where she found the Prisoner alone , who perswaded her to lie down ; with Relation to what pass 'd afterwards , she express 'd her self in Terms requisite to the finding the Prisoner guilty . Martha Gay . The Girl 's Mother , confirm 'd some Part of the Child 's Evidence , and gave a long Account of the Condition she found her in , and the Means she made use of for her Recovery from the Foul Disease . Hope Green , and Ann Raymond , spoke something to the same Effect . Mr. Green , Apothecary , depos 'd , that he made up the Medicines as for a Venereal Case . Jenny Wademan and Margaret Norman deposed , that the Girl used to lie out o'nights frequently in Drury Lane , and Covent Garden , and that she told them , Gentlemen used to give her 6 d. and a Dram . William Abbey , 13 Years of Age , declar 'd that Nan Williams call 'd him to play with her , and gave him the foul Disease , and one Wells a Soldier swore , he knew how to treat a Venereal Patient , and that the Boy was then under his Care . Acquitted . 29. Mary Neale , was indicted for High Treason , in filing and diminishing 10 Pieces of Gold , called Guineas , against the Form of the Statute , & c . The Evidence to fix the Fact upon the Prisoner was George Mason , who lived near Holy Well Mount , to whom the Prisoner was a hired Servant at 5 l. a Year . From his Testimony it appeared , that she used to edge the Guineas , after he had fil 'd off what he thought proper . The Discovery was made by the Evidence 's sending the Prisoner to Mr . Duck , a Watch Case Maker , with a Box of Gold Filing , ( seal 'd up ) in Order to be melted down . Duck suspected the Gold , and acquainted the Officers of the Mint , who waited for the Prisoner 's Return for her Gold , and so she was seized ; but the Evidence not being satisfactory to the Jury , she was acquitted . 30. George Whalley , of St. Michael Crooked-Lane , was indicted for the Murder of Hannah his Wife , by giving her with a Clasp Knife a mortal Wound , on the left side of the Head , of the length of one such and a half , and of the Depth of one Inch , of which she languished from the 10th of June , to the 6th of July , and then dy 'd . He was a 2d Time indicted by Vertue of the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Eliz . Dur . The Yard that belongs to the Prisoner 's House and our Yard join together , they are parted by a thin Wainscoat Partition , and there is a loose Board that lifts up between the 2 Yards On the 10th of June I was in our own Yard , and heard the Deceased say , she would not be lock 'd into the Kitchen . I listened , and heard the Prisoner curse and swear at her in a violent Manner , then he shut her and himself into the Yard , and told her she had robb 'd him of all he had , and that he had not a Farthing to help himself with . She told him she had not , and the Quarrel encreasing , I lifted up the loose Board , and saw him take Hold of her Shoulder , and pull off a Handkerchief which she had upon her Neck ; then she cry 'd out Murder , and I observed a large Clasp Knife in his Hand upon her Shoulder . This is the Knife , and the Blood is still upon it . I was not above a Yard from him , and saw him plainly cut her across the Shoulder ; then he moved his Hand higher , and cut her in the Neck ; and then he moved it again , and cut her nearer her Ear . After he had cut her in this Manner , he open 'd the Kitchen Door , and push 'd her into the Kitchen . Our Sink likewise is parted from theirs by some slight Boards , and when I ran to alarm our Family , I saw her leaning over the Sink , and bleeding into it in a very violent Manner . When the Neighbours came in , he open 'd the Door and ran away . I have often heard him abuse and curse her , and never heard her give him any Provocation . This was the 10th of June between 5 and 6 in the Afternoon . Nathaniel Harris . On the 10th of June , when I came Home to Dinner , ( I live in the same House ) the Prisoner was cursing and swearing at his Wife , because a Gentleman that had got his Money , would not let him have it again , but had told him he would make him knuckle down to his Taw . The Prisoner told her , the Gentleman wanted him to go into the Country , away from his Wife , but he said he would not go , for they shou 'd not live together long , and she would die first . He very frequently cursed and abused her , - the House was never at Peace for him . He has been in the Counter before , for abusing her . I told him I would hang myself if I was he , no , ( he said ) he wou 'd not ; so I went from Dinner between 1 and 2 , and saw no more of it . Prisoner . I was overcome by her aggravating me . Joseph Barber . The poor unfortunate Woman , was my particular Acquaintance . When I heard the Prisoner had cut her Throat , I went to see her , and found it true . Her Head was wrapped up in Cloaths , and she was very bloody . Seeing her in this Condition , I ran for a Surgeon , that she might have proper Care taken of her . Then hearing that the Prisoner was at Brown 's Coffee-House in Fenchurch-Street , I went to him , and he call 'd me vile Rogue , and said , I had got his Money . On Sunday I went to see the Deceased , and she desired me to do her Justice ; and on Monday , I appear 'd against him before the Lord-Mayor . Q . How long was this before her Death ? Dun . She liv 'd a Month after the Thing was done . Barber . When she was given over , and her Case was judg 'd desperate , and when I thought she knew nobody , she grasped me by the Hand , and pull 'd me down towards her , as she lay in Bed , and told me , - the vile Rogue had killed her , and desired me to do her Justice She died on Thursday , and this was on Tuesday or Wednesday . Prisoner . That Man has got my Plate . Barber . I am a poor Man , and have been at a great deal of Charge . Mary Hignal . I liv 'd on the same Floor with the Deceased , ( Mrs. Harding ) she chose that Name , and did not care to be called by the Prisoner 's The Morning this happen 'd , I went into the Kitchen , and heard him call the Deceased a great many Bitches . I reprov 'd him , and he call 'd me Bitch , and told me , if I did not be gone , he would murder me . Upon this , I went to the Door of my own Room , and heard him continue to abuse her ; after some Time , she went up two or three Stairs , toward another Apartment ; he got hold of her to pull her down , and she clung to the Bannisters of the Stairs ; but he kick 'd her under the Arm , tore her down Stairs , and kick 'd her again on the Breast . While she stood in the Passage , he went into the Kitchen , and bid her come in ; she refused , and said he had got a Knife , and had some ill Design against her . He said he had none , but I heard a Knife clasp . Then he went down Stairs , and was in and out all Day . But about six in the Evening , he came into the Kitchen again , and spit in my Face , and I spit in his Face , and went out . Immediately the Prisoner shut himself in , with his Wife , and I run up to Harris 's Room , and said , I believ 'd the Man was going to kill his Wife . Upon this , Mrs. Harris and I , came down , and heard the Deceased cry - Murder , in the Yard ; but I could neither get to them , nor see them ; and being in a very great Fright , I ran down , and went into a Chandler 's Shop , and told the People , the Prisoner had murder 'd his Wife . They said , perhaps I might be mistaken ; I ran up Stairs again , to see if I could get into the Kitchen , and I met the Prisoner coming down Stairs into the Alley , with one Hand bloody , and the other in his Pocket . When I got into the Kitchen , I found Mrs. Harding ( the Deceased ) leaning upon her Hand , and bleeding very much . I believe I saw a Gallon of Blood which she had lost . Barber . The lower Part of the Prisoner 's House is a Warehouse ; and there is a Pair of Stairs that goes from the Alley up into the upper Part of the House . The Kitchen and the Yard is up one pair of Stairs , and the Yard is pav 'd and runs over the Warehouse . She had a Cut under one of her Breasts ; another cross the other Breast ; these were not very deep ; one in her Throat , so deep , that every Time she drank , her Wind-pipe might be seen . Another by her Ear , which was very fatal ! There was another Gash on the back-part of her left Shoulder , and another towards the back-part of the right Shoulder ; She had seven Wounds in all . At first , she thought she should have got over in , but the Night before she dy 'd , and the next Morning , all she crav 'd was , that every one would do her Justice , for she had got her Death 's Wound . Cristopher Bradshaw The Prisoner on the 10th of June , between 5 and 6 in the Evening , pass 'd by me in Mincing-Lane , in a great Hurry . Two Boys were pursuing him , and calling out , - for God 's Sake stop that Man , - he has murder 'd his Wife Upon this , I pursu 'd him , and took him just entring into Billiter Square , and told him I was a Constable and would detain him 'till I was satisfied of the Truth of what the Boys told me . He begg 'd I would not believe them , and desired me to take a Bottle or two of Wine with him ; but seeing both his Hands bloody , I asked him how they came so ? He told me he had been carrying a Lamb 's Head Home . By this Time , the Boys came up , and said , - that was the Man that had cut his Wife 's Throat . Upon which I carry 'd him to Brown 's Coffee House , in Fenchurch-Street , where he was secur 'd while I went to enquire if the Thing was true . When I came to his House , I found it so , and saw Mr. Merrit , the Surgeon , dressing her Wounds , so I came back and took him before the Lord Mayor , and he committed him . He had this Clasp Knife , bloody , and a great Sum of Money in his Pocket when he was taken . Mr. Merrit , Surgeon . On the 10th of June I was called to dress the Deceased 's Wounds , she had received 6 Wounds , one upon the Sternum or Breast Bone , one on the left Breast , one by the side of the Wind-pipe , one on the right Shoulder , another on the left , and one near the left Ear ; which Wound was the Occasion of all the fatal Symptoms that ensu 'd ; for the Puncture or stabbing in that Place had open 'd an Artery . This Wound was triangular , as if the Knife had been jobb 'd in , and then drawn along , 't was pretty deep , but when an Artery is cut , we never make Use of a Probe . The Consequence of this Wound , was such an Effusion of Blood , as Nature at her Years ( and I believe she was about 60 ) could not bear . She was lost by the great Effusion of Blood . She died the 6th of July , which was 26 Days after the Accident happened . This Wound bled internally , and we made an opening to draw off that Blood , by which Means she liv 'd 26 Days , and then died , by being exhausted of so much Blood . Mr. Doughty , Apothecary . After Mr. Merrit had dressed the Wounds , I was sent for to the Deceased . I found ( from the great Effusion of Blood ) her Pulse languid , and an Inflammation on the Glands of her Throat , for which I ordered her proper Medicines . She had likewise a symptomatic Fever , and was bad o'Nights . I call 'd in a Physician , not caring to trust to my own Judgment , and at length the Fever Intermitted , and we had Hopes of her Recovery ; but in the principal Wound there was but little Digestion of the Matter , and it affected the Muscle on the other side of the Neck , upon which fell a fresh Collection of Matter . The Wounds were the Occasion of her Death . The Prisoner said little or nothing in his Defence , and the Jury found him Guilty . Death . 36.
