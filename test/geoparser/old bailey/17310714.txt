Thomas Pace depos 'd , That on the 26th of May , the Prisoners and Himself coming down St. Giles 's , Jack Armstrong stopped the Coach , and Yates with a drawn Hanger went into the Coach , and demanded the Gentleman 's Money , and himself went on the other Side of the Coach , and held his Hat , and the Gentleman gave him his Watch ; that afterwards they went to the King 's Arms in St. Giles 's , and drank together , and then went over-against the Bull and Gate , and stopped another Coach , and he catching hold of the Prosecutor ( Allen ) first , Armstrong pulled away his Hat , which he was unwilling to part with ; that they went about a 100 Yards farther , and stopped another Coach , and the Gentleman called out ; that then they went to Hockley in the Hole , and stopped a Chaise , and took a Watch from a Gentleman , a Silver-hilted Sword , and some Money ; and after that went to the Horse-shoe in Kingsland Road , and drank , that then the next Day William Yates and He went down to Chatham , and sold the Gold Watch that they had Robbed Mr. Sutton off , for a Silver Watch , a pair of Silver Buckles , and 12 s. in Money , and afterwards came to London again , and were taken . Elizabeth Haynes depos 'd , That the Prisoners and Evidence came to her House at the King 's Arms the Corner of Lawrence-Lane , near St. Giles 's Pound , that Night that William Bur roughs was taken up in the Morning for stopping a Coach , and had two Pots of Beer , and stay 'd from Eight till Nine o'Clock , and about Twelve they all came back with Burroughs and the Evidence Pace and Westshire , and called for two Pots of Two-penny , and Pace would not drink Two-penny , but would have Ale , and they quarrelled about some Money , but she could not say what Money , the one saying there was more , and the other saying there was less ; that they staid there about half an Hour , and would have had Punch , but it being late she refus 'd to make them any , and Yates would have persuaded her that it was not Twelve o'Clock , and pulled out a small Gold Watch to convince her . She added , that Yates and Armstrong had drank at her House several times , but she had never seen Lampree before that Night , nor had ever seen Pace with them but that Night . Henry Whetton depos 'd , That on the 26th of May , as he was going Home , and being near King-street in Holbourn , he saw a Hackney Coach stopt , and he setting his Back against a Lamp-Post , the Prisoner Yates ran by with a Hanger in his Hand , and he caught hold of Burroughs , hearing an out cry of stop Thief by Mr. Allen and 'Squire Greenwood . Henry Atkins depos 'd , That he knows the Prisoners all by sight , he being Constable , and that Lampree owned he was with the Prisoners , and would have made a Confession , but that there was one who had been before him , owned , that they had Robbed a Man near St. Giles 's Pound , and that he had the Hilt of a Sword that they had taken from a Gentleman at Hockley in the Hole , as part of his Share . John Harrison depos 'd , That he took up one Mr. Sutton near Tyburn Road , and was stopped by Armstrong a little beyond St. Giles 's Pound , and ask 'd him , who he had in his Coach ? That he said , G - d D - n you , what do you want ? That Armstrong reply 'd , G - d D - n your Eyes , stop , or I will shoot you through the Head , and that Yates and Pace got into the Coach , and the Gentleman told him afterwards , that they had Robbed him of a Gold Watch and three Guineas , that he was sure that Armstrong and Burroughs were there , he had known Armstrong for twelve Years , but he knew nothing of Lampree . James Lewis depos 'd , That when he had taken Lampree , and was carrying him before the Justice , he owned he was with Armstrong and the Rest , but only as a looker on . Mr. Justice Giffard depos 'd , That Lampree did own , that he had been forced or drawn into the Robberies by all the rest ; that the first Robbery was upon General Sutton 's Son , that then they went to the King's-Arms , and afterwards committed the Robbery on Mr. Allen , at the Bull and Gate , got into a Gentleman 's Coach ( 'Squire Greenwood 's ) and afterwards robb 'd a Gentleman at Hockley in the Hole . Samuel Baker depos 'd , That he keeping a Goldsmith 's Shop at Chatham , Yates came to him on the 28th of May , and brought a small Gold-Watch , and said , he would change it for a Silver one , he being going to Sea , it was too fine for him , and he did give him for it , a Silver-Watch , a Silver Pair of Buckles , and 12 s. in Money , and they went and drunk a Pint of Wine together , and that about 5 o'Clock he came again , and would have had him taken the Silver-Watch again , saying , it did not go well , but he refus 'd to do so ; that as they were drinking , he saw the Evidence Yates lurking about near the Place , and Smoaking a Pipe of Tobacco , and afterwards they went both together towards Robester ; that afterwards Mr. John Sutton came , and claimed the Watch , and took it away ; and that on the 24th of June , Warrington came to him , and said , he had not us 'd him well , the Watch did not go to his Mind , and at that time he caused him to be apprehended . The Prisoner Yates call 'd the following Witnesses . Sarah Hanson depos 'd , That the Evidence Pace proffer 'd to give her 5 s. to pawn the Watch taken from Mr. Sutton for 6 Guineas . Sarah Brazier depos 'd , That Warrington gave 5 Guineas to Pace for the Watch , in Bridewel . Mary Yates , Yate 's Mother , depos 'd , That she met her Son and the Evidence in Leather-Lane , and Pace offer 'd it to be pawn 'd to Sally the Cork-Cutter in May last . The Prisoners each call 'd several Persons to their Reputation ; and Lampree had so good a Character given him , that it is very probable that he was drawn in by the rest of the Prisoners , and commenc 'd Robber but that very Night ; but the Facts being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found them all three Guilty of both Indictments . Death . Thomas Mawson , of Chiswick , was indicted for stealing a Sow and Pigs , the Property of Richard Rudd , the 21 st of May last ; but there being a Deficiency in the Evidence against the Prisoner , he was acquitted . Thomas Clarkson , of Hayes , was indicted for assaulting Edward Philips on the Highway , putting him in Danger of his Life , and taking from him 3 Guineas , and 2 s. in Money , the 28th of June last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That as he was Riding from London between that and Hayes , the Prisoner and another came Riding out of a Lane into the main Road , and Rde by him , and were sometimes before , and sometimes behind , that the Prisoner at last kept behind him , and when he came within three Stones cast of the Adam and Eve , the other Prisoner attack 'd him with Pistol in Hand , and demanded his Money , which he gave him , and bid him dismount , and immediately the Prisoner came up , who he believed had stay 'd behind at the Turnpike to watch , that when the Prisoner came up , the Man who Robbed him , bid the Prisoner cut his Horse 's Bridle , which he did , and as he was cutting it , the other swore at him , saying , why do n't you cut on ; that he cut the Bridle , both the Reins and Head-stall , which having done , they both rode away a Gallop to the Town of Hayes ; that then he rode up to the Adam and Eve , and giving the Man of the House an Account of his being Robbed , he immediately clapp 'd one of his Bridles upon his Horse , and rode in Pursuit of the Prisoner . He added , That he was sure the Prisoner was the Man that cut his Bridle , it being then about Two o'Clock in the Afternoon . John Greentree depos 'd That he lives at the Sign of the Adam and Eve , and the Prosecutor giving him an Account of his being robbed , he clapt a Bridle on his Horse , and pursued them , he having seen them ride by his Door a Gallop but a few Minutes before , and acquainting Gilbert Summers that there were two Highway-men , he got a Horse and followed him , and coming to Botwel Common , he espy 'd them , the Prisoner being a-doing his Occasions , that he mounted and they rode away , himself and Summers following them till they came to Hillingdon Pound , where they turn 'd short down a long Lane , where very few People pass 'd , and coming near a Wheel-wright 's Shop , they cry 'd out , Highway-men , upon which they fell a galloping as hard as they could drive , and got to Common , and went round the Common to Harvil , and took to Robindsworth , where he lost fight of them ; but the Prisoner was taken hard by Pinner . Summers depos 'd the same as the former Evidence . Richard Hill depos 'd , That he hearing of the former Evidence being in pursuit of Highway Men , he being inform 'd by a Girl , that two Persons on such Horses as had been describ 'd to him , were gone down such a Lane , he pursued them from Batcher-Heath , and heard that they had not been gone half a Quarter of an Hour , and that they had given a Half-penny to show them the Way to Harrow on the Hill ; he pursued them to Pinner , where he saw them riding , and they seemed to make a Motion to go up to Pinner , and then went into a Field of Wheat , and they stopp 'd their great Coats , and threw them into a Ditch ; that he thereupon went to a House to get some Help , and when he came back they had been taken in the Field . Thomas Howard depos 'd , That he ves at Woodhall in Pinner Parish , and that he going into his Field , and frequently carrying a Gun with him , coming into his Field of Wheat , espy 'd the Prisoner gotten into a Hedge , among a Browze of Bushes near his Orchard Hedge , and also another Man , that he suspecting by their being concealed there , that they were upon no good Design , tho ' he had not heard any thing of their being Highwaymen , made up towards them , that the other Person crept along the Ditch , and got off ; and as he was making towards the Prisoner , he presented a Pistol at him , upon which he presented his Gun , telling him , if he did not surrender , he would fire at him , that thereupon the Prisoner dropp 'd his Pistol in the Hedge , at the Place where he stood , which was taken up loaded with Powder and Ball , and produc 'd in Court ; and he being disarmed , he apprehended him , and carried him , by the Assistance of his Man , to Pinner , whither the Prosecutor coming afterwards , and charging him with robbing him , the Justice committed him to Prison . Esau West depos 'd , That he going to the Assistance of his Master , Thomas Howard , did take up a Powder-Horn with Powder , in the very Place where the Prisoner stood . The Prisoner in his Defence denied the Fact he was charged with , and pleaded , that Edward Bonner , a Butcher , in Newgate-Market , had invited him to go into the Country with him , offering to hire a Horse , and saying it should cost him nothing , and that he knew nothing of any Design he had of going to rob on the Highway . He called several Evidences , who depos 'd , he was a Carpenter by Trade , and bore an honest Character before that time ; but the Prosecutor being positive that the Prisoner was the Person who cut his Horse 's Bridle , and that he was the Companion of the Person ( who , as he said , was Edward Bonner ) the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment .
