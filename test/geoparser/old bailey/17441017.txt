William Burton . On the 25th of last month , between the hours of one and two at night , I was going to my lodging in Covent-Garden ; but it raining very hard I was obliged to stand up , and got upon the steps of a night cellar in the Strand ; the woman of the cellar ( as I supposed her to be ) asked me what I wanted ? I said , I only stood up for the rain ; but thinking she expected I should call for something , I said , bring me a pint of beer , and then I shall give you no offence : she would have pulled me down stairs , but I did not care to go down . The pint of beer was brought , I called a watchman and gave it to him , and he called a link-boy to drink with him , and asked me if I did not want a link . I said I did not want a link : the watchman said you are very safe , you may step down and stay till the rain is over . I believe I went down two or three steps , and staid about five minutes ; I found the rain ceased , and went homeward . About three or four perch from the place I met the two Prisoners , and they said , Sir , where are you going ? I said , I do n't want any thing with you ; they laid hold of me , and began to pull me and hustle me , and riot me to pieces ; in the struggle I missed my stock and clasp , said I , You damned jades what do you rob me of my stock ? For I missed my stock ; but it is possible in the struggling with them that it might fall off , for it has fell off my neck two or three times as I have been at my work . - I missed it about three minutes after the struggle began ; I put my hand up to my hat and wig to secure them , and called out watch , upon which Page run up an alley by Hungerford-Market , the watch and I followed her and took her , and Andrews was taken the next morning upon the steps of the Round-house in St. Martin's-Lane . - There was a Sailor with them but he got away . Q . Did you find your stock and clasp again ? Eurlon . No , I never did ; the next morning the Prisoners quarrelled among one another , one said you got it and you pledged it , one said she was innocent , and the other said she was innocent . Prisoner Page . He said either Andrews or I took it , and then he charged Nan Roberts with it . Burton . The other woman she speaks of was in company with them , but I could not swear that she touched me , so she was discharged before the Justice . - I am a servant at the Mows coffee-house , but my wife and I live in James Street Covent-Garden . Prisoner Andrews . You said before the Justice , you could not charge me with it . Burton . These are the women that hustled me . - They were not searched , the watchman said it would be to no purpose , for if they had it they had found means to convey it away . Q . Was it a light or a dark night ? Burton . It was a cloudy night , but I am sure the Prisoners are the women . Acquitted . 425.

Adam Price . On the 6th of September my wife was coming to London in a one horse chaise , and the trunk in which these things were , was lost from behind the chaise between Coombs and Cavesham . I heard by a waggoner that there was a person who he saw follow the chaise , he described him , and by that means I found him out ; he lodged at a Baker 's in German-Street , and was taken there : the tweezer case and two rings were found in his pocket the 26th of September . He owned he cut the trunk from behind a one horse chaise ; the trunk was found in a field afterwards , and the other things , gowns , wearing apparel , & c. were found by his direction in his box at Mr. Tims a Taylor 's at Eaton . I heard by the waggoner that the Prisoner served three years to a Baker in Bristol . John Coxell .

Martha Terry . I keep a publick house in King street Westminster , on the 20th of September Sarah Reynolds ( who is dead ) called at my house between 3 and 4 in the afternoon , and said she was going to Billingsgate ( she had lodged in my house a fortnight before , and a woman who then lodged at my house washed for her ) she came to enquire for her aprons , and took them with her . Just before eleven at night , the three Prisoner came to the door and said they wanted a pint of hot , and it raining very hard I let them in , and they were very wet . Q . Did you know any of them before ? Terry . I have known Sarah Morris and Hannah Seans from girls : the maid went to draw the Prisoner a pint of beer , and then they took out Sarah Reynolds 's hat and two coloured aprons ; one of them had her hat , and each of them one of her aprons . Q . Did you know them to be had women ? Terry . Yes , but not till after I had let them in ; but I did not let them know I knew the things . Jonathan Reynolds . My wife not coming home all night on the 20th of September , the next morning I went to Mrs. Terry 's to enquire after her : Mrs. Terry asked me if my wife was not robbed the night before ? I told her I could not tell . Mrs. Terry said she believed she was , because she saw the Prisoners that night at her house with some of her things , and that they had left a knife at her house , - that knife was my wife . They were taken up , and my wife 's two checquered aprons were found in the room where they lodged , between the bed and the sackings I asked Morris where the aprons were , and she said Sears had them to wash. - My wife is dead , and according to all accounts she died about three quarters of an hour after this thing was done . Anthony Read . I am a watchman by Charing-Cross . On the 20th of September last about eleven at night , I met a woman smoking her pipe , and she said , watchman , be so good as to go over the way , there 's a poor woman fell down with her oisters . I went and found the unfortunate woman the deceased lying upon her back with her arms extended ; some chairmen came to my assistance , and we helped the poor woman up to the side of the houses for fear she should be run over ; I went to the Constable , and Beadle , and Regulator of the watch , and they came down , and a Doctor came to let her blood , but he said , You may as well cut her head off as let her blood , and she died presently ; the last words I heard her say were , G - d d - n my bl - d I am a gentlewoman . - She had some oister shells and a couple of flaskets , but no oisters . Q . Was the deceased in liquor when you found her ? Reed . Yes , and every body that saw her took her to be so . George Stratford ( Constable ) . The little one ( I think 't is Sears ) would have turned evidence , but the Justice would not let her , for he said they were all equally guilty : they all confessed the robbery , Morris d - d her eyes and asked what I did there , and said that Simms and Sears robbed the woman , and Sears said that she stood by while Simms and Morris robbed her ; one of them said , What a fine ride we shall have , and another said , G - d d - n your eyes what do you laugh at . Prisoner Morris . We found the things ; I was coming along and kicked them before me , and never opened them till I came into Mrs. Terry 's house , and there were several people there playing at cards . Terry .

My band is sexton of Foster-Lane Church , I live in Dove-Court in Gutter-Lane , I went to church the 20th of August about six in the evening , and double locked my door , and at seven when prayers were over I returned home , but could not open the door , and found that something was the matter with the lock . I looked through the key hole and saw two men in the house , one of them was dressed in grey , the Prisoner is the other . They presently opened the door and rushed out of the house . I laid hold of the Prisoner by the breast of the coat and said , Sir , you shall tell me how you got into the house , for I have the key in my hand ; the Prisoner got from me and run away . I went to the end of the court and cried stop thief ! He fell down flat upon his breast in the lane , and got up again ; the neighbours run after him and he was taken . - There was nobody in the house - The doors and windows were all secured when I went out , and when I came home the door was either locked or bolted on the inside . Q . Was there any thing broke ? Burn . When I came in I found there had been a cupboard door broke open . Q . How did the Prisoner get in ? Burn .

Prisoner . The door was open , there was neither lock , key , not bolt . Sarah Nabbs . I live in the same court , my mother came home a little before seven o'clock in the evening , and could not open the door : she said , dear heart , I do n't know what 's the matter with the door , I ca n't get in ; presently the door was opened , and the Prisoner and another man in grey brushed out ; said I , mother , let us endeavour to take these people , for the man in grey came a little while ago to enquire for ready furnished lodgings , and I believe they are upon an ill design . - I said hold of the man in grey by the shirt collar , and my mother laid hold of the Prisoner but they got away : the Prisoner fell down at the corner of Gold-Street and went through the Half Moon Tavern passage : I cried , stop thief ! and his coat caught hold of the hook of a door , and he was taken . They said , as he run along , he cried an arrest . - The Prisoner is one of the men who was in the house . William Rogers . On the 20th of August I was charged with the Prisoner , and found these two keys in his pocket , one is a picklock key ; the other , which is not a picklock , opened Mr . Burn 's door very easily . John Cook . I happened to see this fellow at the Justice 's , and as soon as I saw him I knew him ; he has the reputation of being a gambler and keeps a bawdy house . Prisoner . Pray ask Mr . Burn whether he did not offer to make the thing up for a guinea ? Burn . How can you have the impudence to say so , I never offered any such thing . Prisoner . I can prove where I was at that time , I had been at Mr. Stepples 's at the Fountain in Cheapside , and went afterwards to the Horseshoe in Blowbladder-Street , with one who is in Court , who told me there was an action against me at the suit of one in Bread-Street for rent ; there are a great many gentlemen here who I am sure know me . - I am an Upholsterer and Broker , and deal in the old way - The person who was along with me is run away . Richard Lease . I have nothing to say for or against the Prisoner , only that I met him one evening about six o'clock to the best of my remembrance . - I believe it was the 20th of August , but I am not sure it was . - I told him there was an action of debt against him for rent ; he desired I would go into the Horseshoe alehouse , and not talk of it in the street : we went in and he called for a tankard of beer , then a tall young man came in that the Prisoner called Captain , and he said let us be going for we shall be too late ; if we do n't go now we shall lose it : the Prisoner said , go by yourself , he went away , and in a little time returned , and then they both went away together . George Lucas . I have known the Prisoner about 10 years , I am a Plaisterer and he is an Upholsterer , I have worked with him several times both in town and country , and never heard but that he was an honest man . - I do n't know any thing to the contrary , but that he got his living honestly by his business .

Alexander Henderson . I sell fruit just by Mr. King 's shop ; I saw the Prisoner lay himself over the shop window , and he seemed as if he had been a little in liquor . I did not much like him , so I watched him and saw him put two books into his bosom . I did not interrupt him at all , and presently he took a third and went away . Then I left my stall and took hold of him , and said he must come back with me . I carried him to Mr. King , and said , Mr. King , here 's a customer for you , and took these three books from him : then he began to be very obstreperous and fell a beating me , but I did not mind that , for he had not strength enough to hurt me ; and as I was going out of the shop he drew his knife to stab Mr. King : Then I went in again and he tried to bite me , and tried to bite every body ; then we tied his arms , and he kicked like fury and swore most desperately , and said , You old rogue , if ever I am let loose again , I 'll be the death of you and your wife too . Q . How came you by these knives ? Henderson .

We were afraid to break open the door , for some persons in Field 's house held candles out of the window and showed cutlasses to us in order to terrify us , and threw brickbats and glass bottles at us ( as I imagine ) and other things that they could find . Then the mob began to rise upon us ; there were but three or four of them at first , and one of them in particular came behind me and shoved me , in order to shove me down . I said , Who are you that offers to shove any body here ; I took hold of him and said , Let us see who you are . I spoke to the Constable and he took charge of him , but the mob afterwards increased so great , that the Constable was obliged to let him go . - They call him Lippy , he has a hare lip . Q . Who went with you to Field 's ? Forfar . There were Mr. Blewmire , Mr. Montgomery , myself , and three more . Q . What happened after ? Forfar . After the mob had increased so much and were so outragious , the Constable and his assistants went away , and left only Mr. Montgomery and myself . He was cut down the coat , and went under a shell belonging to the next house to shelter himself ; seeing none but him I was willing to get away as well as I could : them one of the fellows presented a musket to me , and said he would shoot me . I said , Take care what you do , for if you miss me I will not miss you ; then I pulled out a pistol and presented it at him . Q . Had you presented your pistol before ? Forfar . I had not , I had it in my breast ; when I saw that Mr. Montgomery was attacked , I endeavoured to defend him as well as I could , ( and he told me he was hard attacked ) but he got into a house and so escaped from them : then seeing all my friends gone , I made the best of my way to Cow-Cross ; when I came just by the White-Lion in Clerkenwell , Wells cut me on the top of the head with a cutlass and desperately wounded me .

Did you ever see me with a hanger ? Blakeman . Yes , and I have seen you with a hanger at other times , and the handle has come out under your coat . Wells . I never carried a knife , much less a hanger . Watson . When I was taken up and carried to Clerkenwell Bridewell , the Prosecutor said he could not swear to one or another , and there being some people that had got money , he would not appear against them . But as we are poor fellows , and have no body to appear for us , he swore against us . The Prosecutor was asked whether this was true , but he absolutely denied it . Ann Duck . Ever since last Friday , the Gentleman of Clerkenwell Bridewell lock 'd me up , because I would not make myself an Evidence , and I told him I would not make myself an Evidence , because I did not know how ; and he said , if I did not make myself an Evidence he would hang me . Alexander Forfar called again . Q . Had you any money in your pocket when you were assaulted ? Forfar . I had 4 s. 6 d. in my pocket when I went out of my house , but what became of it I ca n't tell . For I had several rolls and tumble - I ca n't say any of them took it from me . Q . What became of your pistol ? Forfar . It was taken from me , but by whom I ca n't tell , and my handkerchief , which was tied in two know , was taken off my neck . The Jury * acquitted the Prisoners , but applied themselves to the Court , and represented , That it was a pity such dangerous persons should slip out of the Hands of Justice , and desired they might be prosecuted in another manner . And the Court ordered them to be detained , that a Bill of Indictment might be laid against them for an assault . Which was accordingly done , except against Ann Duck , who was capitally convicted upon another Indictment . * When the Prisoners were acquitted , Watson said , I thank you all Gentlemen of the Jury , you have done very right , God is the best judge among us all . Mr. Boddy , a Constable , at the Mulberry Garden , at Clerkenwell , directing himself to the Court , & c. said , He hoped they would not discharge Wells , for on the Monday after this happened , he and twelve more came to his house with drawn cutlasses in their hands , and pistols cocked , and said , D - n their Eyes and Blood , we will have him out of his house , for we will have his Head , and this Night his Brains shall be broiled in Black-Boy-Alley . 436 , 437 , 438 , 439. Thomas Wells , Theopholus Watson , Joshua Barnes , and Thomas Kirby , were indicted for a misdenieanor , in assaulting and wounding Alexander Forfar , a Headborough , and obstructing him in the execution of his office , Sept. 24 . The Evidence on the former trial for the robbery , being pretty full , it will be needless to repeat it . But as some additional Evidence was given on this trial ; we hope it will not be disagreeable to mention it , viz . When Mr. Forfar was assaulted on his return from Black-Boy-Alley , there were a great many in the gang , both men and women , and children with bludgeons , pokers , tongs , and other things ; and by their abuses , he was in such a miserable condition , that he could not stand ; having 19 wounds upon his head , and one of his fingers almost cut off . He said , the Surgeon told him the wounds and bruises he was obliged to dress were above 40 . He had three cuts given on his legs , upon Ann Duck 's crying out , Hamstring the Dog ; that Joshua Barnes cut him several times on the legs , after he was lying upon the ground , and the women fell upon him , beating and kicking him with their hands and feet . Kirby had a large knife , like a butcher 's knife , in one hand , while he was searching his breeches pockets with the other , during which time Wells stood over him with a cutlass drawn . Watson . Forfar said , Gray was one that assaulted him , and Jeffery Everett , and Jacob Aldridge ; and in Clerkenwell Bridewell Mr. Montgomery took all our names down , and said he would take care that we should take the right hand of St. Giles 's church ; and Forfar , said , As to the rest he would not trouble himself about them , but make it up with them . Forfar . I never spoke such a word . Watson . You took us up because we could not pay you any thing . Forfar . I did it out of downright justice . Barnes . He came to me several times in Clerkenwell Bridewell , and said he did not know me , and asked me where my hanger was , and I never had a hanger in my life . Forfar . I never said that I did not know him . The Prisoners were found guilty of the indictment , and received sentence to suffer one year 's imprisonment in Newgate , and to pay a fine of one shilling each . 440 . + Richard Lee , otherwise Country Dick , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for assaulting William Price , in the dwelling house of Mary Johns , putting him in fear , and taking from him a hat , value 7 s. a perriwig , value 12 s. a silver stock buckle , value 6 s. a pair of silver buttons , value 2 s. and 10 s. in money , his property , Sept. 23 . William Price . On Sunday the 23d of September , I was coming from St. Giles 's church , between 12 and one , after chapel was done . I was a going home to dinner , and just by Newton Street this young chap [ the Prisoner ] over-took me , passed me , and came just before me , and said , Sir , do you know any body that wants a servant , he said , I am of no trade , I want a Drawer ' , or a Freeman 's place . I said , I did not know of any , he must go to some intelligence office . He asked me what countryman I was , I said I was a Herefordshire man . he said he was of that country too . Said he , I have been in London about a month , I am very poor . I have no money at all . But when we came to Newton-Street , he said , I have one penny . I 'll be a penny to your half-penny , and we 'll go and drink together . He said he had a thing which he wanted me to read . Q . Did he shew you any thing ? Price . No , he did not shew me any thing at all . I thought it was a letter he wanted me to read . I said I would not go and drink with him that way , for I knew it to be a very bad place , I said if he would go with me any other way , I would go and drink a pot with him . When we were going down Newton-Street , he took hold of me , and begged me to come on , says he , Here 's another man following me , I have found a thing , and he wants it , but if you will come along with me I 'll shew it you . - There was a person behind , and he said to the Prisoner , Young man will you take a crown more than I offered you . The Prisoner said , For God 's sake come on , this man will not let me alone , let us go into some house or other , and I 'll tell you what this man is about . He offered me his waistcoat all in gold , [ his gold waistcoat ] his hat and wig , and 15 s. in money for the things I have found . Said I , how for are you a going this way ? He said , just by . Q . Did he hawl you , or force you along ? Price . Not in a forcible way . Then he carried me to Mary Johns house , and up a long entry . Just as the Prisoner got me into the entry , as I was going in at a door into the kitchen , a man came up to me , and they forced me along the entry into a room backwards . The prisoner took me to the other end of the room , and the other fellow stood at the door . Then the prisoner said he would shew me what he had found , and pulled a ring out of his pocket , and said , This is the thing I found , which that man offered me all the money and things for that I told you of ; and asked me if I would read the Posey upon the ring , and I would not read it . Then he called the other man to read it : I love none , but you alone . Then he put his hand into his pocket , and said , he had another of them . He said , As you are my countryman , if you have a mind to have these two rings you shall have them . Then he began to ask me what I had about me , and whether I had money to pay for those two gold rings . I said I did not want any gold rings . He look 'd at my shoe buckles to see whether they were silver , and looked at my stock buckle , and buttons , and he asked how much money I had about me , I said about ten shillings . Then he said could give him my shoe buckles , and stock bucd buttons , and the ten shillings , I should have the two gold rings , which were worth five pounds me . I told him I would not have them upon any account : he said they were gold . I said , If they are gold you did not come honestly by them . Then he cused me . He pressed me two or three times to take them , and I told him I would not have them . Then he swore that I should have the rings , and he would take the things . When he found I would not take the rings , he took off my hat directly , then my wig , and stock buckle . ( he left my stock in the window ) Then he said , Now I must have your money . When he said that , I was so frightened , that I thought I was in danger of my life . Q . Where was the other man all this while ? Price . He stood at the door with a stick in his hand . - The other man said he would have my money , so I thought I had better give it them than run the risque of my life , and I pulled out the money my self . Q . Did you give them the money ? Price . No , I did not give them the money ; the Prisoner took the purse out of my hand with the money in it . - I think there were 10 s. in the purse . After he had got those things , and the money , he said , Here are the two gold rings for you , but I would not touch them . When he found I would not take the rings , he laid them down upon the window in a paper , and went away directly . Then I thought as he was gone , it was proper to take the rings , in order to shew to people . - I h ave not got the rings . Q . Were they gold rings ? Price . No , they were nothing but brass . When I went home to my master 's , ( - I am a smith ) I complained how I was served , and got a warrant to take up the woman of the house , and the Prisoner ; and she said , if you will be quiet I will get you your things again , and a girl brought to my master 's house my hat and wig , and every thing but my money . So by the persuasion of the constable , and my master , who thought his life in danger , I took the things again and said no more of it . Q . How did you know the prisoner 's name ? Price . The girl said it was Country Dick who took the things . Prisoner . Did you make any noise , when you were robbed ? Price . No , I did not make any great noise . Prisoner . Did not you drink with me ? Price . No , I did not drink a drop . Prisoner . Did not you give me the money ? Price . No , I did not . Richard Read , Constable . My Lord , and Gentlemen of the Jury , I know the Prisoner at the bar to be a very notorious man . Last Monday was se'nnight we had a general privy search night . Upon searching a house at the end of Church-Lane , in St. Giles 's , the sign of the Harp and Pound . about 11 at night , going up stairs on the left hand there was a little bed , I put my hand into it , it was warm as if somebody had just been in it . I went up two pair of stairs , and there was a room with three beds upon the ground , with one man in each bed , and I searched under the beds to see if there were any arms , after every body was gone out of the room , except a soldier and myself . Says the soldier , here 's a closet you have not searched yet . No more I have , said I. I put my hand in , and felt something like linen , I pulled it to me , imagining it to be something of linen hanging in the closet , and it tore . Upon examining it , I found it to be the slap of a shirt . I put my hand in again and pulled the Prisoner 's head out at the door , then I called out , and said , Gentlemen , I have got hold of a fellow , who is a common rescuer of Prisoners , and pulled him quite out . His shirt was tore , and I had the slap in my hand . I wanted to see him with his hat on , for I knew him by the cock of his hat . When he had it on , said I , You are the person who sent me word , you would blow my Brains out , and I said , Now I have a mind to blow your Brains out , and I secured him . Next morning he was examined before two of the Justices , and who should come in but the young man that he robbed , ( Adam Price . ) Said he , I know that man . Said I , Do you know Country Dick ? Yes , said he , He robbed me of my hat , wig , and other things , and 10 s. in money , said I , I am glad I have got him . And as Price was giving an account of the 10 s. he had in his purse ; says Country Dick , there was but 8 s. 6 d. in it . Then , said I , You have done for yourself now . I would advise you to turn Evidence and save your neck , for I was sensible he belonged to a great gang , and he gave me informations of several , whose names I have in my pocket ; which he did in hopes of being made an Evidence . I went afterwards to him in Newgate , and told him I believed there was one or two he had given me information of , that I had got , and if he had a mind to make himself an Evidence he might . Then he said , I do n't know any thing of the matter , you made me drunk among you , that I did not know what I said . Prisoner . The Constable says I wanted to make myself an Evidence , and gave an information against some Persons . I told him of two or three that were concerned with me in selling * Rings , but as to robberies I never was concerned in any . Guilty . Death . * The Prisoner has frequently made his Brags , that he could sell Rings as well as any Body . 441.+ Clement Haggett * was indicted for the murder of Samuel Wackett , by giving him with a sword made of Iron and Steel of the value of 12 d. a wound upon the left side of the belly , above the navel , of the breadth of one inch , and the depth of four inches , on the 15th day of September last , in the Parish of St. Martin 's in the Fields , of which he languished till the 21st day of the same month , and in the Parish of Pancras died . * His right Name is Hackett . He was a second time charged by virtue of the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said murder . Thomas Jones . I keep a public house , the sign of the Plough , in St. Martin 's Lane . On the 15th of September in the evening , Serjeant Wackett ( the deceas 'd ) came in , and while he was there the Prisoner came in , and when he was going away , one Lloyd said , Why will you go ? I will strike you down if you wo n't stay . There were some words arose between the two Serjeant s , about the duty of a soldier ; and the deceased began to be angry , and the Prisoner said , Do n't be angry , I 'll ask pardon , what would you have me do ? Q . Did you hear any talk about the Prisoner 's borrowing half a crown of the deceased ? Jones . I did not hear any thing of the half crown ; a little while after they all went away together ; about a quarter of an hour after that , the Prisoner and the deceased came in again ; and the Prisoner said , Mr. Jones let us have a Quartern of Brandy ; the deceased said , I will have no Brandy , let us have Rum ; but they had neither , they had a Tankard of Beer , and sat down by the fire together . I thought the dispute was all made up , but on a sudden , I heard my wife cry out , Oh Lord , there will be murder . I saw a sword drawn in the Prisoner 's hand , and clapped my hand upon his wrist , and then the deceased cried out , He has stabbed me . I saw blood on the inside of his waistcoat , and upon his shirt . I went to Mr. Hewitt the Surgeon , and when he came in the deceased was sitting in a chair , ( I did not know then that the Prisoner was wounded ) and the deceased said to Mr. Hewitt , Dress my comrade first . Q . Where was the Prisoner wounded ? Jones . He was wounded in the back very much . Q . What , with a sword ? Jones . I believe it was with a hanger . Q . Did you see any blows given ? Jones . I did not see any . Q . When your wife said there would be murder , was the sword , or the hanger drawn ? Jones . They were both drawn then . Pris . Council . You say both the sword and hanger were drawn ; did you think yourself time enough to have prevented the mischief ? Jones . I thought I was . Q . Who were in the room then ? Jones . There were John Barney , Thomas Holden , my wife , and Richard Godson my servant . Thomas Holden . On the 15th of September in the evening , I was at Mr. Jones 's smoking a pipe with Mr. Barney . Serjeant Wackett was there , and had 2 or 3 pints of been before the Prisoner came in . When the Prisoner came in he said he was very glad to see the deceased , and they seemed very glad to see one another . The Prisoner was for going away several times , but one Lloyd said he should not go , and said , Clem sit down . ( the Prisoner was very much suddled when he came in ) After that the Prisoner and the deceased had some discourse about a Corporal 's , or a Private Man 's duty , or some misdemeanors in the regiment . The deceased said , let it all drop , we 'll have it decided by the Captain , on the parade to-morrow . Some time after the Prisoner said to the deceased , Sam lend me half a crown ; the deceased said , Poh ! Poh ! you do n't want money ; the Prisoner said , I do want money , lend me half a crown . The deceased put his hand in his pocket and threw half a crown down . Then the Prisoner said to the deceased , Do you know God ? The deceased said , I hope I do . The Prisoner said , God pay you , or God will pay you , and then they all three went out of the house together . This was about 11 o'clock . It was not long before they came in again , then the Prisoner asked for some brandy or rum , the deceased said he would drink no drams , if they had any thing , they would have a tankard of beer , which they had . Mr. Jones and I were playing a game at draughts . The Prisoner and deceased were in a box by themselves ; presently I heard Mrs. Jones cry out , There will be murder . I looked and saw a small sword in the Prisoner 's hand drawn ; the deceased turned himself round and said , The villain has stabbed me ; then the deceased turned about and gave the Prisoner a cut in the back . Q . When you turned about first , after you heard the deceased say , the villain has stabbed me , was his hanger drawn , or had he it by his side ? Holden . He had it by his side - When the deceased first cried out , he had it by his side ; and I saw him draw it . Q . Did you see the Prisoner stab the deceased ? Holden . I did not see it . Q . What did you see first ? Holden . The first thing I saw was the small sword drawn in the Prisoner 's hand I would not hurt any one , I would speak the truth , and no more than the truth God knows . Thomas Jones called again . Pris . Council . You hear this man says the deceased was stabbed , before the hanger was drawn , was it so or not ? Jones . The cut on the Prisoner 's back was given before the deceased clapped his hand upon his belly , and said , The villain has stabbed me . Pris . Council . Will you take upon you to say the deceased 's hanger was drawn then , and he made no use of it afterwards ? Jones . His hanger was drawn , when he said he was stabbed . Q. to Holden . Did you hear any challenge given ? Holden . I did not . Mr. Hewitt , ( Surgeon . ) I was sent for to the deceased , he had a wound between the third and fourth ribs , which penetrated into the Cavity of the belly . Q . Was that wound the occasion of his death ? Hewitt . I opened the body , and I found a vast quantity of bloody matter in the belly , which came from the wound , which was the occasion of his death . Pris . Council . Can you give any opinion as to the nature of the wound , how it was given , or in what position the deceased was ? Hewitt . It appears to me , that as the deceased was a right handed man , that the wound could not be given when he was upon his guard . - The wound was on the left side of the belly . Upon opening the body , I examined the Spleen and Kidney , and I ca n't say positively , whether the Spleen , or the Kidney was wounded ; but I think the Spleen was wounded . Pris . Council . Supposing two men had stood directly facing one another , quarrelling ; do you think they could have given such a wound as that ? Hewitt . Indeed , I believe not . Q . Had the Prisoner any wound ? Hewitt . The Prisoner had a wound back . Q . Was that a cut or a stab ? Hewitt . I took it to be a stab , from the nature of the wound , for it had first penetrated , and then turned round ; to the best of my remembran deceased said it was a stab . - I was sent for that night , about a quarter of an hour after the accident happened . Q . How long did the deceased live afterwards ? Hewitt . From the Saturday evening , to the Friday se'nnight following . He desired I would attend him , and so did his colonel . As to the Prisoner , he was left to the care of the Surgeon of the Regiment . Q . Did the deceased tell you the occasion of it ? Hewitt . He told me he and his comrade had some words about a private man 's doing his duty , but had agreed in the end , and were very good friends . But returning again to drink something , they received the dispute . The deceased was for bringing it before the colonel , and that exasperated the Prisoner , and he challenged him , and upon his challenging him , the deceased said , Then turn out . Q . Was the deceased in great danger from the first ? Hewitt . He was in extream danger , and I thought there was occasion to call in more Surgeons , I mentioned the Surgeon General , but the Colonel said he was satisfied with me ; however I took that Gentleman with me for my further satisfaction with relation to the wound . Q . Did the deceased desire you to dress the Prisoner 's wound first ? Hewitt . He desired me to take care of his comrade , for he had a value for him . Q . What did the deceased say , with relation to any complaint of the Prisoner 's behaviour or usage ? Hewitt . He said the Prisoner stabbed him first . Q . What before his hanger was drawn ? Hewitt . He did not say any thing of that . Q . Did he make any complaint of any foul practice , or proceeding , or did he say it was a fair quarrel ? Hewitt . He did not say much of that to me , but I think , if any thing , he complained of it . Q . Did he say the Prisoner had murdered him ? Hewitt . I do n't know that he said any thing of that . Elizabeth Moreton . I was with the deceased all the time of his illness , and he always said the villain had stabbed him , and about two hours before he died , he desired that God would provide for his family , for Mr. Haggett had murdered him . Charles Nicholson , ( a soldier . ) I was with him about two hours before he died , and he begged that God Almighty would provide for his distressed family , for he did not think he should live that night out . Jane Wackett . My husband declared that the Prisoner stabbed him before he drew his hanger , and he declared that before the Surgeon on the Monday following . Mr. Hewitt called again . Q . Did you hear the deceased say the Prisoner stabbed him before he drew his hanger ? Hewitt . I do n't particularly remember that he said the Prisoner stabbed him before he drew his hanger . - I do n't remember his mentioning the hanger , but he said the Prisoner stabbed him first . Mrs. Jones . When the Prisoner , the deceased , and Lloyd came into our house the second time , the Prisoner called for a quartern of brandy or rum , and the deceased said if he drank any thing he would have beer . As I was dressing some stakes the deceased said , By G - d the Colonel shall decide this affair between you and I to morrow morning ; and in a minute the deceased got up and pushed by between the table and me , but I did not apprehend any thing of mischief , and I heard the words , D - n you draw , or I 'll cut you . - I do n't know who said the words , and I saw the deceased 's hanger drawn and his arm extended . Q . Were either of them got out of the box , when the word draw was spoke . Jones . The deceased was just got out to the end of the box . Prisoner 's Council . It has been asserted that the deceased said , The villain has killed me ; was you so near that you must have heard it if he had said so ? Jones . Yes , I was so near , that I must have heard it , but I did not hear it . Richard Godson . I heard the deceased say , You villain draw or I 'll cut you . Q . Had he any weapon then ? Godson . Yes , I saw him hold up his hanger drawn then . John Burney . I heard the words , D - n you draw or I 'll cut you . Q . Did you hear any complaint of being stabbed ? Burney . Yes , the deceased said , The villain has stabbed me ; that was after the words , D - n you draw or I 'll cut you . Prisoner 's Council . Was the stab given in the box or out of the box ? Burney . I believe it was by the side of the box . Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 442 . + Peter Delgens * , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , was indicted for breaking and entering the dwelling house of Christopher Pinchbeck , between the hours of one and two in the night , and stealing two gold cane heads , value 5l . twelve pair of silver buckles , value 6 l. a metal cup , value 6 d. a metal castor , value 2 s. and two ivory hook heads for canes , value 3 s. the goods of Christopher Pinchbeck , June 27 . * He says his name is Velgent , he appeared very much like a gentleman by his habit . Christopher Pinchbeck . The 27th of June in the morning I heard a noise in the house , and came down and found a hole in one of the shutters of my shop , which had been made by a nail piercer . The glass was broke , and several pair of never buckles , with two gold cane heads were taken away . - My dwelling house is the corner of Pallmall , facing the Haymarket . On the 30th of July my man told me he believed he had got the person who had stole my goods , and Mr. Chidleigh one of the Constables of St. James 's told me he believed he had got a man who had some of my buckles , who was taken attempting to break open a house : I found some of my buckles , two pair of shoe buckles , and two pair of knee buckles , but the marks were pretty near taken out of them . The Constable and I went to the Round house where the Prisoner was confined , and I was confounded at the thing , upon account of the number of people that appeared for him , and the appearance that he made himself . He told me the place where he lodged , upon which I got a warrant from Justice Fraser to search his lodgings , and upon searching them I found two ivory hook heads for canes , which I believed to be mine , but the man [ Prisoner ] was such a concern to me , that I would not be positive to them ; but upon opening another drawer , I found some childrens metal toys [ a metal castor and a metal cup ] ( and saucer , and a metal teapot , which is not mentioned in the indictment ) which I am certain are mine , for I made them several years ago , and there were none of them made before nor since ; they are marked at the bottom with the two initial letters of my name , I have had them a good many years and never sold any of them . We took the things with us and went to the Round-house again , and carried the Prisoner before Justice Fraser . When I mentioned the buckles to him , he said he was a person that dealt in that way , and I find he is a Jeweller ; then I produced these little toys and the ivory hook heads ( then I was sure to the ivory heads , though I was doubtful about them before ) he said he had bought them , and should be able to make it appear who he bought them of upon his trial . He had a pair of silver buckles in his shoes such as I lost of my workman 's make . I have since had some of the goods brought me by other people , who will declare they had them of him . I think I can take upon me to say I saw the silver buckles in my shop the day before , because I had shewn them to a customer : and when I looked at a pair of silver buckles he had in the knees of his breeches , he said , they are not yours , no more they were . Prisoner 's Council . How do you know these buckles are yours ? Pinchbeck . I do n't say I am positive they are mine , for my workman works for other people ; the marks were filed out . John Chidleigh . On the 30th of June I was at the watchouse , and Mr. Hill of Pallmall brought the Prisoner into the watchouse , and charged him with breaking his shop . I took him into custody and put him into the hold , and hearing that Mr. Pinchbeck 's shop was broke open before , thinks I , this is the gentleman , though he looks like a gentleman ; he threatened me very much , and said he was a gentleman , and then a Jeweller . I said I would lock him up , but I searched him fi rst for fear he should have any pistols , and I found these buckles ; said I , You look very much like a gentleman because you have so many buckles , I take these to be Mr. Pinchbeck 's buckles . I took this saw from him , and the teeth of the saw were as full of deal sawdust as they could hold , which I believe came out of Mr. Pinchbeck 's shutter with his boring the holes ; these are the gimblets which he made use of , this is the piercer he bored Mr. Hill 's shutter with . I went to Mr. Hill 's and fitted it to the holes in the shutter , and it fitted as near as could be . - I am in the building way : I went to Mr. Pinchbeck 's on the Saturday morning between one and two o'Clock , and his man got up ; I told him I believed I had got the thief who robbed his master , and he was then in the Round-house . I shewed him the buckles , and he positively said he could swear to them . I put this nail piencer into the holes which were made in Mr. Pinchbeck 's window shutter , and it fitted as well as a nail piercer could do : he had ripped down the holes with a small saw , till he had got a piece out ; this is the piece of wood which fitted the hole in Mr. Pinchbeck 's window shutter , I fitted it to the hole myself . [ There was a piece of the window shutter produced , about 4 or 5 inches square . ] Ellis Pugh . I am a servant to Mr. Pinchbeck , this piece of wood is part of my master 's window shutter . Q . Where did you find it ? Pugh . I found it in the hole it was taken from - Loose in the hole - The shutters were all whole after it was dark . Chidleigh . When this piece of wood was put to the shutter , then the holes appeared , for they were all bored before it was cut out ; it was bored either with a gimblet or a spike bit . - Tis a spike bit , we tried several of the holes , and this spike bit was as full of the saw dust which seemed to come out of that shutter as could be . I said to Mr. Pinchbeck it is the best way to get a search warrant ; we got a search warrant and searched his lodgings , and there we found these things : there were some metal toys which Mr. Pinchbeck swore to , and one ivory hook head he was positive to , because part of it was broke off by an accident , [ the goods were produced . ] Pinchbeck . These buckles are the same make as mine , but I ca n't positively swear to them , there were a great many chases of buckles found in the Prisoner 's room , but the silver was all gone : we found two small files and a burnisher , which are used in taking out names and marks . Chialeigh . Mr. Pinchbeck 's man said before the Justice , that the Prisoner had a pair of buckles in his shoes which were his master 's , and he said may be there may be another pair in his knees , and the Prisoner said , they are not yours . Mr. Pinchbeck 's man took out one of them , and it was not his master 's : then the Prisoner was carried to Clerkenwell Bridewell , and he said he would endeavour to make friends with Mr. Pinchbeck to find the bill Ignoramus , and then he should be saved . I said he should send what goods he could of Mr. Pinchbeck 's to him , and that would be the way to make Mr. Pinchbeck his friend ( there were several of the goods sent to Mr. Pinchbeck ) when I advised him to that , he said he would ; and that he had ordered several people , particularly Mr. Bell a Taylor and his washerwoman , to carry some things to him . He desired I would recommend it to Mr. Pinchbeck to be easy with him , and he would get all the things again that he could , and make satisfaction for what goods he could not recover by raising friends , and said he hoped I would not be his enemy . I said it was not in my power to help him ; he said , O Lord ! what a sad thing it is that I have happened to light upon such a Constable that was so hard : I asked him if he had any confederates , he said he had none ; said I , You must have some confederates to receive your goods , you should impeach them ; he said he had nobody to impeach , there was no soul concerned with him , and he was a very unhappy man to fall into such hands as would not shew him mercy . Prisoner . How came you to go to Mr. Pinchbeck to enquire about me concerning this matter ? Chidleigh . I do n't live above a dozen doors from Mr. Pinchbeck . I had matched this piece of wood to the window shutter the day before , and I said I would look out , and may be I might find the person that did it . Eilis Pugh called again . Q . What time did you find that the house was broke open ? Pugh . About two o'clock in the morning , I found the shutter broke , the glass of the window broke , and the show glass broke . Q . Where did the show glass stand ? Pugh . It stood I believe about three inches on the right hand of the hall , just on the inside of the window . Q . In what manner do you think he took these goods out ? Pugh . To be sure he must take them out with his hand , and he could by putting his hand in at the hole , take them out of the show glass . Q . Did you miss the things directly after you observed the shop to be broke open ? Pugh . I missed no more than one gold cane head at first ; I called my master about a quarter after two , but did not miss the things directly : my master went to bed again , but I would not go to bed , and when my master came down , we missed the rest of the things , this castor and cup were missing - They are my master 's : I took a pair of my master 's buckles out of the Prisoner 's shoes before the Justice , I believe these are my master 's buckles . Chidleigh . These are the buckles which were taken out of the Prisoner 's shoes before the Justice . Pugh . The Prisoner sent these silver buckles to Mr. Pinchbeck by his washerwoman Mrs. Prees . Jaquelin Prees . I had these two pair of silver buckles from the Prisoner at the bar , which he gave me in part of payment for some money he owed me . Prisoner . What did the chairman say to you against me , when I was taken up ? Chidleigh . He said you were leaning against Mr. Hill 's window shutters , and he thought you intended to do something you should not do , and stood a little on one side to watch , and heard the shutter crack , and then he came up to you and you run away , then he made a run at you and you fell down and he fell over you : he said you dropped the nail piercer and he took it up . William Knox ( a Chairman . ) On the 30th of June I was in Pallmall about one o'clock in the morning , I was about twenty yards off the Prisoner , and he was stooping against a shutter . I came up a little nearer to him and heard the shutter crack : he was then standing upright , and I believe he saw me ; then he went behind the lamp post at the next door , I went up to him in order to lay hold of him , and heard something drop , what it was I could not then tell , but I afterwards found a nail piercer ; then I called the watchman , and kept the Prisoner till the watchman came to me , the Prisoner made an attempt to get away from the watchman ; I run after him again and he fell down , I must either have tumbled over him or have fell upon him , if I had not stepped over him . Then the watchman came up and gave the rails a knock with his staff and said , I have done for him now , he 'll never run again : the watchman thought he had struck him , but he only hit the rails : then I knocked at Mr. Hill 's door and shewed him the place the Prisoner had been attempting to break open ; he had bored 13 holes in the shutters . We carried him to the Round-house , and Mr. Hill searched the Prisoner and found two pair of silver buckles upon him ; he asked him what he was , he said he was a Jeweller by trade , and that he made buckles . Q . Where did you find the nail piercer ? Knox . As near as I can guess about six yards from the place where the holes were bored , and the Constable tried whether the nail piercer fitted the holes , and nothing could fit better . When the Prisoner was before the Justice next day , he was asked how he came by the buckles ; he said he bought them , and if we would let him alone for three or four days , he would find the man he bought them of . Prisoner . He says he was in Pallmall , ask him how he could see me , as he was on the other side of the way in Pallmall and the street is so broad ? Knox . There were two lamps , and by the light of the lamps I saw him leaning against the shutter . Prisoner . I have persons in Court to prove that I have bought buckles and deal in buckles , all the rest is a malicious prosecution . I do n't know whether 't is for the sake of the reward or what , I ca n't tell , I can prove that I bought the things . Elizabeth Hewson . I lived at the Mitre tavern in the Strand - I kept the house . About the 28th of June - it was on a Friday morning between 10 and 11 o'clock , the Prisoner and another person came in and called for a pint of white wine . I went into the room where they were , and saw a tea kettle and lamp stand upon the table . Q . What sort of a tea kettle was it ? Hewson . A little doll 's thing . Q . What metal were they ? Hewson . Gold , I took them to be . Q . What else was there ? Hewson . There were a coffee pot , a pepper castor , a sugar castor , a cup , a saucer , and I believe about a dozen and a half of silver buckles ; I took the tea kettle in my hand and asked if it was gold , and one of them said it was metal gilt . Q . Do you remember any thing that passed relating to these things ? Hewson . I saw the Prisoner at the bar give the other person five guineas , and the person he gave it to said he would not have taken it , if he had not been very much put to it for money . Q . Did you see him take the money ? Hewson . Yes , I saw him take the money into his hand . Q . How came you to remember the day so particularly ? Hewson . It was the day to the best of my remembrance . Q . Have you any thing particular to remember it by ? Hewson . I remember it for a very good reason , because I left the house the Wednesday after . Q . How long had you kept the house ? Hewson . Not above three months . I never lived in London before I took that house . Q . Have you a husband ? Hewson . Yes - he is in the army - he is at Plymouth now . Q . How came you to keep the house but three months ? Hewson . I took it by the week . Q . Are these the toys you saw at your house ? Hewson . I believe they are the same . - Harrach . I have known the Prisoner about four or five years , and believe him to be as honest a man as any in England . He always had a good character , he has had goods of me upon return ; - and what he did not sell he returned very justly ; if I had thought he had been a rogue , I would not have dealt with him . - He was a jeweller by trade , but he dealt as well as worked at his business . Q . How long is it since you dealt with him ? Harrach . I ca n't tell , I believe the day that he was taken up , he had a watch or two upon return , and towards the dusk of the evening he returned them to me . Lewis Martineau . I knew the Prisoner at Paris , and always took him to be a very honest man . Paul Phillipon . I have known the Prisoner 8 years , we have worked together in Amsterdam , and his character was very good there ; he went over to France , and bore a very good character there . I have worked with him in England , and he always had a good character . Paul Blanchard . He has come to my house a great many times , he had a good character , and was a pretty gentleman . Mr. Garnault . I knew the Prisoner at Paris 9 months , he behaved well , and I always took him to be a gentleman ; he has been at my house frequently , he was a dealer in watches , and other things , which he has shewn me several times . Richard Deshoverie . I have known the Prisoner seven years ; I knew him at Paris , and have sometimes sold him goods . I never heard any thing against his character . I never had any great intimacy with him . Mr. Vanborn . I have known the Prisoner some years ; I have had dealings with him to a considerable value ; I have trusted him with goods at one time , to the value of 100l . which he safely returned to me again . Prisoner . My Lord , It is all a pack of false stories , and it has been reported at Slaughter 's Coffee-house , that they broke open the house , on purpose to charge me with it . Guilty Death . He was a second time indicted for breaking , and entering the dwelling house of James Wood , in the night time , in the Parish of St. James , Westminster ; and stealing 24 China cups , value 21 s. and 18 china saucers , value 12 s. the property of James Wood ; but he was not tried upon this indictment . 443. Peter Harris of St. Stephen Coleman Street , was indicted , for that he being an evil disposed person , after the 21st of May , 1734. to wit , on the 17th of September last , with a certain short gun , which he then and there had , and held in his right hand upon Alexander Norman , feloniously did make an assault , with intent the monies of the said Alexander Norman , to steal , take and carry away , against the form of the statue , & c . Alexander Norman . On the 17th of last month , between ten and eleven at night , as I was coming over Moorfields , I met the Prisoner with a gun in his hand , he swore at me , demanded my money , and said he would have it . I told him I would not give it him , unless he was a better man than I ; he said if I did not he would blow my brains out . I took hold of the gun , and shook the gun in his hand in great hopes it would have gone off . After I had disputed a great while with him , he bid me go about my business , or he would blow my brains out . Then I watched him , in hopes some body would come up , and I got a watchman afterwards and secured him . Q . Had he a gun with him then ? Norman . He had not a gun then , but I bid the watchmen look into the quarters as far as they supposed a person could throw a gun , and I believed they would find it ; they looked for it there , and there they found it . - I am sure he is the man , for we were under a lamp , and he was hardly out of my sight till he was taken . Prisoner . My Lord , I desire you would enquire into the character of the Prosecutor , for he bears a very good character in Newgate , he has been in Newgate . Q . Have you ever been confined in Newgate ? Norman . I was , but it was only for a quarrel , in a publick house , for assaulting Mr. Hunt , a Beadle , in one of the hospitals ; I was removed from the Poultry Counter there . Prisoner . I would ask you what time a night it was that I stopped you ? Norman . It was between ten and eleven . Prisoner . I can bring witnesses to prove that I was at home then . - Barber . On the 17th of September , at night , I sat up as constable for Coleman Street Ward . Between one and two in the morning Alexander Norman came to the watch at Moorgate , and said , there was a collector in the fields , about 7 or 8 of the watchmen went out , and then they called for their master . I went to the walk that goes from Old Bethlehem , and asked for our watchmen . I stood there a little while , and the Prisoner ( as I think by his voice ) called hollo ! and I said , hollo ! the Prisoner came running without hat or wig . I asked the Prosecutor , and the watchmen if they had seen any body , they said no . I said there was a little man run by , and run up Fore-street . I asked the Prosecutor how he was served , his name , and where he lived , and he told me . I said , you seem to be an honest sort of a man , I 'll go out again and see for him ; and as I was going from the watch-house , the Prisoner came back again from that place where he had passed me ; said I , There 's the man ; I went to the corner of Little Moorfields , and called after him , and said , I want to speak a word with you ; said I , What business are you ; he said , I am a shaggreen-case-maker , I live in Fell street , in Wood-street ; said I , This is an odd time of night to be out . I said to Mr. Norman , is this the man , Mr. Norman said , That is the man ; the Prisoner asked him what he charged him with , he said he would tell him when he came before a justice , but the Prisoner insisted upon knowing what he charged him with ; he said , with assaulting him with an intent to rob him ; I said , if Mr. Norman charged me with him , he must go to the Counter ; Mr. Norman said , If you will let the watchman go , I believe they will find the gun pretty near the rails ; they went out and found it pretty near the rails , and came with it to the watch-house , in about eight minutes and when it was brought in , I said , Now , Mr. Harris , what do you think of that ; but I thought it odd that he should rob with such a long gun . Prisoner . Was not I in the watchouse before Norman came up ? Barker . No . Prisoner . Did I make any resistance ? Barker . No . William Negus a watchman . After the Prisoner was brought to the watchouse I went to search for the gun , and found it standing up against one of the posts of the quarters in the middle walk in Moorfields , on the out side of the post - The farthest post of the right hand quarter , it was found little after two o'clock , this is the gun . Q . Was the gun charged ? Negus . I do n't know , it is just as it was then , the barrel is stopped , there was no slint in it . Norman . This is the gun * . * An old shattered rusly gun with a small barrel about two foot nine inches long . Prisoner . When the gun was produced before the Alderman , it had neither lock nor flint . Negus . Yes it had a lock . Barker . The Prisoner said he worked with one Mr.Kemp in Lillipot-Lane ; I said he is a man of reputation , I know him very well : the next day I asked him who he had to appear for him , he said nobody ; said I , you spoke of Mr. Kemp , why do n't you send for him ; he said he had sent to him , and he was out of the way . Sarah Barnes . I live at Mr. Norman 's the Rose and Bird Cage in Wood-street , between twelve and one the Prisoner came to our house , and it was after one before he went out . Q . What day of the month was it ? Barnes . It was the 18th of September . Q . That was not the night . Barnes . This was after twelve o'clock , the 17th was the day before . Q . How came you to be so particular as to the time ? Barnes . I was in the house and drew the beer for him . Q . What occasion had you to remember it ? Barnes . I had no great occasion - What gave me more reason to remember it was , that he did not pay for the two pints of beer he had , and they were set down in the house and the day of the month to it - As far as I know the Prisoner is a very honest man . Elizabeth Giles . I live in Fell-street - My husband is a Chimney-sweeper ; the Prisoner has been a lodger in my house two years , and always behaved handsomly : he came in on the 17th of September between eight and nine at night very much in liquor , and sat himself down in a chair : he was so much in liquor that he could not sit in the chair , but laid down upon the boards , I thought to get him into his own room , but I could not : his wife and I went to bed , and left him in the kitchen ; after the clock struck twelve , I said , Mrs. Harris , Let him lye there , and she said , so she would , for then he would be safe - What became of him afterwards I ca n't tell . Charles Thomas . I have known the Prisoner three quarters of a year , he lived over-against me , and I never heard any ill of him . Mr. John Kirk one of the Jury-men , desired to be heard , with regard to the Prisoner , and being sworn , he said the Prisoner had worked 7 years with his brother as a journey-man , but not being a Freeman , he was forced to turn him away . William Kirk , ( the last witness 's brother . ) The Prisoner worked with me 7 years , and I never knew any thing amiss of him , if I had he should not have staid with me so long - He behaved very well . John Ruffin , ( another Jury-man . ) I have known the Prisoner 7 years ; I know he worked with Mr. Kirk , and I believe he parted with him only because he was not a Freeman . - Mr. Kirk is a Shaggreen-case-maker . William Hill . I have known the Prisoner two years as being a lodger with Mrs. Giles , he was always a very inoffensive man , I have been in his company several times . Edward Stafford .

I have known him about three quarters of a year , and to the best of my knowledge he is a very inoffensive man , and as far as I know always behaved himself in a very handsom manner . Prisoner .

George Cheshire . On the 21st of September I was robbed in Thatched Ally , in Chick-Lane , between 8 and 9 at night ; I had been in a house to drink a dram , and in less than the space of a minute , after I came out , three women came out of the house , and two of them followed me , the Prisoners are the persons ; Mrs. Barefoot came on my left side , and put her right arm round my neck , and with her left confined my arm ; Ann Duck was on my right side , and put her left arm round my neck , and with her right hand picked my pocket and took out 4 d. I resisted , and they began to beat me , and Ann Duck gave me several blows . I cried out murder , and then they called out for assistance ; upon their calling out for help , there came one man , and one woman , one of whom gave a mopstick into the hand of Ann Duck , with which she gave me several blows upon my arms and back , and particularly one upon my left eye , which swelled my eye up , and cut it pretty much , and Ann Barefoot gave me a blow on the side of the head , with something she had in her hand , which I took to be a stone , or a brickbat , for it was very hard . I was so bad with their usage , that I could not work at my business for a fortnight . I went home directly to my landlady , I told her how I was used , and asked her to few my eye up , and she did something to my eye . Q . What business are you ? Cheshire .

Cheshire . Yes . Q . Was you hindered so that you could not have prevented it ? Cheshire . Yes , for they confined me on both sides . Q . Had you any more money in that pocket ? Cheshire . I believe I had a penny , or a half-penny more , but I will not say more than I know . Q . Did you know the Prisoners before ? Cheshire . I knew them by sight , I have seen them sometimes , as I live in the neighbourhood ; I knew Ann Duck by name very well . Q . Did you ever keep company with the Prisoners ? Cheshire . No , never in my life . Q . Where do you live ? Cheshire . I lodge at Mrs. Dale 's , in Cross-Keys-Court in Chick-Lane . Ann Duck .

Q . Were you ever before a magistrate with these women ? Cheshire . No , I was not . Q . Why did not you endeavour to get them taken up ? Cheshire . I went to Freeman 's , a publick-house in Chick-Lane , the next day , and enquired after them , and they told me they durst not tell me their names for fear of having damage done them , and I never heard any more of them , till I was sent for ; after they were taken up .

Q . What is his master 's name ? Dale . I ca n't tell , I forget , I am always so ; this young man , [ the Prosecutor ] had been out , and when he came in , he said , Mrs. Dale , pray bring a needle and thread ; and he said , Mrs. Dale , if you knew what a case I am in you would come and help me ; said I , What is the matter with you ? He said , Nan Duck and two other women have abused me in this manner . His eye was cut very much . Mrs. Freeman , who keeps an Ale-house in the neighbourhood , knows this too , but she will not come without she is fetched , because she thinks as she lives in the neighbourhood it will be a prejudice to her . I took a needle and thread and sewed his eye up , and put a piece of beef upon his face to lay the swelling ; for it was swelled very much , and I believe he could not go out of the house for 6 or 7 days . Q . How along is this ago ? Dale . I think it is about a fortnight ago , or it may be three weeks - I know it is but a small time ago . Q . Where about on the eye was the wound ? Dale .

On the 18th of September , Mr. Townley , and Mr. Long came to Thomas Page 's house to serve a warrant upon him and his wife - in the Bowl yard , in Broad St. Giles 's . Q . Upon what occassion was this warrant served ? Tiller . Upon a frivolous occassion , a quarrel , it was about 8 o'clock at night , the deceased was just going to bed , his shoes and stockings were off , and he denied leave to put them on . Mrs . Page desired to know whether she was obliged to go at that time o'night , and they gave her leave to stay , as they had her husband . He was carried to Mr. Townley 's house . There was another assistant in the barbarity , who it was I do n't know . Q . What is Townley ? Tiller . He keeps a Publick-house in Broad St. Giles 's , Mr. Long is the Beadle , I do n't know any thing of Savage . We went to the Ale-house about nine o'clock , Mr. Townley went out to serve a warrant upon another person , and did not return till about 11 o'clock , and he was pretty much in liquor . Page wanted to go before the Justice to have the thing decided that night , and Townley said it was too late , and I said I believed it was not . Townley refused to take his word for his appearance in the morning , though he said he would leave 20 Guineas in his hand if he would take toward . Page went to the back door to make water , Long went to the door and caught hold of him by the coat , called him rascal , and son of a bitch , and said , What are you a going to make your escape ? Page said , I am no son of a bitch , I am an honest man , and have an honest wife , and several fine children . Upon that , Long shortened his cane and hit him several blows on the stomach and other parts ; the deceased fell down upon the ground with these blows . Q . Were the blows given with violence ? Tiller . They were given with great violence . Mr. Townley went to his bar and fetched out a short staff or truncheon , and gave him several blows upon the head ? Q . Was it a Constable 's staff ? Tiller . It was a painted staff . Then the deceased begged for mercy , and said , for Christ 's sake do n't murder me . The widow and I fell down on our knees and begged for mercy . There was one John Gasson came in , and I desired he would assist the deceased that he might not be murdered , and Mr. Townley 's maid servant said , For God 's sake master do n't commit murder in your own house . The deceased was all over bloody . Q . Did she see her master do it ? Tiller . She could not be off of seeing him do it , for she took the staff out of his hand . While she was trying to get the truncheon out of Mr. Townley 's hand , Mr. Long , repeated a heavy blow upon the deceased 's leg . Q . With what ? Tiller . With a stick or a cane , I ca n't tell which - of a midling size . Q . Was he upon the ground all this time ? Tiller . Yes , for he had not power to rise . Q . Where did the last blow light ? Tiller . Upon the left leg , about the ankle bone . Q . Was it done with violence ? Tiller . Really I think it was with a very good will that Mr. Long gave it , and in a few minutes after the blow was given , the deceased said Mr. Long had broke his leg . Q . What happened then ? Tiller . Then Mr. Townley gave orders that the deceased should be carried to the Round-house . There were two men came to drag him out , and he said he could not go for his leg was broke ; then they dragged him some doors from Mr. Townley 's house , and John Gasson said , Master his leg is broke , and then Mr. Townley came and blew out my candle . Q . How far did they carry him ? Tiller . About seven or eight doors . Townley called me bitch , and bid me go home or he would do for me . Then the deceased 's wife went to fetch her young child to lie there , for she was a Prisoner . Q . How did he get to the Round-house ? Tiller . I ca n't tell , but I saw some men take him up to carry him there . Q . How far was it from the house where this was done , to the Round-house ? Tiller . I believe it is twice the length of the Old-Bailey-Yard , but I am not a judge of yards in this case . Q . What other blows were there given ? Tiller . Long gave him several blows upon the back . Q . You say the deceased 's leg was broke in Townley 's house , I ask you whether or no he complained that his leg was broke , before he was carried out of the house ? Tiller . He did indeed , and they dragged him seven or eight doors , and I pursued them with a candle in my hand ; and Townley beat the deceased with the truncheon , and said he would make him walk . Q . On what part were these blows given him ? Tiller . I believe they were upon his back . Q . During this time , did the deceased endeavour to make his escape ? Tiller . He did not . Q . Did he make any resistance ? Tiller . He did not . Q . When he was carried to the Round-house , which of the Prisoners was there ? Tiller . They ordered him to be locked up , and went away directly , they did not take any care at all of the Prisoner , and he was laid down upon the boards , and lay there for 3 or 4 hours . Q . What was done after he was carried to the Round-house ? Tiller . Luke Griffin , the man who keeps the Round-house , seeing him brought in , in such a distressed manner , went to one of the overseers of the poor to get a note to go to a Surgeon , but no Surgeon came , he laid his head upon my lap till two o'clock . I went to Townley 's , ( who is Headborough , or something else ) and said , You are a very pretty man to murder a man in your own house . Before the Prisoner was moved , I said to him , Tom Page , are you in your senses ? he said , Yes , Mrs. Tiller , I am ; said I , In case you do otherwise than well , let me know who you lay your death to ; he said , To Mr. Townley , and Mr. Long ; Mr. Long broke my leg , and Mr. Townley repeated several blows upon my legs . I agreed with two men to carry him to the Hospital ; I went along with him , and he died there the 28th of September . Pris . Council . On the cross examination . Q .

Q . Did not Townley serve the warrant that night ? Tiller . Yes , he did . Q . Was it not eleven o'clock at night , when the deceased desired to go before the Justice ? Tiller . No it was not . Q . Was it not eleven o'clock , when Mrs. Thomas was carried before the Justice ? Tiller . Mrs. Thomas was in the Round-house before ten . Q . Did not the deceased say he would not go to any Round-house ? Tiller . He only desired that he might not go , he did not insist that he would not . Q . Did not he say he would not go ? Tiller . I did not hear him say any such thing . When they were at the Round-house , Mr. Long said , shall I lock the woman up ? She has a family of young children ; and Townley said he would lock them both up . Q . When he went to make water did he say he was going to the door ? Tiller . He said he was going to make water , and Mr. Long catched hold of his coat , and called him names , as I told you before . Q . When he went to the Round-house , did he walk ? Tiller . He had not power to walk . Q . You say he was dragged out of the house , did Townley or Long drag him ? Tiller . No , I did not see Townley or Long drag him , but two men did . - It was about one o'clock . Q . Was it by Townley 's or Long 's order that the deceased was dragged along ? Tiller . It was by their order . Q . What did they say then ? Tiller . They ordered him to be carried to the Round-house , and I think Mr. Townley carried the candle , but I ca n't be positive . Elizabeth Peate . Mr. Townley and Mr. Long came and served a common warrant upon Mr . Page and his wife , they behaved very well at Page 's house , they did not insist upon taking them out directly . Q . What time of night was this ? Peate . I believe it was about ten o'clock when they took them out of the house to go to Mr. Townley 's house ; after they came to Mr. Townley 's house , Townley went out and Mr . Page thought it long that he did not come in to do them justice ; at last Mr. Townley came in and the deceased got up , Mr. Long took hold of the flap of his coat and said , D - n you you son of a bitch where are you going ? With that the deceased called him son of a bitch again , and said he was going to make water . Long said , What are you going to make your escape ? No , says he , I am only going to make water . Mr. Long took his cane and punched him several times upon the breast , and with his pushing him the deceased fell backward , and Long lays on very hard with his cane , ( I do n't know whether it was a stick or a cane , for some sticks are painted and look like canes ) then Mr. Townley went to the bar for his truncheon and laid on very hard , so , I believe it was very hard , but I did not feel the blows ; I said to the maid servant , for God 's sake , my dear , beg your master to have mercy , and the poor girl came out of the bar and said , for God 's sake Master , do n't commit murder ; then she went into the bar and he struck him again ; then the girl came out of the bar again and got the truncheon from him . Q . Where did the blows fall ? Peate . I believe they might happen upon his head . Q . Was he standing or lying ? Peate . No , he was down all the time , for they would not give him time to get up , and he could not get up . Q . Did the Prisoner make any attempt to escape ? Peate . No , he did not indeed . Q .

Q . Was you in that house that night ? Peate . Yes , I was indeed . Townley . If I was to ask her never so many questions she would swear to them all . Judith Mussell . On the 28th of September I was at Mr. Townley 's , Mr. Long and the deceased had a few words , I do n't know what : Mr. Long called him rascal , and fell a beating him with a cane ; there was a little staff which Mr. Townley had , and he struck him with it , and they repeated their blows very often . Mr. Long the Beadle broke the deceased 's leg with his walking cane , and beat him as he lay upon the ground . Q . Where was the leg broke ? Mussell . It was broke by the bar , and afterwards they dragged him to the fire side . Q . How long time was it between the beginning of this affair , and his leg being broke ? Mussell .

Mr. Townley called me bitch , and said he would rout us all , and then I went home . John Gasson . I am an assistant to the Constable of the night , he sent me to see for Mr. Long , I went to Mr. Long 's house , and they said he was at Mr. Townley 's ; I went there and the deceased was lying upon the floor bleeding , and Mr. Townley 's maid was there ( if she is the maid ) and she said to Mr. Townley , What , will you have murder done in the house ? and the Shoemaker , I do n't know his name [ Savage ] was paying off the deceased as he was lying upon the ground , and he did not stir at all .

With a cane or a stick , I ca n't tell which . Q . Did he strike him with force and violence ? Gasson . I ca n't tell . Q . Did he strike him hard or with a good will ? Gasson . I ca n't tell what you mean by striking with a good will , he struck so hard that he broke my head . Q . Was Page lying upon the floor then ? Gasson . He was lying bleeding upon the floor , Mr. Townley pushed me on one side , and asked me what I struck his assistant for , for I really did strike his assistant on the head , and I said , Murder must not be committed in the house ; I helped the deceased along as well as I could by the arm , and led him to the Round-House ; when I had got him three or four doors from the house he complained that his leg was broke - I believe it was his left leg , I told Mr. Townley I believed his leg was broke : when he was in the Round-House Mr. Townley insisted that he should be put into the hold , and the Governor said he would not put him into the hold ; and I went to one of the Overseers of the Poor to get a note to go to the Parish Surgeon to come to him ; then Mr. Long came to the watch-house , and went to sleep , and Mr. Townley went to bed . Townley . Did you know any thing of the deceased before you came into my house ? Gasson . No , I did not , I did not know any thing of the affair . Townley . Did not you strike Savage ? Gasson .

Did you hear him complain before he got out of the house ? Gasson . No , I did not . Urias Caldwell . I went into Mr. Townley 's for a halfpennyworth of tobacco , and saw the deceased lying upon the ground in the house , I had not been out of the house above a minute before I saw two men or more lugging him out of the house ; they had not lugged him above two or three doors before he fell down and could not go any farther for his leg was broke . Mr.Townley came out and said , why do n't you carry him along , and they said , Master , he says his leg is broke ; Mr. Townley said , he shams it , I 'll make him go , lift him up again , and punched him several times on the back with his short staff , and the man cried , do n't murder me ; then the men who had him under the arms pulled him a little more , then he fell down again , and the men lifted him up a second time : then Mr. Townley said again , he shams it , I 'll make him go , and punched him again about his loins with his short staff . Q . Was it done with violence or gently ? Caldwell . It was very hard to my knowledge , for I perfectly heard the sound of the blows ; a woman who is one of the witnesses came by with a candle in her hand , and he called her bitch , and said I 'll have you all by and by ; then he fell down again , and one of the men who was lugging him along clapped his hand upon his leg and said his leg was broke . Then Townley said , take him upon one of your backs and carry him to the Round-House ; when he was there a woman who had his head in her lap said to him , if you should do otherwise than well who do you lay your death to ? He said to Mr. Townley and Mr. Long , and their assistant . John Smith . I saw Page lying in the street against a pair of gates bleeding , and they were pulling and hawling him like a dog . I asked how they could serve him so , and they said he had cut them all to pieces , but I think they had cut him all to pieces ; they were swearing and cursing and said he should go , and Mr. Gasson carried him to the Round House . Q. to Tiller . Was the Prisoner in good health before he went to Townley 's house ? Tiller . He was looked upon to be a sound , wholsom , healthy man - about 41 years of age . Mr. James Phillips . May it please your Lordship and you Gentlemen of the Jury , on Wednesday the 19th of September the deceased was brought to St. Bartholomew 's hospital , and on the 28th died ; and I was in hopes there would have been a good care , for four days things went on well , but on Saturday about four o'clock the sister of the ward sent to my house to inform me that he was in convulsions ; when I saw him I was surprized there should be such an alteration in two or three hours . She said somebody had been to see him , and had frightened him and put him into a disorder , by telling him his children were carried to the workhouse . I took all the care of him that I was capable of . He had a wound in his head , and for my satisfaction after his death I opened his skull , and there was no concussion or fracture which occasioned his death . As to the leg , the fracture was so oblique that it might be done by falling down , and not by the blow of a cane . Q . Do you believe the wound on his head was the occassion of his death ? Phillips . No , I do not think it was . Q . Was the broken leg the occasion of his death ? Phillips . I can not say it was , for I was in hopes that no dangerous symptoms appearing , he would have done well . Q . Had he a fever ? Phillips . He had from Saturday a great fever upon him , great tremor , and was delirious . Q . What was his death owing to ? Phillips . I believe it was owing to the fever . Q . Might not such usage as this produce a fever ? Phillips . Yes , to be sure it might , but be pleased to take the other circumstances with it , that he lived four days , and had all the good symptoms that could be expected . Q . Had he any fever for the first 4 days ? Phillips . No more than he ought to have , for there must be always a proper heat allowed , in order for the cure . Q . Did not this usage , in your opinion , hasten his death ? Phillips . I am ready to think , as he continued so long with good symptoms , that this fever arose from a second cause . Q . Might not a fright occasion this fever and convulsions ? Phillips . Yes , I do really think a fright might throw him into those convulsions . Q . Do you think this fright in other circumstances , would have occasioned such a fever ? Phillips . I can not assert that . Q. I ask you upon the whole , whether in your opinion , this usage did , supposing it to be true , hasten his death or no ? Phillips . Yes , I believe it did . Prisoners defence . The council for the Prisoners produced a warrant , dated 18th of September , granted to Rebecca Hampshire , [ the person who in the former part of the trial is called Elizabeth Thomas ] to take into custody Thomas and Elizabeth Page , for assaulting , wounding , and bruising her in a cruel manner . Townley . These people who have appeared against us , will swear any thing , they keep bawdy-houses in Bowl-yard , and have a spight against the Parish Officers , because they have disturbed them . Mary Winship . I am servant to Mr. Townley ; Rebecca Thomas got a warrant against the deceased , and his wife , and my master served it ; Mrs . Page desired leave to go to one Mr. Smith 's to get bail , and Mr. Townley let her go , and then she got a warrant to take up Mrs. Thomas . - Mrs . Page returned with the warrant , about half an hour after ten at night , or not quite so much , - my master returned back again about half an hour after ten ; Mr . Page desired to go before the Justice , and my master said it was too late , and desired his Readle , Mr. Long , to take him to the Round-house ; Mr . Page said he would go to no Round-house , he would be no body 's Prisoner , he would go no where but to his own habitation , was very rustical , and attempted to go away . Pris . Council . Where did he attempt to go ? Winship . He attempted to go into the street , and then Mr. Long took hold of the skirt of his coat , and Mr . Page was very rustical , snatched Long 's cane out of his hand , and struck my master with it ; that was the first blow which was given on either side ; then my master went to sit down again , and he resisted still . Q . In what manner did he resist ? Winship . He struggled , and my master struggled with him , and held him , and in came the watchman , Gasson ; then the deceased tumbled down , and fell a fighting with another man . Q . Was you present when he was carried out of the house , to the Round house ? Winship . Yes . Q . Was there any complaint before he went out of the door ; of his leg being broke ? Winship . - No . Q . Did he walk out , or was he carried out at the door ? Winship . He walked out of the house . Q . What complaint did he make ? Winship . I saw him as far as the door , and he made no complaint then . Pros . Council . Do n't you remember the deceased 's being bloody ? Winship . Yes , but nothing but his head , his leg was not bloody . I took hold of my master 's coat , and said , come away . My master had neither stick nor truncheon in his hand , till he went away with the deceased to the Round house . Mrs. Kinder . I went into Mr. Townley 's for a pint of beer about nine o'clock , when Mr . Page first came in ; Mrs . Page came in about half an hour after , and brought a warrant , and insisted upon it 's being served , and it was served by Mr. Townley . He came in again about eleven o'clock , and said Mr . Page must go to the Round house . Mr . Page was very rustical , and would not go . Mr. Townley insisted upon it , and said it was too late to go to the Justice 's ; Page said he would go no where but to his own house ; for he would be no body 's Prisoner ; then he was going to run away . Q . What way did he offer to go out ? Kinder . Out at the back door next the street . Q . Does the back door go into the street ? Kinder . Yes , Sir , he took Mr. Long 's cane out of his hand , and beat Mr. Townley over the shoulders , and took him by the ears , and almost pulled his ears off , for I was the person who put some tallow to them . Page used Townley , Long , and Savage very ill - he walked from the fire-side to the door as well as I can go - I saw him no farther than out at the door . Q . Was he carried out upon any body 's shoulders ? Kinder . He walked out as well as I can do out of this place - at the time they were going to carry him to the Round-house . Q . Did he complain of his leg being broke ? Kinder . He said his leg was broke ; but his leg was not broke in the house - if any body gave the blow it was Mr. Gasson , for he came in and began to pay away , and then they all fell a fighting and quarrelling together . Sarah Blowes . I am sister of the Ward where the deceased died , he came in the 19th of September , his leg was broke , and his head cut in to places . Q . What condition was he in for the first four days ? Blowes . From the 19th of September , which was on the Wednesday , to the Saturday , he was in a fair way . On Saturday two men and the deceased 's wife came and talked of an execution , and of some children going to the work-house , but whether they were her own or no I ca n't say . Towards candle-light , he began to be very delirious , and pulled his leg out of the box ; upon this he had a sort of a shivering , his senses were taken away , and he was quite delirious ; the bandages which were upon his leg were either rubbed off , or he had pulled them off , and I was obliged to get a person to put his leg into the box again , and it was obliged to be set a second time . Charles Rowyer . I am a patient in this hospital , the deceased was brought in on Wednesday morning about nine o'clock ; for the first 4 days to all appearance he was in a fair way of doing well . On the Saturday there was such an alteration that he was not sensible of any thing , and he had almost got his leg out of the box - I believe he untied the bandages , that was the reason we tied his hands , and his leg was set a second time . Q . What occasioned that ? Rowyer . I ca n't take upon me to say . Q . Do you think it arose from any particular accident ? Rowyer . Certainly it did - I am of the opinion with the other witness , that the disorder he was put into was the occasion of it . Prose . Council . Are you a Surgeon , that you are so good a judge in this case ? Rowyer . I only speak by report , I ca n't say any thing to it of my self . Alexander Welch . I have known Mr. Townley about eight or nine years , and take him to be one of the most inoffensive men I ever knew , he is remarkably modest . There is another circumstances in his behalf , that at the election of officers , he was reckoned by all the persons present at the vestry , to be the most unexceptionable person to serve the office of constable . As to Mr. Long , he is a man that is very well regarded among the heads of the parish , but he is a little disregarded among the inferior sort of people , because he is by his office employed to remove nusances . I take him to be a very honest man , and incapable of doing such a thing to any body that is committed to his charge . My Lord , as to the place that these people come out of , it is the most infernal part of the Parish ; I do not pretend to impeach the characters of the Evidence , but I am sure there is no good comes from thence . Mr. Young . I have known Mr. Townley fourteen years , he has as good a character as any man in England , I never heard an angry word come out of his mouth ; as to some of the witnesses against him , they are persons of ill fame , and such , as people dare hardly go out in the night time for , the place where they live is in a manner as bad as Black-Boy-Alley , I have seen Thieves come out of the deceased 's house . John Hull . Mr. Townley and Mr. Long I know very well . I have known Townley about nine years , and Long about nineteen , they are both of them persons of very good characters , and peaceable , quiet men . I have kept them company several times , I have been both Headborough and Constable , and Long was my beadle , he was with me for two years , almost every day , and he never used a Prisoner ill that I know of - I do n't know the characters of the witnesses against the Prisoners , but they live in a very bad place . Mr. Carter . I have known Townley and Long many years , their characters are very honest and just , and before this thing happened , they had always the character of peaceable men - I know nothing of the Witnesses for the Prosecutor . Humphrey Jones . I have known Townley a great many years , he is a peaceable , quiet , honest man . Thomas Bellamy . I have known Townley about 7 years , and Long about four years ; Townley 's character was always that of a quiet , peaceable man ; and Long 's is the same for what I know ; he was my beadle last year , when I was Headborough , and always behaved in a civil manner ; as to Bowl-yard , it is as bad as Drury-Lane , or Black-Boy-Alley . Mr. Harrison . I have known Long twenty years , I have had a great many hundreds of pounds of dealings with him in the Hackney-coach-way , and he always behaved as well as I desire any person to do - I do n't think he would be guilty of such barbarity as he is charged with . - Hoddy . I have known Long 23 or 24 years , he has as good a character as any person in any parish whatsoever , and always behaved as well as any man whatever , and I believe he would not be guilty of any such thing as is laid to his charge - I do n't know the witnesses for the Prosecutor , but Bowl-yard is a very wicked place . - Gibson . I have known Townley and Long many years , they are persons of very good characters . - Scot . I have known Townley between five and six years , he always bore the character of an honest man , a good husband , and an indulgent father ; he was always very good natured , and used the Prisoners he had under his care with a great deal of humanity . - Gregory . I have known Townley seven years , he has the character of an honest , quiet , peaceable man . Acquitted . 464 . + Francis Moulcer , of St. John Hackney , was indicted , for that he on the 6th of September , in the 18th year of his Majesty 's reign , upon Ann Bishop spinster , under the age of ten years , feloniously did make an assault , and her the said Ann Bishop did ravish and carnally know , and wickedly did abuse , against the form of the statute . Rachel Bishop . On the 14th of September last my child was at play with her brother ; he bid her sit down and she could not , she came to sit down by me and I saw she could not sit down . I asked her what was the matter with her , she said her backside was sore . I examined her , and found she was in a bad condition in her private parts ; I sent for the Doctor to examine her , and he said she had got the soul disease . I asked her who had meddled with her ? she said Francis Moulcer had taken her into a shed , and laid her down on the top of some hides , and pulled down his breeches and lay with her . - She said she did not know what he did to her , for she turned her head away . Q . When was this done ? Bishop . I ca n't say to the day . Q . Did the child tell you what day it was ? Bishop . She could not tell . Q . Did she tell you how long it was ago ? Bishop . She said it was the week after Edmonton statute ( which was the 2d of September ) I asked her why she did not tell me of it before ; she said she was afraid ; I asked her why ? she said that the Prisoner had threatened to cut her throat if she told any body . Q . What did she say he did to her ? Bishop . She said he laid her down and did something to her which hurt her very much , but what he did she could not tell , for she turned her head away from him . Q . What is the Prisoner ? Bishop . He worked seven or eight years with an aunt of mine , in the collar making business . Mr. Coulson Surgeon . On the 15th of September Mrs. Bishop sent for me to examine her child , and upon examination I found she had the foul disease upon her ; the Justice desired I would examine the Prisoner , to know whether he had the same disorder upon him , which I did on the 16th , and found that he was in the same condition . Joseph Wilson . On the 17th of September I received a letter from Justice Spurling , to desire me to examine this child , to see what condition she was in . I examined the child and found she had the foul disease to a very great degree . I passed my finger into the part to know whether she was injured there , and I found there had been a penetration , but not to lacerate or tear the parts . I presume he must have dilated the parts , for I apprehend the child could not have had the foul disease without the parts had been dilated in order for the emission ; had the appearance of the disease been only external , or had he not in some degree penetrated into the child 's body ; it would have appeared outwardly by an inflammation or an ulcer , and would not have been a gonorrhoea , but this is a true gonorrhoea occasioned by a penetration into the parts . Prisoner . I never entered the child 's body in any shape in my life . Mr. Wilson . Somebody must have entered her body , for I passed my finger very easily into the part , which I could not have done into the body of a child of that age , without great pain to her . Q . What age is the child ? Mr. Wilson . Eight years old . Henry Spurling , Esq ; The father of this child made a complaint to me the 16th of September in the morning about an hour before church time , and I granted him a warrant . I examined the child in what manner the Prisoner had used her , she said he took her into a shed and laid her down on some hides , and hurt her very much , but she said she did not know what he did to her , and the child told me when he had done what he did to her he threatened her , that if she told any body he would cut her throat . Mr. Coulson examined the child , and he said she had the foul disease . I examined the Prisoner with relation to this , and he said he had endeavoured to enter her body , but that he had not entered her body ; and as to his giving her the foul disease , he said he did not know he had it himself . Mr. Coulson said he had taken two doses of physick from Dr . Swift an Apothecary at Edmonton , for this disease , yet he had it upon him still . Prisoner . What I said before the Justice was when I was in liquor , for I did not offer any such thing to the child , and as for the physick I took , it was not for that , for I did not know I had any such thing upon me , and I have taken nothing for it , what I took of Dr . Swift was for a strain ; and I work as hard as any man in England to get my bread in an honest way . Guilty Death . 465. Thomas Williams * , of St. Mary Magdalen Milkstreet , was indicted for stealing a pair of shoes , val . 4 s. the goods of John Hose , Sept. 26 . * When the Prisoner was arraigned , and asked whether he was guilty or not guilty , he said , I do n't know , I think I am not guilty , I am ill once in a moon and ca n't tell whether I am guilty or no . At last , he pleaded not guilty . John Hose . Some time last month , but I ca n't be positive to the day , I lost a pair of shoes , about 11 o'clock in the day time : I was in the shop when they were lost , but did not see the Prisoner take them , my man went after him , seized him and brought him back , and the were in the bosom of his coat . John Game . I am Servant to Mr . Hose ; I saw the Prisoner take the shoes one by one off my master 's show-glass , I followed him and took the shoes out of the left side of his coat and brought him back to my master 's shop . Prisoner . I have nothing to say but this , I am out of my senses once in a moon , that I do n't know what I do . Q . Did he plead that as an excuse when he was taken ? Game . He did not say any thing to me about that when I took him , he desired nothing , but that we would use him well . Q . Do you think he looked like a man in his senses ? Game . I think he did not look like a man in his senses , to take the shoes in the day-time and come by the door with them . Mr . Hose . I saw the shoes in his bosom before he was brought back to the shop . Q . Do you think he looked like a man in his senses ? Hose . I do n't think he looked any wise like a man that was out of his senses . Guilty 10 d. [ Whipping .

There was no indictment produced against him by the Coroner . Thomas Dadley . I am a watchman of Portsoken Ward , on the 21st of August last , I was beating the hour of 11 o'clock , some men were coming along , and one of them struck my lanthorn with his stick - I do n't know who did it . Q . How many of them were there ? Dadley . I believe about ten . Q . Where was this done ? Dadley . In Aldgate High-street ; when he struck my lanthorn , I asked him what he hit my lanthorn for , upon that one of them came up to me and threw me down ; I called out to the watch to assist me ; as soon as I got up , one of the watchmen , ( Cartwright by name ) said , there is one of them gone up Checquer-yard , let us make sure of him ; we went up Checquer-yard , and some of them followed us up the yard , but he got away . I lost my staff , one of them with a cutlass , or a hanger , offered to strike me over the head . Sparkes had several cuts upon his head , he was cut very much , and his arms and wrist were very much bruised . Q . Where was he carried that night ? Dadley . He was carried home , and the next day he was carried to the London infirmary . Lancelot Howlett . On the 21st of August , about 11 o'clock at night , I was in the watch-house , and hearing a noise in the street , I went out ; Dadley , he cried out murder ; I went to his assistance , and found him upon the ground , upon his breech , and helped him up . Q . Was there a great number of people there ? Howlett . There was a great possy of people with hangers drawn - I believe about 10 or 11 , but I ca n't be sure in the dark . We began to play with our staves as well as we could , and then Cartwright , another watchman , came out , and played away . Parker , and Appleby a poor , honest , innocent man , were cut down at once . Q . How many were there of you ? Howlett . There were six of us in all , Dadley , Sparkes , Cartwright , Parker , Appleby , and my self . Q . Did you distinguish any of the persons that were there ? Howlett . Yes . Q . Who did you distinguish ? Howlett . Mr. Morgan . Q . Did you know him ? Howlett . He kept the tap at the Bull-Inn , I have known him about three years . Q . Do you consider what you say , this is a very material case , whether he did any thing , or whether he was only a looker on ? Howlett . When Parker , Sparkes and Appleby were knocked down , Morgan pursued me , and I jumped over Mr. Appleby , and Morgan was flourishing his stick at me , but being pretty nimble , I got out of the way , and I bid Appleby go into the watch-house , for he had got enough already . Then I saw Mr. Rawlinson , a Tallow-chandler , come to my assistance ; one of the watchmen was going to knock him down ; and I said , What are you going to do , do n't meddle with him , I know him . Morgan was flourishing one of the watchmen 's staves and said , You villains , what will you do , I will knock your brains out ? Q . How long was this after the watchmen were knocked down ? Howlett . About a quarter of an hour . Q . How do you know it was Morgan ? Howlett . When Morgan was flourishing the staff , I asked Rawlinson , who that was , that was flourishing his staff , and he said it was Morgan , who keeps the Seven Stars in Whitechapel - Morgan said , You wicked vile Rascals , if you come up I 'll knock your brains out . Q . What was the meaning of this , did you give them any provocation ? Dadley . No , one of them that was in company hit my lanthorn , and I said , Why do you use me so ? Q . Was there any quarrel ? Dadley . There were some fractious words ; I might say some , and they said some again . Q . When these people came up , did you see Morgan among them ? Dadley . No , I did not see him . - Cartwright . On the 21st of August , I was at the watch-house , and hearing an outcry of watch , I came out and saw several men , either with sticks , or other weapons , assaulting Thomas Dadley ; he cried out , he was down , and I went to see whether the person had a hanger , or a stick in his hand . I went to a public house to get some assistance , and was knocked down again . I went to make sure of one that went up Checquer-yard , and we knocked him down . They beat me in a terrible manner , but it was so dark , I could not see who they were . Q . What did you knock the man down for ? Dadley . Because they knocked me down several times . Thomas Rawlinson . I was invited by Mr. Baker who keeps a public house where these persons dined , to dine there ; I told him I could not be there at dinner upon account of business , but would be there in the evening ; we all came out of the house together about eleven o'clock . I said to Mr. Morgan will you go home with me and drink a bottle of cyder , which he agreed to do , for I found the company ( who were some of the crew belonging to Commodore Anson 's ship the Centurion ) were in liquor , and I did not care to keep them company . As Morgan and I were going quietly along , I heard a cry of watch , upon this outcry I saw one of the watchmen come running , and another after him , and they run down Checquer-Yard . I did not go down the yard but stood at the end of the passage , and heard a cry of murder ; the lieutenant , I forget his name now , stood at the end of the place ; the watchmen came up to the lieutenant and he had his hanger drawn , I said do n't cut any body , he said . - d d - n them I 'll fight for my King and Country . Prosecutor 's Counsel . Did you see Morgan then ? Rawlinson . No , I did not ; I do n't know what became of him . Q . Did you see him afterwards ? Rawlinson . I saw him come down the Butcher-Row in Whitechappel with a stick in his hand . Q . What sort of a stick was it , was it a watchman 's staff ? Rawlinson . I do n't know what it was , whether it was a stick or a staff . - I ca n't tell what it was for I did not see it . Q . You must see it , or you could not tell whether he had any or no ? Rawlinson . Indeed I did not know what sort of a stick it was ; then two of the watchmen came up , and one of them said he would knock me down , and the other said do n't knock him down . - This was as I was standing at my own door . Howlett was one of the watchmen that came up to me . Prisoner 's Counsel . Do you know any of the persons concerned in thi s fray ? Rawlinson . I know none but Morgan and Harding . Q . You spoke of a lieutenant ? Rawlinson . Yes , they said he was a lieutenant . Prisoner . Ask Mr. Rawlinson when the fray began , how far he and I were distant from the place where it began ? Rawlinson . I believe we were arm in arm at that time , I take it to be about 40 yards from the place where the fray was . Rob Robinson . I had been beating my rounds in Houndsditch , and hearing a noise I went into High-street , when I came to Black-Horse-Yard I crossed the way , and saw Mr. Rawlinson with a French horn hanging upon his shoulder , and one of the watchmen came up to him and said , What are you one of the gang , and went to strike at Rawlinson ; but I told him he was a neighbour and a housekeeper , and desired he would forbear . While I was talking Mr. Morgan ( as they said it was ) came flourishing his staff in his hand and bid them defiance , and retired directly towards the bars . Q . Did you know him ? - Robinson I was eight or nine yards off , and I could not distinguish him at that distance . Q . What sort of a staff was it ? - Robinson . I think it was a watchman 's staff . Q . Was it after the watchman offered to strike Rawlinson that Morgan came up ? - Robinson . Yes , it was afterwards . William Day . I am Beadle of Portsoken Ward , I was not present at the fray , but the day after this fray happened I went to Morgan 's house , and told him I heard he had been in this fray and was very sorry for it ; he said he was in the fray but it could not be helped : he said one of the company had been a good customer to him , and had hired his horse to go to Portsmouth , and he had engaged him to be there ; he said I did a foolish thing in bringing a staff away . Q . Did he say he took it from any body ? Day . He said he saw several staves lying upon the ground , and he thought it was a fray among the Butchers , and that the staff belonged to one of them ; and he said he neither gave nor received a blow from any body , and shewed me his head to let me see that he had not received any blow : said he , do you think I would engage in such an affair as this ? I said in an engagement they are not all killed , one falls on one side , and another on the other side , and a man in the centre may stand : he owned that he had a staff in his custody , and a scabbard of a hanger . I desired he would let me see them ; he said he could not let me see them then , for his wife had them and she was not in the way , but I never could get the fight of them : I desired he would not let the scabbard go by any means , for it must be produced in Court . I asked him how many hangers there were , he said he was sure there was but one ; I said there must be more than that , for we had got two . I advised him not to fly for it , but whenever the warrants were issued out to surrender himself , but he did not . Eleanor Sparkes . I attended my husband in his last moments , and asked him if he knew any of the persons who had done him the injury , and he said the man at the Seven Stars [ Morgan ] and the man at Stepney [ Harding ] had done his business for him , and that he was a dead man . Mr. Harrison , Surgeon . I was present at the London-Infirmary at the time Sparkes [ the deceased ] was brought in : there was one Dadley and a third Watchman brought in as wounded in this skirmish ; one of them had a broken skull . The Deceased had two wounds , one on the fore part of his head , a little above the ear ; that was the wound his death was principally owing to : the other wound was on the back part of the head , but of no great consequence . - He was brought into the Infirmary the 22d of August , and died the 6th of September of those wounds . Q. to Howlett . Did you see Rawlinson there ? Howlett . Yes . Q . Had he a french-horn ? Howlett . Yes . Q . When the Watchman came up to Rawlinson , when he had the french-horn , and offered to knock him down , was that before or after the fray ? Howlett . It was after the fray was over . Q. to Rawlinson . Did you and Morgan come out of the house together ? Rawlinson . Yes . Q . Did Morgan leave you before the outcry ? Rawlinson . No . Prosecutor 's Counsel . Was Appleby knocked down upon the first outcry of murder , or when ? Howlett . It was upon the second outcry of murder - after Dadley had called out murder - when Sparkes was knocked down , he was pretty near to Appleby . Morgan . Ask Howlett , whether he has not declared in several publick-houses , that he would hang me without Judge or Jury . Howlett . No , I never said so . How could I say so , when it is not in my power ? Q . Did you say so , or no ? Howlett . I never did say so . Morgan . I can prove he said he would hang me without Judge or Jury . James Leveret . That man , they call him Dumpling , but his name is Howlett , I think about 2 or 3 days after this misfortune happened , I was saying that the Prisoner is a very honest man , and it is a pity such an accident happened to him . He happened to hear what I said , and said , D - n you , what do you mean by taking part with such a rogue as he is ? I thought by that he was no friend to Mr. Morgan ; and I said , I believe you are no friend of his . He said , No , damn him ; I would hang him without Judge or Jury . Mr. Ashley . Mr. Morgan is a well-disposed man , a man , that I believe would not swear an oath ; he is the most peaceable man of any in the world ; never any bore a better character . I deal with him . Mr. Fuller [ the brewer . ] I have known him personally about three quarters of a year , and he always , to my knowledge , behaved in a sober , regular manner , as an honest , quiet , industrious man , and bore an exceeding good character . Mr. Wright . I have known him about a year and an half . He is a peaceable , quiet man , I have heard so before I knew him : he bears a very fair character . I was in the Infirmary while the Watchmen were ill there , and asked them , how they came by their hurt ? They said it was by some of the men of war 's men belonging to the Centurion . Thomas Hitchcock . I have known the Prisoner about 6 or 7 years . He bore the best of characters . I never heard him swear , nor saw him fuddled in my life . He is a quiet , inoffensive man . Reuben Harding . I live within half a score doors of him : I have known him 8 years : his character is that of a sober , honest , sedate man . Mr. Overbury . - I kept the Castle in Fleet-street . I have known him 3 years ; and during that time he behaved as a quiet , peaceable , inoffensive man . Acquitted . 467 . + James Page , of St. Andrews , Holbourn , was indicted for assaulting John Dennis on the King 's high-way , putting him in fear , and taking from him 2 s. 1 d. his property , Aug. 12 . John Dennis . About the middle of August last the Prisoner and another man assaulted me at the end of Chick-Lane about 11 at night . The Prisoner knocked me down , and another struck me over the head . I called to the Watch , but the Watchman would not take charge of them . They assaulted me twice ; first at the end of Black-Boy-Alley , and afterwards at the end of Chick Lane . After I was knocked down , the Prisoner put his hand into my pocket , and took out 2 s. and a penny . He held something like a cutlass over me , and said , if I spoke a word , wo betide me . Q . Where did you apprehend the Prisoner ? Dennis . Mr . Foot had him in custody , and insisted upon my prosecuting him . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Dennis . I have known him a great while , but it was only by seeing him go by . Q . What business are you ? Dennis . I follow Musick now , but I am a Joiner by Trade . Q . How came it you did not take him up , as you knew him so well ? Dennis . I heard that he was gone for a Marine . Prisoner . I have known the Gentleman these 3 months : he used to come to my house , and play upon musick , and used to beg for money , and I would not give him any , so I suppose he swears against me for that . Ellis Crafts . The Prisoner lives in a very honest way , and gets his bread by what he can - He goes of errands , or drives sheep , or does any thing in an honest way . He is forced to live where he can . I am a shoemaker in Beech-Lane . Mary Crafts . I have known the Prisoner several years . He is willing to do any thing , go of errands , & c. He was pressed , and carried among the soldiers , but was taken up for this . Cath . Page . The Prisoner is my own brother . He was pressed for a soldier , but they sent him to Bridewell . I went to see him there , and asked him what he was taken up for ? He said he could not tell . But they said he was taken up for a street-robbery . I never knew that he was guilty of any such thing . James Dicker . I am a founder . I live on Saffron-hill . The Prisoner used to run of errands , or drive sheep . John Day . I am a servant to Mr. How in the Old-Bailey . - I know nothing of the Prisoner . All I have to say is with relation to what the Prosecutor said . I heard him say to day , he did not know the Prisoner ; he said he was like the man , but he could not swear to the person . Dennis * . This man desired I would not swear against the Prisoner . He said , what signifies taking the man 's life away ? you may say you are not sure he is the person . * A person said that Dennis the Prosecutor was tried at the Old-Bailey , 13 years ago , for the murder of his Wife . Another Witness . The Prisoner has been tried here before for a robbery . He is one of the Black-Boy-Alley Gang , and has no visible way of living . Acquitted . James Page was a second time indicted for assaulting Mary the wife of John Dennis , on the highway , putting her in fear , and taking from her three halfpence , the money of John Dennis , Aug. 12 .

The record of his conviction was produced , setting forth , that on the 8th of April , 1741 , he was convicted of stealing 18 s. 9 d. the property of William Shipman . Then the record of his receiving judgment of transportation for 7 years , was produced and read . Eliz . Holmes , who was evidence against him in 1741 , was produced , but could not be positive he was the identical person . John King , who was also an evidence against him in 1741 , said , he could not be positive to his person , for he thought the other was of a fairer complexion ; but being afterwards asked , whether the person he was evidence against at that time had but one eye , [ as is the case of the Prisoner ] he said he believed he had but one eye . Stephen Mcdaniel proved the taking him upon Ludgate-Hill , and that he showed him the certificate of his conviction ; that he said , it was his misfortune , and he could not help it . He said , he was employed as a butcher in America , and lived very well , but could not be easy till he returned to his native country ; that he made his way up to a river , which he swam over , and catched a squirrel , on which he lived for 3 days . His aunt would have given ten guineas , if nobody would appear against him . Guilty , Death . 469.
