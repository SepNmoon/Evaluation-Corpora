Giles Spooner depos 'd , That he gave each of the Prisoner 's Horses half a peck of Beans ; and when they mounted as he held the Horses in his Hand , Ogilby took the Bay Horse , and in about 10 Minutes after they were gone , a Man came and gave him Notice of their being Highwaymen , and he pursued and gave Notice to Simon Ravenor , and he took them . The Prisoners both deny 'd the Fact , and Ogilby pleaded that he was invited by Larwood to go with him to Windsor , to an Aunt , of whom he expected to have had some Money , and that he offered to find him a Horse to go with him , and that about 3 Miles off , near Eaton , Larwood began to be melancholy , and he asking the Reason , he told him , it was because he could get no Money of his Aunt , and that he left him at Langley , that himself went to the Ram-Inn at Uxbridge , and there happended to meet with the Evidence - Pritchard , and they rode directly for London . That being drinking at Hillenden , a Man came upon a Grey Horse in a great Hurry , and as they were drinking on Horse-back at the Door , the Man said , he had had good Luck , and had found a good Foundling , and pull 'd out a Handkerchief , a Housewife and Cork-screw , and a Silver Snuff-box , with a Mother-of-Pearl Top , & c. and saying he did not matter keeping them , and offered to sell them for half a Guinea , which he gave him for them , in Proof of which he call 'd one - Pritchard , a Chocolate-maker , near Aldgate , who depos 'd the same that Ogilby had pleaded , as to his buying the Snuff-Box , & c. but he being ask 'd by the Court , whether this Man that sold Ogilby the Snuff-Box , & c. was not the Prisoner Larwood ? He reply 'd , he could not say whether it was he or not .

John Meah depos 'd , That the Prisoner brought the Bond to him , desiring him to lend him 10 l. upon it , offering to give him 10 s. to do it ; that he told him he had not Money of his own to do it , but he would carry him to a Friend that could do it , and did so ; but his Friend scrupling to do it , unless the Giver of the Bond owned it to be real , he went and enquired of Mr. Holme himself , who positively denying his Knowledge of the Bond , or his being indebted in any Sum of Money to the Prisoner , he got him apprehended . John Stokes depos 'd , That he made the Bond by the Direction of the Prisoner , and that when he came for it , he asked him for the Person who was to execute it ; that the Prisoner reply 'd , he was to meet the Gentleman in the City , and he would get it sign 'd , seal 'd , & c. there , and not give him the trouble of executing of it . Mr. Holme appeared in Court , and positively deny 'd that he gave the Bond , nor did the Hand-writing in the Bond appear any thing like the Hand of Mr. Holme , but seem 'd rather to be the Hand of a Woman , whose Name was to it as a Witness , which was Margaret Brown , nor was the Name right spelt , being Homes instead of Holme ; several Names to Receipts written by Mr. Holme were produc 'd in Court , which did no ways agree with the signing of the Bond .

The aforesaid JOHN MOORE has lately prepared two Anti-Scorburick Medicines , being Pills and a Spirit , which excel any Thing yet offered to the Publick , with a Purge given at proper Times with it : It expels the numerous Trains of Scorbutic Symptoms ; and as the Hypochondriac and Hysteric Illnesses have their Source from the Scurvy it relieves them ; it alters and changes all the Juices in the human Body , thins the Lentor , viz . that sizy , viscid , coagulated Part of the Blood , which obstructs the Capillary Vessels , and is the Cause of Chilness in the extream Parts , as well as Heat in Hypochondriac and Hysteric Paroxysms , renovates the Blood , restores decay 'd Nature , chears the Heart , revivers the Spirits , and opens Obstructions of the Viscera , gives Rest to weary , tired and worn out Bodies , it invigorates and inkindles again the almost extinguish 'd natural innate Heat , making the Vital Flame to burn clear , removing Weaknesses and Indispositions , and restoring the Pristine Health . The Symptoms are cutaneous Eruptions , as red , yellow or black Spots upon the Arms and Legs , as small as Flea-bites , sometimes as large as a Crown-Piece , and sometimes the Limbs are beset with rough scaly Swellings , oftentimes there is an itching of the Skin , which is frequently taken for what is vulgarly call 'd the Itch . The Scurvy perverts the Lympha , and is a mortal Enemy to the nervous System ; for Scorbutick Persons are troubled with Weariness , Weakness , Sense of Weight , and a dull obscure Pain in the Limbs , the Appetite is either too stimulating or too languid , the Gums are liable to Excrescences , Swellings and Ulcers , and when rubb 'd void either a saltish Blood or serous Humour , the Teeth are loose and corroded , the Mouth has a Stench ; the Spittle is very salt and sometimes acid , they are likewise affected with nocturnal Sweats , difficulty of Breathing , wandering Pains , a fat Skin is found sometimes swimming on the Top of the Urine ; but all these Symptoms are rarely found in the same Person .

An ADDRESS to the GENTLEMEN , By Dr. GREGORIUS , ( Noted for his Skill in Surgery and Anatomy , as well as Physick and Chymistry ; ) WHO having observ 'd the frequent Advertisements in the News Papers , of one and another single Medicine , said to cure all sorts of Gleets , and Seminal Weaknesses , which their Authors consound together , as if there were no Difference between them , has been prevail 'd upon , by his Friends , in this publick Manner , to inform , and undeceive those who have unwarily been brought into either , ( or both together , as it sometimes happens ) of these perplexing , draining Imbecilities . That where the Gleeting is only from a Laxity of the Glands in the Urethra , what leaks and drills away insensibly from them , through the Urinary Passage , and spots or smears the Linen , though it be yellowish , yet being without Pain , or any ill-condition 'd Disorder , is no more than Mucus , and must be cured one Way . And where it is a Seminal Weakness , that which slips away involuntarily , though it be thin , watery , and unelaborate , either by itself , in the Day-time , or a Nights too frequently , or profusely in the Sleep , or with the Urine , or upon Stool , whether from an Acrimony , or Depravity of the Juices , or by over-straining the Spermatick Vessels , or both , is Seed , and is to be remedied another way , in as much , as that Medicine which will cure the one , will not cure the other , and ( vice versa ) as every Practitioner that known the Nature , Make , and different Situation of the Parts ministring to Generation , will all ow ; and that for want of this due Distinction , and right Application , it is , that so many People are disappointed of Cure ; and by continuance of the Gleetings , are drain 'd , as they are , into Impotencies , or Infertilities , which as it hinders their marrying , gives 'em great Anxiety , and the more , when attended , as in some , with Pain and Weakness in the Back and Reins ; or , as in others , with Difficulty , or Dribblings of the Urine in , or after making it , which at length comes away either foul , sharp , slimy , or of an ill Smell . As this is so in Fact , and the Dr. Well known to have experienc 'd , in numberless Instances , the noble and never-failing Effects of two particular Balsamick Electuaries , which he spared no Pains or Expence to find out , the one to restrain the Mucus , and the other the involuntary shedding of the Seed , by their respectively branching up the Fibres , and restoring the Tone and Springiness of the relaxed Glands and Seminals , invigorating the Genitals , and fertilizing the Seed , was also perswaded to recommend their Use , that those , who , for a long while together , had tried other Medicines for the same Weaknesses , and by their not succeeding , concluding themselves incurable , might be convinc 'd by their speedy Amendment and Recovery by these that it was not the Incurability of their Malady , but the wrong Method they had been in for Cure . But yet in either of the said two Weaknesses , or where it happens that they are complicated , and have proceeded , either from Self-abuses , excessive , or over-straining Coltions , or from over Purgations in Venereal Cures , or any other Cause , as a Flux of Humours generally falls down and settles upon all weakened Parts , rendring them still the weaker , and these tender nervous Parts more especially . The first Step to be taken in order to make way for a regular and substantial Cure , ( and without which it is not to be accomplished ) must , in a peculiar Manner , be to correct , and gently divert those Humours ; and the only Medicine he could ever reply upon to do this effectually , that is , to overcome the Cause , and introduce the Cure of the most difficult of these Weaknesses , ( even where the Vessels had been obstructed , Manhood greatly enfeebled , and in some , well high extinct , or at least not able to touch a Woman , but ad primum labiorum contactum , semen emittunt ; ) has been his Preparing Pills , of which when the Patient has taken only three Doses , at due Distances he is to begin ( and not before ) with one or t'other ( or both together , as the Case may chance to be ) of the said two Electuaries , which how to distinguish in , and how to proceed with , the printed Directions , wrap 'd up with the Pills , do so plainly shew , that no Persons , even of the meanest Capacities , can be at any Loss to understand them ; but will by their observing the easy Rules therein laid down , have their Blood and whole Body well cleans 'd and purified , the debilated Parts strengthened , and by Degrees , compleatly , and lastingly invigorated and restored , so as to be enabled quickly , and safely to Marry , without the least Need of any further , or other Advice or Medicine . They are to be had , Price 7 s. 6 d. the Box , sealed up , ready to be delivered to any Messenger , upon only asking for , a Box of Pills , at Mr. Payne 's , a Bookseller , at the Crown , facing the Chapter Coffee-House , in Pater noster-Row .
