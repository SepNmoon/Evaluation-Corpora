After the Council for the Prosecutor had opened to the Court the Heinousness of the Crime , and the Methods the Prisoner had taken to abuse the Credulity and good Nature of Mr. Hall , pretending he was a Spanish Merchant , and had great Effects abroad , tho ' in Reality he was no other than an idle Person . Mr. Hall depos 'd , That he hapned to lodge in the same House with the Prisoner , who ask 'd him to lend him Money , which he said he would readily do , upon good Security ; the Prisoner then shew 'd him this Bill of Lading , and insinuated himself so far into his Affections , that he told him , if this Gold was insur 'd , he would freely lend him the 200 l. he desired ; upon which Kerney , tho ' it was but a counterfeit Bill of Lading , had his pretended Effects , in the Sea-Horse , insur 'd , and brought Mr. Hall the Policy , who immediately lent him the 200 Pounds , upon a promissary Note , and the Obligation of the Bill of Lading ; but Kerney trifling in his Promises and Accounts , which he gave Mr. Hall , occasion 'd him to look narrowly into the Affair , when he found it all a Cheat and Delusion , and charging Kerney with it , he left his Lodgings the same Night , and absconded ; but Mr. Hall being industrious in his Inquiries after him , heard he was gone to Tunbridge , to take his Pleasure , and going their in Pursuit of him , found him at the Beggars Opera .

He told a tedious Tale in his Defence , but to very little Effect ; for he could neither alledge one Truth in his Vindication , nor shew a single Circumstance which might serve to mitigate his Crime , the Jury found him Guilty of the Indictment .

[ Transportation . See summary . ] William Hales , of St Dunstan 's in the West , was indicted for a Misdemeanor , in Counterfeiting and Forging , a certain Writing , with intent to defraud Thomas Gibson , Esq ; and other his Majesty 's Subjects , on the 7th of September last , which Note he knowing to be false and Counterfeit , did publish as a true Note , on the said 7th of September last . The Copy of the Note was as followeth : Aug. 27 , 1728 . I promise to pay to George Watson , Esq ; or Order , the Sum of Six Thousand four hundred Pounds upon Demand , the like Value received ; for myself and Partners . Thomas Gibson . After the Council for the King had opened to the Court the heinousness of the Crime , and the Reasons they had to believe by their Instructions , that William Hales was guilty of Counterfeiting , Forging , and Publishing the abovementioned Writing , they proceeded to examine the following Witnesses . Mr. Philip Booth depos 'd , That he had known Mr. Hales for some Time , and that about a Year and a Half ago he came to him ( he being a Servant to Mr. Gibson , who is a Member of Parliament ) and desired he would get him two Letters Frank 'd , for the Gentleman who us 'd to Frank his Letters was gone into the Country ; he then gave this Deponent two Sheets of large Paper , folded up in a large Size for Letters , and desired they might be directed to Robert Booth , Esq ; at Bristol , which was accordingly done by Mr Gibson , who , as his Manner was , wrote the Directions himself , and under the Directions he wrote Free Tho Gibson . The Counterfeit Note of 6400 l. Sign 'd Tho Gibson , being shew 'd to this Deponent , it was his Opinion that the Contrivance was manag 'd by the help of one of those Letters Mr. Gibson Frank 'd for Mr. Hales ; he likewise discovered that the Word for , where it was in the Note for myself and Partners . was partly eras 'd , and that between the f and r an o was crowded in , and the two ee 's being rubb 'd out , the Word Free as it was wrote by Mr. Gibson , was made for , to which w as immediately added , myself and Partners , he likewise observ 'd ( and it was observ 'd by the Gentlemen of the Jury ) that the Letter o , crowded between the F and r , and the Words myself and Partners , were of different Ink from the Name Thomas Gibson ; and tho ' it faintly imitated Mr. Gibson 's Hand , and was different from the Body of the Note , yet he who was well acquainted with Mr. Gibson 's Hand , could plainly discover it to be a Counterfeit , and only the ff , which was Mr. Gibson 's Way of writing when he wrote Free , and the Name Tho Gibson , was Mr. Gibson 's own writing , he further took Notice , that the Stile and Manner of this Note differ 'd not a little from the Manner of Mr. Gibson 's writing a Promissory Note , for as in this it was myself and Partners , Mr. Gibson always writes , for myself and Co. for Company , and Mr. Gibson never uses the Phrase for Value received , as it was wrote in this counterfeit Writing : Other Remarks were made , that over the m for my , there appeared the Bottom of the two ee 's , which made but a bungling Figure in the Counterfeit Note , tho ' it was not observ 'd by the Gentleman who gave his Notes in exchange for it at the Time of his receiving it , the Piece of Paper on which this Note was drawn , appeared to have been cut or torn to serve the Design , and it seem 'd ridiculous , to think Mr. Gibson should draw a Note of such Consequence upon such a diminutive scrap of Paper ; besides , the Note seemed to have been folded as a Letter . Robert Booth , Esq ; of Bristol , depos 'd , That he never received a Letter either Frank 'd or otherwise , from Mr. Hales , and that there was no other Person in Bristol but himself , who went by the Name and Title of Robert Booth , Esq ; Thomas Romsey depos 'd , That he had been acquainted with Mr. Hales for above a Year , but in particular , from last June to the 7th of last September , when being at the House of Mr. Hales in Duke-street , Westminster , and having on a light Coat , with a red Waistcoat and Breeches , and a broad open laced Hat , Mr. Hales bade him put himself in a different Dress , naming a Suit of plain Cloth , which this Deponent had by him , and because he had never a Hat but what was edg 'd with Silver , Mr. Hales bade him put on a plain Hat of his , and when he had thus dress 'd himself , Mr. Hales ask 'd him to go with him into the City , and by the Way brought him a Pocket-Book , or Case for Notes , but before he proceeded further , to make him look still more like a Man of Business , Mr. Hales went with him to Middle-Row in Holborn , and bought him a dark Wig , which he gave him to put on , and bade him put his light Wig in his Pocket ; this done , they went together to John 's Coffee-House in Sheer-Lane , where they had not been long before a Porter came , to whom Mr. Hales address 'd himself , and ask 'd if he did not want Mr. Romsey , the Porter said , Yes , and delivering a Letter , Mr. Hales gave it to Mr. Romsey , this Deponent , and bade him open it , which he did , and found this counterfeit Note ( for it being shew 'd to Mr. Romsey , appeared to be the very same ) in los 'd therein , and in the Body of the Letter was only wrote , to the Lady Harriot Elliot 4300 l. and to Sir John Hind Cotton 2100 l. under which , Mr. Hales bade him write , to James Moreton , Esq ; or Bearer 70 l. which he did , and then Mr. Hales gave him three Bank Notes , one of 40 l. and two of 25 l. each , which , with the Counterfeit Note of 6400 l. he put into the New Pocket-Case , with the Names aforementioned tore out of the Letter , and bade him go to Mr . Snow 's , the Banker ( whose House he shew 'd him , and kept in View ) and desire they would change those Notes for Notes of their own , and make them payable to the Persons to whom the other Paper directed , in such Sums as their mentioned : With these Notes and Directions he went to Mr . Snow 's Shop , and first shew 'd the Bank Notes , which Mr. Poultock readily chang 'd as desired ; after which , he pull 'd out the 6400 l. Note , and desired Mr. Poultock to exchange that , but he refus 'd it , saying , It was not all Mr. Gibson 's Hand-Writing , and he would not meddle with it . He then went again to Mr. Hales who stood at some Distance , and told him of the Success he had met with ; and Mr. Hales went with him again to John 's Coffee-House , in Sheer-Lane , where Mr. Hales ordered him to write on a Piece of Paper , to Sir Richard Grovesnor , 4300 l. and to Sir John Hind Cotton , 2100 l. from whence Mr. Hales went to shew him Mr. Hoare 's Shop , telling him , if he could he should get the Notes of Mr. Hoare and Comp . payable to Sir Richard Grovesnor and Sir John Hind Cotton . He likewise gave him another Note , of about seventy Pounds , to exchange there , and ordered him , if they should ask his Name , to say it was Fowler ; at this Place he got the Notes chang 'd , for the Notes of Hoare and Comp . Mr. Hales waiting at a Fruit-Stall , hard by ; they took Coach , and went directly to the Change , and from thence to Janeway 's Coffee-House , where Mr. Hales bade him write 1100 l. and 1200 l. payable to Samuel Palmer , Esq ; or Bearer , and sent him to Mr. Woodward 's , to change the Notes , he had before taken at Mr. Hoare 's , for Notes of Mr. Woodward 's , to be paid to Samuel Palmer , Esq ; with Directions as before , to call himself Thomas Fowler ; and if ask 'd after Mr. Palmer , to say , he lived in Mansfields-Street , Goodmans-Fields ; but Mr. Woodward 's Door being shut up , Mr. Hales sent him to Mr. Bracey 's , where he got the Notes payable to Mr. Palmer , and in Lien , gave the other Notes he had before received at Mr. Hoare 's . This being Saturday Night late , they went together to Mr. Hales 's , where Mr. Romsey lay , and Mr. Hales bid him be ready on Monday Morning , in the same Dress , which he accordingly was , and went with Mr. Hales again to Jansway 's Coffee-House , when Mr. Hales sent him to Mr. Alderman Hankey 's and exchang 'd Notes there , and from thence to Mr. Halsey 's , to turn these several Notes into South-Sea and India-Bonds , which were afterwards converted into Bank Notes , when the Produce of the 6400 l. had been wound about into several Intricacies . Mr. Hales had all this while an other Emissary at Work , getting off some of the Bank Notes , who had better Success than Mr. Romsey ; for he going to the Bank , with two Notes of 200 l. each , was stopp 'd , the Affair being found out by Mr. Gibson 's Cashier , to be a vile Imposition , and trac 'd to the several Places where the Affair had been transacted ; that when Romsey came to the Bank , he was taken into Custody , and Mr. Hales , who waited for him at Robi 's Coffee-House , in the Old-Jury , was taken soon after . Mr. Poultock , Mr. Richard Hoar , Mr. Turner , Mr. Hankey , Mr. Cole , Servant to Mr. Halsey , and Mr. George Lee , all confirm 'd Romsey 's Evidence , of his exchanging Notes with them , as he had depos 'd ; and Robert Hall depos 'd , That he being Mr. Hale 's Taylor , by the Order and Direction of Mr. Hales , had taken Notes and Money for him at Mr. Bracey 's , on the Monday Morning , and from thence he went to the Bank , and receiv 'd Money for the Bank Notes he receiv 'd of Mr. Bracey ; and that Mr. Hales gave him Orders , if any one should ask his Name , to say it was John Roberts , and that he lived in the Hay-Market , or any other Place he could remember . Mr. Maddox depos 'd , he had Instructions to stop any Person who should bring Notes to the Bank , of such a Number , which Notes were stopp 'd upon Romsey , who sent a Letter to Mr. Hales , at Robin 's Coffee-House , where they found Mr. Hales , and brought him to the Bank ; that he confess 'd the 6400 l. Note came from him , and what with the Money and Notes found upon Romsey , and the Money and Notes found upon Mr. Hales , there was the whole Sum of 6400 l. the Note he said he had of one Samuel Palmer , and likewise confess 'd this before Mr. Alderman Bellamy , and others . The Council for the Prisoner did not insist upon its not being a counterfeit Note , only said , as the Prisoner had been a Bankrupt those last twenty Years , and not able to obtain his Certificate , he was obliged to transact his Affairs under fictitious Names , and the Names of other People , for the Security of his Effects ; and that they should endeavour to prove , He had dealt very largely , in particular with one Samuel Palmer , of whom he had the 6400 l. Note , sign 'd Thomas Gibson . Mr. Granper depos 'd , That he knew one Samuel Palmer , who had been employ 'd by the East-India Company , and sent abroad by them , and came back again , but he could not tell where he was now nor that he ever had any Dealings with Mr. Hales . He likewise call 'd another Witness to his Character , but neither of these Witnesses speaking to the Purpose , for which they were call 'd , and the Fact appearing very plain , the Jury found him Guilty . He was a second Time indicted , for procuring and obtaining the Notes of Benjamin Hoare , and Henry Hoare , by false Tokens , to the great Damage of the said Benjamin and Henry Hoare , and the same Witnesses being call 'd , as were examined before , the Fact appear 'd plain , and the Jury found him Guilty , but his Judgement is respited till next Sessions , when he will be tried upon other Indictments . Judith Holloway , of Broad-Street , was indicted for privately stealing a silver Snuff-Box , value 12 Shillings , from the Person of Elizabeth Staples , on the 6th of November last , the Property of William Staples . Mrs. Elizabeth Staples depos 'd , That on the 6th of November , as she was coming out of St. Helen 's Meeting-House , the Prisoner press 'd very hard against her ; that she immediately put her Hand in her Pocket , and found the Prisoner 's Hand there ; that her Snuff-Box was then gone out of her Pocket , tho ' she was certain it was there but just before . Elizabeth Staples , Jun . Sister-in-Law to the Prosecutor , depos 'd , That the Prisoner press 'd very hard against her Sister , and self ; that when her Sister miss 'd the Snuff-Box , she said , That is the Woman who did it , ( meaning the Prisoner , ) and that the Prisoner said , it was not her , but a Man behind . Ann Staples depos 'd , That she was behind her Sister when she said , That is the Woman ; and that very Instant , she saw the Prisoner fling down something , and she stooping down , found it to be her Sister 's Snuff-Box . Mr. Witeman depos 'd , That he heard Madam Staples say , her Pocket was pick 'd , and that Moment he saw the Prisoner drop a silver Snuff-Box , which being produc 'd in Court , it appear 'd to be the same which the Prisoner dropp 'd , and the same which was taken out of Mr. Elizabeth Staples 's Pocket . She appear 'd to be a Person of very ill Fame , tho ' three or four appear 'd to her Character ; yet they gave such a trifling Relation of her Way of Living , as was of no Service to her . The Jury brought her in Guilty . Death . Ann Bark , John Lefever and Sarah Bricklow The Trials being ended , the Court proceeded to give Judgment as follows : Receiv 'd Sentence of Death 1.
