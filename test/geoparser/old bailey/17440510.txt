I am son to Sarah Giles in Addle Street , this hinge was lost out of the shop , and was brought to me by Mr. Pearse , who asked me , if it belonged to my mother , and I told him it did ; and the Prisoner said he took it out of the shop , and carried it to Mr. Pearse to sell . George Pearse . I am a pewterer in Whitecross Street . This lad Poole brought this brass hinge to me the 19th of April to sell . He said his father sent him to sell it , and that he had had it six years in the room . At first he said his father 's name was Weyman , but his name his Poole . He had a two foot rule in his pocket , which we gave him again , as he said he bought it for a peny in Moorfields . He said it was the first fact , and owned that he took them out of Mrs. Giles 's shop . William Rugby . I was charged with the Prisoner , and he said his father 's name was Weyman , or some such name , and was a shoemaker ; but his father 's name is Poole , and works with Mrs. Giles the founder ; he owned he had the hinge , and that he either gave a peny for the rule , or tossed up a peny against it in Moorfields . Mrs. Giles said he was a naughty boy to serve her so when she had been such a friend to him ; he said he was sorry for it , and hoped she would forgive him . Guilty 10 d.

John King . I was looking out at a one pair of stairs window , and heard my aunt cry she was robbed , and somebody said here is a boy with a bundle of linen . I went up to him , and he laid the bundle down and run away , I run after him , and took him , and he called out several times for his case of pistols to shoot me ; whether he had any gang with him I can not tell , but I saw nobody but himself ; it was pretty dark , I believe it was between eight and nine in the evening .

And Joseph Greswold for receiving the same knowing them to be stoln , April 26 . Richard Phillips . I am owner of the Montague Yatch ; the morning before this robbery was committed William Hall came and told me , that the Yatch had like to have been broke open . On the 27th in the morning he came and told me that it was broke open , that somebody had drawn the staple of the skuttle , and taken away the things mentioned in the indictment . Two or three days afterwards Mrs. Gregory came and said , she believed if such a house was searched we might find some of the things . Some people went to search the Prisoner 's house , and he said they were very welcome ; but while they were searching it he ran away , and they found a tolling and some other things in the closet , and the fails were found at the top of the house . We went before a Justice , and the Prisoner Andrew said he would own every thing , and how they came there . Then said I , how did they come there ? He answered , the man of the house where you found these things ( Greswold ) enticed us from our masters , and said we should not want for money , victuals , or clothes : one of the boys said , that Groswold sent them out o'night with tools to break open vessels , and that he received what they brought . Greswold . Do you know that I received these things knowing them to be stole ? Phillips . No otherwise than I was told . William Hall . I am master of the Montague Yatch , and have been so fifteen years . On the 27th of April in the morning I found the yatch broke open , the staple of the fore skuttle drawn , and the bar and staple carried away ; I missed a foresail , the great gib , and two cables , & c. Q . What do you call the small cable ? Hall . I call them both cables , but some people call them tollings ; - we found all of them at Greswold 's house , I found the two cables in the closet , and Greswold 's wife said she would show me two sails that her husband had bought , and I said they were mine . Q . Did Greswold stay there when you came into the house ? Hall No ; as soon as I took hold of the cable and said it was mine , he went away . William Pinfold . The 25th of April at night we went to break open the Montague Yatch , but could not do it . Q . What did you carry with you ? Pinfold . A marline spike , a hammer and hatcher . Q . Who went the first night ? Pinfold . Hodges , one Williams and I went the first night , but Hodges was not with me the last night ; George Andrew and I went the second night . Q . What did you do then ? Pinfold . Andrew drew the staple of the fore skuttle , and so broke the yatch , and took a trivet , some stanchions , some ropes , and two sails , one of them was a gib ; Andrew handed the sails up , and I helped to hand some of the other things . Q . How did you go to the ship ? Pinfold . Greswold lent us his little boat till we could get another to suit our conveniency : we used to take any large boat that we could find , and so go on board the ships ; he had bought a larger boat and brought it home from the carpenter 's the Saturday that we were taken up . Q . When you had got these things where did you carry them ? Pinfold . To Mr. Greswold 's house , and delivered the sails , ropes and stanchions , & c. to him . Q . What time of night did you go to do this ? Pinfold . The watchman went past one as we were taking them out of the yatch , which lay between Cole Harbour and Stone-Stairs . - Greswold lives at Cole-Harbour by Blackwall , and keeps the sign of the Ramsgate Pink . Q . How do you know he knew these things were stole ? Pinfold . He lent us a boat to go on board with , and enticed me away from my master ( one Griffiths a waterman and lighterman ) . He told me I might living open yatchs , and get these things and bring them to him ; I have known him about two years . Q . Where did you live when the Montague Yatch was broke open ? Pinfold . Andrew and Hodges and I lay at his house , we lay there three nights . Pris . Andrew . We lay there three nights . Q . Did you ever go on board any other vessels ? Pinfold . Yes , we carried coals to his house , which we got out of a lighter in the night time , about a week before we went to the Montague yatch - We did not lye at his house then . Greswold . Did not the officer promise you , that if you would accuse me you should be cleared ? Pinfold . No . Greswold . Did you ever bring any goods in a boat of mine , or did I ever send you about any such thing ? Pinfold . Mr. Greswold lent us his boat , he knew what we were going about . Q . Did you tell him what you were going about ? Pinfold . We told him we were going to get old ropes , or any thing we could get . James Pope . I went to Greswold 's house , and told him I had a warrant to search his house . I read the warrant to him , and he told me , I might search his house and welcome . Accordingly we did , and when Mr. Hall took hold of a rope and said , that is a piece of my cable , he walked away . I said , Mr. Greswold , do n't go ; he said he was going to look for the boy , and would be back again in a minute . I sent two men after him , and then he run into the marsh - the Isle of Dogs , which is right against his house . I went the next day to his house again to search for him , and found him covered over in a copper he used to brew in ( he used to brew his own beer ) in his shirt , without his coat and waistcoat ; there was water in it , for when he came out of the copper I was forced to stay till he changed his shoes and stockings , they were so wet . Greswold . Did you see me in the copper ? Pope . Yes , and pulled you out of the copper . Q . Was he standing up , or crouched down ? Pope . Mr. Phillips 's , people went into the out-house first and found him there . Q . Tell us how he was when you first saw him . Pope . He was standing upright in the copper . James Smith . I went with a search-warrant to Greswold 's , in order to look for Mr. Phillips 's things , there was a closet by the fire side , said I , what have you got here ? His wife said , some old ropes that we have bought , and I found them to be ours . I found some of our old fails in the garret , but his wife was not very ready to show them . The next day I went with a warrant to search for the rest of the things , for Pinfold told us where to find them . There was a woman talked pretty much , and I asked her what she had to do there ? she said , she was to take care of the house . I said , I would take hold of her . She answered , I had no occasion to do that , for Mr. Greswold was above , and as I was going up I think I saw his legs , and one of our people found him in the copper in his brewhouse ; he was stooping down , half bent , and said , if we used him well he would come out . Greswold . Did not you bring cutlasses , and say , cut him down ? Smith . I said no such thing ; I had a cutlass , it was not properly a cutlass , it was a tuck ; I was resolved indeed that he should not make his escape again . George Andrew . I lived at Greswold 's house before I knew these lads , and I used to go out in his boat a bumboating . John Eastman . I live in Leather Lane , Holborn , I have known Greswold almost from a child , I never heard any harm of him in my life , he came of very honest parents . Robert Harper . I have known the Prisoner from a child , and never heard any harm of him , I believe this is the first trouble he ever was in in his life . John Herbert . I live in Shadwell , the Prisoner has a very honest character , ( for what I know ) he keeps a publick house . Greswold . I was a distiller by trade , but have had misfortunes by informations ; I can prove that I bought them publickly of Pinfold and Andrew . Jury . What did the Prisoner give for all these things , ropes , iron , and every thing ? Pinfold . He gave us ten shillings for them ; there was about half an hundred of iron ; - it was about three o'clock in the morning when he paid us for them . Greswold . I did not think this boy would swear so roundly against me , or I would have been better prepared . Q. to Hall . What are these things worth ? are they worth 10 s. are they worth 40 s. Hall . I do n't know the value of them , they are worth 20 s. Q. to Phillips . What are all these things worth at a low price . Phillips . They are worth in all between thirty and forty shillings . Greswold . Pinfold swears a false thing , to say I gave but 10 s. for them , I gave 15 s. for them . Did you find them in my house ? Phillips . I never was in your house . Hall . The iron was found at a Smith 's , where Greswold carried it to be sold . Pope . I have known Greswold about half a year . People used to talk , that he got coals and corn in a clandestine manner : he was s uspected by all the neighbourhood before this , and every body was for suppressing his house . His father kept the house before , and it had a bad character then . Joseph Gregory . The Prisoner has been suspected of these practices ; I have heard several times that people have found their things there . Hodges acquitted , Andrew guilty , Greswold guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 247 . + Henry Cole , was indicted for that he at a delivery of the goal of our Lord the King , holden at Kingston upon Thames , in the county of Surry , on Wednesday the 21st day of March in the 12th year of his present Majesty , before Sir Lawrence Carter , Knt . & c.

The clerk of the arraigns of the home circuit produced the copy of the record of the Prisoner 's conviction , viz . On Wednesday the 21st of March in the 12th year of his present Majesty 's reign , at the assizes held at Kingston upon Thames in the county of Surry . before Sir Lawrence Carter , Knt .

Robert Lingard . The Prisoner was in my custody at Kingston assizes when he was indicted for stealing the linen for which he was convicted for transportation . I carried him up to the bar , I am sure he is the same person . Alexander Sarnel . The Prisoner was in my custody at Kingston assizes , when he was tried for this fact - I am sure he is the person - I have not seen him at large . Sarah Barton . I saw the Prisoner at my house last Borough Fair was twelvemonths , he called for a quartern of gin or anniseed , I can not tell which , ( I was in trouble for him about this linen , for which he was transported , it was found at my house ) he took hold of my hand , and said , Sall , do not be surprized at my coming back again . Q . Was there any goal-keeper with him ? Barton . There was nobody but his wife . Christian Brown . I saw the Prisoner last Borough Fair was twelvemonths , and served him with some liquor . He said to my mistress , Sall , you thought you had transported me for my life , but you see I am returned again . He sat down by my mistress , and wanted to kiss her , and she said , for God 's sake keep away - I knew him before he was transported out of the New Goal . - He had nobody with him but a woman . Prisoner . There is no such thing as disallowing this . I had no intention of returning ; we are sold there like beasts , like sheep , or oxen , and we must go with the buyer . I was sold to one Captain Loney of the Frederick Pink , and he brought me to England , or I had never come here again . Guilty , Death . 248 . + John Saunders , of St. George Hanover Square was indicted for assaulting Jeremiah Martin in a certain field , or open place , near the King 's highway , putting him in fear and taking from him a silver watch , value 50 s. a hat , value 2 s. and a perriwig , value 2 s. his property , April 17 . Jeremiah Martin . On Wednesday the 7th of April , I was going from London to Chelsea , and in a narrow passage , which we call the Five Fields , near Perrot 's illuminations , about half way between that and the Horse and Groom , between the two banks , I met Saunders the Prisoner and another person , and they bid me good night . Q . What time o'night was this ? Martin . I judge it to be about nine o'clock ; immediately after they had passed me , and bid me good night , I received a blow cross my temples , a very hard blow , but who gave it me , I can not tell ; I turned myself , and John Saunders struck at me with a stick , not so long as my cane , they call it a bludgeon , or a truncheon , it is what they use in this way . Q . Did the Prisoner strike you ? Martin . The first blow was a very severe one ; I turned about immediately , and I suppose the Prisoner struck me ; afterwards there was a second man came up with a hanger , and gave me some cuts upon my cane ; the Prisoner continued his blows , and then I received a blow with a hanger , from which I have a large wound now in my head , and I fell down into a ditch . Q . Do you know any thing further ? Martin . Yes , when I was down in the ditch , John Saunders jumped upon my knees , and I said , What do you want ? He answered , D - n your blood , your money , what do you think ? I told him I had but very little money , but if he would let me get up , I would give it him . D - n your blood , said he , I know that you always carry a watch . I said , so I did , and he took it out of my pocket . I had a pair of very strong buckskin breeches on ; he put one hand in my pocket , to tear it down , and the other on the other side . I told him I had no money there , and but very little in the other . He went to my side pocket ; I said I had nothing there but a rule ( for I am a carpenter . ) Then he put in his hand , tore it down , and took two keys , & c. out of my pocket ; and said , G - d d - n your blood , you shall never go home again ( then I believe he knew me , for I had known him about five years ) and he said he would blow my brains out ; but I did not see that he had any pistol ; when he talked of killing me , the other man said , G - d d - n you , do n't kill him , you have done enough to the man already ; with that they both went away , and left me in the ditch . Prisoner . When they went away from you , which way did they go ? Martin . They went towards London . Q . Can you tell certainly that this is the man ? Was it light then ? Martin . It was not very light , but I having known him some time before , I knew him as well as I did my own brother . I knew him by his voice , body and face ; it is surprising he should have used me in that manner , and if the other man had not been more merciful than he , I should never have been here now . John Rowe . At near 11 o'clock at night , on the 17th of April , the constable ( James Wheeler ) came and called me out , and told me , there was one Mr. Martin almost killed in the fields , and he desired me to assist him . I went along with him and three or four more into the Five Fields . The constable and some of them staid behind , and one of them went about an hundred yards before me . Presently I saw a man coming up a good pace , and he struck at me ; I had a bayonet in my hand , and I struck at him , and I believe I struck his coat , and then I cried out , stop thief . Then the constable and his man met him , and knocked him down , and we took him . Q . Who did this man prove to be ? Rowe . The Prisoner at the bar . Then I took him to my house ; when he came there , he put his hand round one of the door posts , and cried out , Murder ! and would not go in , till he was forced in . Then I asked him where he was going ? He said he was going to Esquire Man 's on the other side of the college , and that he lived with one Esquire Chester , in Golden Square ; but the next day , when Mr. Martin and we were going to Esquire Chester , to know the truth of it , he said , he did not live there . Q . When you went into the fields it was between ten and eleven , or near eleven , was Mr. Martin got home then ? Rowe . He was got home some time before ; for when the Prisoner came to my house , I sent for Mr. Martin , and as soon as he came in , he said , that is the man that robbed me , for I know him by his tongue , and he said , Mr. Saunders , how could you serve me so , when I have given you many a shilling , and many a meal 's meat when you have been out of place ; and the Prisoner denied then that he had done any thing to him . Prisoner . Ask him , whether I was the first person that met him ? Rowe . There was one an hundred yards before me . Prisoner . This Mr. Martin is an undertaker , and he buried a master of mine ; there were four servants of us , two men and two maids , and he gave us a guinea apiece ; I would ask him , whether he ever gave me any thing else ? Martin . I did bury a master of his , and I gave three guineas among the servants ; how it was disposed of , I can not tell . Q . Have you ever given him a meal 's meat ? Martin . I do n't know that I ever gave him a meal 's meat , I have given him money , and treated him when he has been out of place , when I have met him , and when we have gone in to drink , I never let him pay any thing . Prisoner . When you came into the room where I was , did not you ask me which way I got my bread ? Martin . I asked you how you lived , and where you lived ; and you would not tell me ; and if I did ask you , I had very good reason for it , for this is a bad way of getting bread . He said he was in place at Esquire Chester 's ; and when I told him I would go to Esquire Chester 's , then he said , he did not live there , but only said so ; and then he begged for mercy . James Wheeler . I happened to go over the Water Works Bridge , and saw Mr. Martin by the Two Star alehouse , and he said , that he was robbed , he did not say by who , he said , he should know the man again very well if he was to see him ; I told him , I would do any thing to serve him ; it happened to be my watch-night , and I said I would try if I could catch hold of any body . Mr. Fry was first , I said to Mr. Rowe , Do you go at such a distance ; I was the third man , and my apprentice was the next ; and we had a parson with us , but I do n't know what 's become of him ; the Prisoner met Mr. Fry , and asked him , where he was going . Q . Where was it that he met him ? Wheeler . They met about forty yards on the other side of the Horse and Groom , between that and Perrot 's illuminations , but it was nearest the Horse and Groom ; when the Prisoner asked Mr. Fry where he was going , Mr. Fry said , he was going to London ; then Mr. Rowe came , who was the second man ; the Prisoner came up to Mr. Rowe , and , to the best of my knowledge , I saw him strike . Q . Did you see the Prisoner strike Rowe ? Wheeler . Yes , I did ; with that I cried out . Here 's the villain ; I struck at him , and happened to strike him just down the back with a gun ; and afterwards came my apprentice and another person , and my apprentice knocked him down into the ditch , with the bar of a door ( which was the first thing he could light on ) and then he resisted very much , and we were afraid the other should come up ; I fired the gun at him , to make him stand , and then he went with us very quietly . Q . Where did you carry him ? Wheeler . We carried him to the Two Star alehouse , just by Mr. Martin 's . Q . Did he oppose going into the house ? Wheeler . Yes , he took hold of one of the pillars of the door , and we got him by the lock of * hair upon the top of his head , and he cried out , Murder ! and at last we got him into the house ; I told him , he must go in , or I would shoot him ; then I sent my apprentice to Mr. Martin 's , and he brought him ; Mr. Martin said , as soon as he came into the passage , the man was in the house , he knew by his voice ; and then I took the Prisoner to the watchhouse . * The Prisoner 's hair was tied up , like many of the livery servants . Prisoner . Did not I say , take what I have , and spare my life ? Wheeler . I do n't remember that ; I know I said if the law is on your side , you will be right ; but if the law is against you , you must take what it will allow you . Prisoner . He told me , there was nothing but powder in the gun , and he fired it only to frighten me . Wheeler . I did not tell him any such thing . The Council for the Prisoner offered to prove where the Prisoner was from two o'clock in the afternoon till ten at night ; and therefore if the robbery was committed at nine o'clock , the Prisoner could not be the person who committed this robbery ; that he was informed , they had used some artisices to make him confess ; but he always said , he was innocent , and that Mr. Martin sent a Romish Priest to tell him , that Mr. Martin was dead , and that he could not come to any damage , if he did confess the fact . Q. Pray Mr. Martin , did you send , or did you not send to Mr. Saunders , to let him know you was dead , and to desire that he would confess upon that account ? Martin . I did not . Q . Was you privy to any such thing ? Martin . No , I never was privy to any such thing . Jury . Pray Mr. Martin , was you in liquor at that time ? Martin . No , I was not , I was very sober ; I had been about business : they would not have meddled with me if I had had any body with me ; they had enough as it was , only they had got a hanger . Thomas Watkins . On the 17th of April , on a Tuesday , about ten o'clock in the morning , I went with the Prisoner to the Duke of , dined with Mr. Rothwell in Eagle Court , and at seven o'clock we went to Mr. Fowler 's an Apothecary in the Strand ; we did not sit down there , we came directly to my Lord Ailesbury 's ( I live with him now ) we went to the Two Chairmen in Warwick Street , and drank a pint of beer . Q . How far is that from Lord Ailesbury 's ? Watkins . It is about 100 yards from my Lord 's house . Q . What time was it when you parted ? Watkins . It was somewhat more than a quarter after eight . Q . Where was the Prisoner going then ? Watkins . He said he was going to Chelsea , and I advised him not to go ; for he was to have gone to the Duke of Graston 's the next morning , and he said he had no clean linnen in town . I never heard any thing further of him till I heard he was in Newgate . Evan Mansprit . I live with Mr. Fowler , an Apothecary , facing Beauford Buildings in the Strand ; the Prisoner and Mr. Watkins came to see me that Night-between seven and eight o'clock . Henry Buck . I live at the Two Chairmen in Warwick Street by Charing Cross ; the Prisoner was at my house the 17th of April between eight and nine at night . Q . Who was with him ? Buck . There was one or two , my Lord Ailesbury 's servant was one ; they came in between seven and eight , the Prisoner went with him to my Lord Ailesbury 's , and they came back again and staid a little while , and then said , Buck , I wish you a good night . Q . What time was that ? Buck . That was after eight , to the best of my knowledge . Jury . Was it dark when you parted from him ? Buck . Yes , I think it was ; I had lighted candles . Richard Paty . On the 17th of April , I had been at the Bun-House at Chelsea , and met the Prisoner about quarter before nine . Q . Was he walking or drinking ? Paty . I met him there under the lamp . Q . Where was you going ? Paty . I was going to one Mr. Lerose 's , to drink a pint of beer ; for I intended to leave my watch there ; we staid to drink a pint of beer at the dead wall ; and he came with me as far as Hide-Park Corner ; it was about five minutes after nine when I came from Chelsea , and I parted with him at Hide-Park Corner a quarter before ten - I have known him about ten years , he is a Gentleman 's servant ; he has been in several places , and I never heard him spoke disrespectfully of ; he lived with Mr. Hutchins at Chelsea , and I do n't think he would be guilty of any such act as this - I do n't know how long he has been out of place . Q . Did you meet any body in the Five Fields . Paty . No , there was a poor Scotsman lying among the pipes , we took him out of the ditch , and took care of him to Hide-Park Corner ; he would have made us drink , but we would not accept of it . Watkins being examined , as to the Prisoner 's character , said , he never heard any thing against his character in his life ; and that gentle and simple always gave him a good character . - Lerose . I keep the Red Lion in Chelsea ; on the 17th of April , the Prisoner came along with Paty ( Mr. Mitchell 's groom ) to my house . Q . What time did he come ? Lerose . I believe , as near as I can tell , it was about nine o'clock , or a l ittle after . Q . How far is your house from the Horse and Groom ? Lerose . A good way - it may be two miles and a quarter , if not quite , but it is very near . Q . Did he look cool , or was he at all heated ? Patey . He was not at all heated - he was not in a sweat - he was cool in his countenance - he did not look as if he had been in any violent motion . Jury , to the Constable . Was he searched , or was any thing found upon them ? Wheeler . I did search him , but I found nothing upon him ; he had private pockets about him , and though I found nothing when I searched him , he had money afterwards , for he treated me . Jury . If he had had a watch about him , and you had searched him , do you think you should not have found it ? Wheeler . I believe I should if I had searched him strictly . Jury . Was not you informed of Mr. Martin 's having lost a watch ? Wheeler . Yes . Jury . Then why would you not search to find it ? Wheeler . He had time enough to make it away before that , for I met Mr. Martin at a quarter after ten , and at the time I met the Prisoner it was nearer eleven . - Stanley , Esq ; The first time I saw the Prisoner at the bar was in February was twelvemonths , at which time I was going down to offer my services at St. Albans , and having only one servant in town , my own servant , who had known him before , recommended him to me to serve me . I had during that time more than negative proofs of his honesty ; for I sent my servant I had before , with more than 350 l. in bank notes to Mr. Child 's , to desire him to let me have specie for them : my own servant brought me 250 l of the money , and the Prisoner brought me 100 l. very honestly , and by some circumstances I believe it would have been in his power to have taken away that 100 l. My own servant being disordered by riding in the country , I kept the Prisoner about a fortnight , during which time he was the only person intrusted with my linnen and clothes , and when he gave up the account of them there was nothing at all missing . I must also observe , that I never saw a more civil or sober servant than he was , and he always behaved himself in such a manner that I should not imagine him to be capable of the matter he is now charged with . - Lewis . I live in Bond Street , and am a hosier and haberdasher . I have known the Prisoner about two years , and during that time his character and behaviour ( for what I know ) has been honest and just . A young gentleman at my house wanted a servant , I enquired after several , and among them the Prisoner came , and he hired him from the character he had of him at Sir Robert Rich 's , which was as good as any man could have ; and upon it he had the young gentleman 's place , where he behaved honestly and soberly . He was backward and forward at my house very often : he is a very sober man , I never saw him drunk in my life . Q. to Mr. Stanley . You say in about a fortnight 's time he went from you , did he go from you upon any misbehaviour ? - Stanley , Esq ; He went away from me because my servant was well again ; but if he had continued ill , or I had wanted another servant , I would have taken him preferable to any body I knew at that time . Jury . When they returned , did they come in company with this money , or did they come singly ? - Stanley , Esq ; They came in company . I do not know how far it may be proper to mention in evidence what my servant told me , who is absent ; for when they were upon the road they were not so much in company , but that if he had had a mind to have gone away with the money he might . Richard Pritchard . I belong to the Duke of Graston , I am one of his messengers . I have known the Prisoner twelve or fourteen years , he has been that time a gentleman 's servant , and always had the best of characters ; I believe he is a very innocent and honest man ; I never heard any ill of him till this time in my life . Q. to Wheeler . What had the Prisoner in his hand when he was taken ? Wheeler . It was a stick , and I think it was a little split at the end ; whether he threw it over the ditch , or no , I can not tell , but I could not said it . Acquitted . 249 . + George Wilson , of St. Andrew Holborn , was indicted for stealing a pair of pumps , value 9 s. the goods of John Holden , in his shop , April 28 . John Holden . I was at a publick-house and saw the Prisoner at my shop door . He looked back two or three times . I said there is a young man at my door who does not belong to any of my customers : I saw him take the pumps out of the shop , and took him two or three doors off with the pumps in his lap . Prisoner . The shoes lay at the door , and I knocked at the door , but nobody came , and so I went away with them . Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 250 . + Catharine Smith , of St. Mary le Strand , was indicted for stealing a gold watch with a gold seal , value 10 l. a linen handkerchief , value 1 s. 6 d. and five shillings in money , the property of Abraham Hoskins , privately from his person . April 20 . Abraham Hoskins . On the 20th of April as I was going through Eagle Court in the Strand , the Prisoner came up to me , and said , What have you got in your breeches ? I put my hand to my breeches , and found my watch was gone . I took the Prisoner into the Street , and then into the Swan tavern . I sent for the guards , and took her before a justice - I had my watch about a quarter of an hour before - I had not been in any company , I had been in the city . Prisoner . He had got two other women along with him , and he said I had got his watch , and had given it to another woman . Q . What time was this ? Hoskins . It was about nine o'clock in the evening . Q . Was it light or dark ? Hoskins . It was dark . Q . How did you know her then to be the person ? Hoskins . Because we took her into the tavern . Q . Was you sober then ? Hoskins . Yes . Q . It was an odd thing for a young gentleman to pick up a woman in the street , and was sober when you went about such a scandalous practice . Did not you charge two other women with it ? Hoskins . No . Q . You followed no other but she and one more , what became of the other ? Hoskins . There was a great mob about , and she got away . Q . Did you find any thing upon the Prisoner ? Hoskins . No . Q . Then how could you charge her with taking your watch when she had nothing upon her ? Hoskins . There was another woman came up to her , and I belive she gave it to her , for I missed it before the other woman came up . Q . How did she take it ? Hoskins . She wrenched my breeches open , and then I suppose she took it . I never let her go after I took her till I carried her before the justice , for I charged her with it directly - I was going through Eagle Court , it is a thorough-fare , I did not go into the court with her . Mr. Forrest . I was coming along , I saw a quarrel , and looked into the croud , and saw Mr. Hoskins holding a woman ( I think ) by the collar , I assisted him , we got her into the tavern , she stripped herself , but the watch was not found upon her . Q . Did Hoskins seem to be sober ? Forrest . He did . Mary Hobbins . I am servant to a fishwoman - I have seen the Prisoner come to my mistress 's habitation . I was coming with a jole of salmon , and saw a gentleman ( that last witness * ) with two women , and they both had their clothes up in the court ; so , says I , What do you go to play the rogue together , and they said get along you B - h , get along , and the woman pushed me down salmon and all . * Hobbins was mistaken , she did not know the Prosecutor from the witness , though they were very unlike . She delivered her evidence in a very odd manner , laughing most of the time . Q . You say you saw two women with the gentleman ? Hobbins . Yes ; and they had both of them their coats up . Q . What women were they ; was it the Prisoner ? Hobbins . No , not this woman , for I went after the women for the salmon , for I knew my mistress would make me pay for it ; so I said to the gentleman , you pushed me down , and the gentleman came up to the Prisoner , and said , you are one of the B - hes , and dragged her into the tavern . I stood a great while , and there came a great many soldiers , what became of the women afterwards I can not tell ; so , said my mistress , Do her all the service you can . - I am a Dutch woman . Q . Could you discern whether the gentleman was in liquor , you are upon your oath ? Hobbins . Upon my oath he was very much in liquor . Q . Was the Prisoner one of the women who was in company with the gentleman ? Hobbins . No , Sir . Q . Did he pursue the other two women ? Hobbins . He run after them , but he could not overtake them ; oh ! L - d G - d bless me , this is the gentleman [ she then happened to see the Prosecutor . ] Prisoner . He had a beggar woman before the justice . Hoskins . I had hold of another woman , I had two women in my hand once . Q . You swore positively that from that time you took the Prisoner , you did not let her go ? Hoskins . I did not let her go . Q. to Hobbins . Was it light or dark ? Hobbins . It was dark , it was between nine and ten o'clock . Jury to Forrest . Were Hoskins and you acquainted before ? Forrest . I never saw Mr. Hoskins before . Jury . I think you say he was sober . Forrest . He was . Hobbins . He was very much in liquor . Joanna Murray . I have known the Prisoner seven or eight years . I never heard any thing but that she had the character of a very honest woman - she is a married woman - I can not tell where her husband lives . Joanna Hanson . I serve her with bread , she kept the White Hart Inn in Hedge Lane - she is married to a shoemaker , her husband is a very honest man ; she washes for me now . Acquitted . 251 . + Ann Terry , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , in the County of Middlesex , single woman , was indicted for that she on the 24th of April , in the 17th year of his present Majesty , being big with a female child , on the said 24th day of April , & c. she the said Ann Terry , the said female child by the providence of God from her body did bring forth alive , which said female child being so brought forth alive , by the laws of this land is a bastard ; and that she the said Ann Terry , not having God before her eyes , & c. on the said 24th day of April , & c. after the said female bastard child was born , upon the said female bastard child being then alive in the peace of God , & c. feloniously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought , did make an assault , and the said female bastard child feloniously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought , in both her hands did take , and the said female bastard child with both her hands , out of a certain window in a lodging room belonging to the said Ann Terry three stories high , in a dwelling-house belonging to Esther Bird , Widow , in a place called Whetstone Park , into a paved yard , did cast and throw down , by which casting and throwing down into the said paved yard , she the said Ann Terry the said female bastard child several mortal wounds and bruises upon the head , back , belly , and sides , did give , of which said mortal wounds and bruises upon the head , back , belly , and sides , of the said female bastard child , the said female bastard child instantly died ; and therefore the Jurors do say , that she the said Ann Terry , the said female bastard child , feloniously , wilfully , and of her malice aforethought , did kill and murder , & c. She was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same murder . Mary Ditcher . On the 23d of April I happened to be abroad , and when I came home I was told the Prisoner was in a violent fit of the colic ; I said , Nanny , you being something in years may have some disorder . She had a Miss a little before Christmas . I sent her some penny-royal water , and when I came up again I saw some further disorder , but no appearance of the birth of a child . I asked her what ailed her . [ The witness expressed herself so as to show the nature of the Prisoner 's disorder . ] I sent for her aunt , and gave her that which was proper . In the morning the child was found in the yard . Her aunt came to me , and said , Mrs. Ditcher , Nanny has thrown it out . Said I , what has she thrown out ? Why , a child , said she . Said I , you frighten me to death . I said , oh Nanny ! how could you be so barbarous as to throw it out ? Said she , Mrs. Ditcher , I did it to hide my shame , and for fear you should see it . I asked her , whether the child was alive when it was born , and she said it was not . I did not see it till next morning . John Phillips . Between five and six the 24th of April in the morning as I was going to my work , I saw a dead child lye upon the pavement in the yard upon it 's back , so I went and alarmed the people of the house where the Prisoner lives - I live on the ground floor in the same house . Q . Did you make any observation upon the child ? Phillips . No more than to see that it was a child . Ann Tanner . On the 24th of April I was called to the Prisoner at the bar . I found she had been delivered of a child . [ She said she performed the business of a midwife . ] I asked her how she could do such a barbarous action as to throw her child out of the window ? She said she did it to hide her shame . Whether the child that was found was the child she was delivered of , I can not tell . Q . Did you see the child ? Tanner . Yes - it was a female child . Q . Did you observe whether the child was born alive or dead ? Tanner . I can not judge whether it was or not . Edward Kelleck . I was called by the Coroner in order to examine this child , and upon examination of the child , I found it in the first place entirely free from all cleansing , but naturally as it came from the body . Upon examination , after they had cleansed it , I found there was a large contusion on the left cheek by the Os Temporum , there was a confraction of that and the jaw bone . I opened the Thorax to make an experiment upon the lungs , and some part of the lungs would swim , and some would not : she tore it away I suppose from her body . I saw upon opening the lungs that part of them were a little inflated , and would swim ; this is a common experiment upon this subject , but by the tearing it away from her body , there was not time to inslate the lungs , and make them hollow . The child was blackish , which shows it was in a fluid slate while it was in the mother 's body ; but whether it had breathe or no after it came out of the body , I can not pretend to say . Q . What is your general observation in cases of this nature ? Kelleck . There is no role without an exception , sometimes , they may breathe before they come really into the world ; I have tried that experiment many a time , but I can not be downright certain and positive of it ; but if you take an infant out of a woman 's body ( before it breathes ) these lungs will never swim . Suppose a woman was six or seven months gone with child , and the child was dead within her , those lungs will never swim ; but as children come forward in the birth , they may breathe before they are really born . Q . If a child is still-born , and dies before the delivery , the lungs will never swim ; but if a child should die in the delivery , will they swim ? Kelleck . It is possible they may , but I believe she was so hasty in the birth , that I apprehend she did not give time to let it breathe . Q . If the child had any respiration , would not the whole lungs be inflated with the first respiration ? Kelleck . No ; there must be several respirations before the whole lungs come to be inflated . Q . Now as to the contraction or expansion of the lungs , I would ask you , whether , if the actual respiration from which the blood circulates is performed for three or four seconds , all the lungs are not expanded ? Kelleck . No ; I believe not in so short a space . Q . Now in the case of a still-born child , will part of the lungs swim , and part sink ? Kelleck . There have been experiments both ways . Q . Suppose a child is suffocated in the delivery , in that case does it occur to you , that part of those lungs have swam , and part have sunk ? Kelleck . Sometimes they have partly done so , and partly not , that is to say , if it was suffocated in the birth . Thomas Noakes . The prisoner is a very quiet honest woman , only very foolish . She used to close upper leathers for shoes ; she has worked for my father and me upwards of six years . Elizabeth Stendrup . I have known the Prisoner thirty seven or thirty eight years , I have reputed her a very silly foolish girl , not capable of taking care of herself . I never heard any ill of her , nor nobody can say any harm of her . I believe sometimes she is not compos mentis . Q . Do you think she is capable of knowing whether she is with child , or not ? Stendrup . I can not tell what to say to that ; I believe she might be so far non compos mentis as not to know the danger there might be attending the want of care . Elizabeth Eden . All I know of the Prisoner is , that she is a hard working body , and I never knew of any man that followed her . Q. Mrs. Ditcher , when you ordered her some pe royal water was she in her senses ? Ditcher . I can not tell ; as to the questions I asked her , she did not answer as if she had any sense . Q . Why so ? Ditcher . Because she said when she flung it out at the window it was to hide her shame ; and I asked her as to the other matters that belonged to the child , and she did not know what I meant . I asked her several questions afterwards , and she answered me as if she was delirious , particularly with relation to the manner of her delivery . And I asked her who was the father of it , she hammered a good while , and at last she said it was one that was apprentice to her brother . I saw the lad she laid the child to , the morning it was found , and he said he would have taken care of it , if he had known she had been with child by him . Guilty , Death . 252 , 253 , 254 , 255. James Haycraft , Ann Henley , otherwise Haycraft , Samuel Smytheman , and Elizabeth Eaton , of St. Margaret Westminster , were indicted for stealing a parcel of hardware , consisting of razors , pen-knives , buckles , buttons , & c. to the value of 30 s. the goods of William Griffiths , April 6 . Ann Griffiths . On the sixth of April I was called up at four o'clock in the morning , and found my shop broke open , and was robbed of the things mentioned in the indictment . I heard the Prisoners had given aw ay several things , upon which I got a search warrant , and had them taken up ; the men owned the breaking open the shop , that they were full two hours in it , and carried away the goods in a sack : the women owned that they stood watching , and that they were to give a sign if any body was coming by . Catharine Mcpherson . The men owned they were two hours in the shop , I did not hear the women say any thing . Thomas Rawlins . I had a search warrant directed to me from Justice Poulson , and I found all the goods mentioned in the indictment in Mr. Whiting 's show-glass , and Mrs. Griffiths said they were her goods . I heard James Haycrast say he was two hours in the shop , Smytheman said he was on the outside with the women . James Haycraft wanted to be admitted an evidence . Francis Whiting . I keep a shop in Holborn , and sell hard-ware , the women Prisoners came to me , and said they had some hard-ware to sell . I desired them to go to an alehouse , and told them I would come to them . I went , and they were all four together ; all of them had some of the goods , I bought them , and gave them 17 s. and 9 d. for them . Q . What may be the value of these goods ? Griffiths . I can not say exactly , I believe 30 s. if they were to be sold they would bring more . James Haycraft . On Friday the 6th of April about six o'clock in the morning , I called Smytheman up , and we went out a chimney sweeping , and got as much foot as we sold for sixteen pence , and coming home I kicked my foot against a trunk , and carried it home , and the next day we sold those goods to Whiting for 9 s. and 6 d. [ the other three Prisoners said they sold them to Whiting for 9 s. nad 6 d. ] Griffiths . They stole the trunk out of my shop , and owned before the Justice that they burnt it , in order to prevent a discovery . Mr. Perkins ( Justice Poulson 's clerk ) produced the examinations of Ann Haycroft , & c. taken in writing before Justice Poulson , April 12 , 1744. Ann Henley , otherwise Haycraft , says , that she was married at Town Malden in Kent to James Haycraft about three years since .

That they asked 20 s. for them , but the man bid them but 8 s. that one Francis Whiting bought them for 9 s. and 6 d. and told them , if they had any handkerchiefs to bring them to him on Monday , and he would buy them , for he was going into the country . The confession of James Haycraft , taken April 12 . 1744 . This examinate says , that on Friday last , Samuel Smytheman , Ann Haycraft , Elizabeth Eaton , and himself , broke open a shop belonging to William Griffiths , that Smytheman went in first , and that they put the goods into a sack , and brought them away between twelve and one o'clock , and that the two women kept upon the watch ; that the next day they went to Francis Whiting in Holborn , who went to a cellar by Gray's-Inn Gate , and that they sold them to him for 9 s. and 6 d. which money was divided between them share and share alike . The examination of Elizabeth Eaton . This examinate says , that she has been acquainted with Samuel Smytheman about a year and an half , and has lived with him as man and wife for six months past ; that he was an industrious fellow till within these four months , since which he has been acquainted with James Haycraft , who lives in Angel Court at Story 's Gate , Westminster , that they went to one Whiting in Holborn , who bought all the goods which were stole out of Mr. Griffiths 's shop , ( except a few pair of buckles which they kept themselves ) for 9 s. and 6 d. and no more , and that was divided between them share and share alike ; and that Whiting asked them if they had got any wipes [ meaning handkerchiefs ] and if they had , if they would come again on Wednesday he would buy them of them , and give them as much as any body would . Ann Henley , otherwise Haycraft , was acquitted , as being the wife of James Haycraft , and with him at the time the robbery was committed .

Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 257. Francis Shoeler , was indicted for stealing seventeen pound weight of glass , commonly called a composition of glass , value 3 l. the goods of Benjamin Bowles , April 13 . John Morse . I am clerk to Mr. Bowles , that fellow the ( Prisoner ) took seventeen pound of glass , which we call a composition of glass : there are ten colours in it . One Mr. Hakewell a jeweller in St. Martin 's le Grand came to my master , and told him some of his servants had robbed him ; for says he , there came into my hand seventeen pound of the same composition which I have had in my hand in your warehouse ; Mr. Hopkins in Aldersgate Street brought me the glass , and I am satisfied it is yours : let your clerk come to my house , and I will get a light into this affair . I went to Mr. Hakewell 's , he showed it me , and I was satisfied that it was our own : said he , if you will go to Duke 's Place I will show you the person that sold it . I went into Duke 's Place to Samuel Levi , a Jew , who sold it to Mr. Hopkins the jeweller ; and he went with me to enquire after the Prisoner , and Levi took him at an alehouse in Tower Street . [ There were several sorts of the composition produced ; ] that in the basket is what the Prisoner sold , and here is some of Mr. Bowles 's of the same number and colour . Q . How came you to suspect the Prisoner ? Morse . The Prisoner has had access to our warehouse , under pretence of buying wine glasses , which he used to get flowered round the edges , and when the warehouse keeper was gone into the soror , where the glasses are neiled , the Prisoner had an opportunity of taking this out of the baskets . Q . What is the use of this composition ? Morse . It is for the jewellers , it is for making pendants for the lady 's ears , and jewels for the kidies necks . He will tell you an idle story by and by how he came by it , but I believe that will be of no avail to him , for I am pretty sure no body makes this composition but Mr. Bowles . Q . Did he use to buy any of this composition ? Morse . No ; he bought nothing but drinking glasses . Prisoner . I have used his house ever since I came to England , I belong to the Queen of Hungary , I am of Prague in Germany . Samuel Levi . The Prisoner at the bar came to my house in Duke 's Place , and offered to sell me some composition of glass , I did not know the value of it , ( I believe that is the same sort of glass ) I told him I would go and enquire about it . I went and showed it to several people at the coffee-house , and nobody could tell what it was worth . I came back to him , and said I did not understand it ; and said , if you think sit to leave it with me , I will show it to some gentlemen , and the Prisoner left it with me upon commission to sell for him if I could . I carried it to Mr. Hopkins a jeweller in Aldersgate Street , the Prisoner told me I must ask 4 s. a pound for it , and I asked Mr. Hopkins that price ; he said that is too much , but if you will leave it with me , Mr. Levi , I will show it to a person who may buy it . I left it , and came to the Prisoner , and told him so , and that he must tell me the lowest price , and he told me I must take half a crown a pound , which was the lowest price , and Mr. Hopkins offered me half a crown a pound , and paid me two guineas : there was seventeen pound three ounces , and I brought the money to the Prisoner , and he gave me 3 s. and 6 d. for my trouble . Jury . Have not you seen large quantities of this glass in Mr. Hopkins 's Shop ? Levi . No ; I never saw any quantity of it in his shop , only the work that was made of it . Prisoner . I carried the glass to Mr. Levi to dispose of for me because I was a stranger to that sort , and left it with him for two days , and he brought me 2 s. a pound for it ; I told him I would rather have my glass again , and I said bring me the glass again , and he said there was no such thing as getting it again , for the gentleman would not part with it , so I was forced to take the 2 s. a pound for it , thought it cost me more . Q . How did you come by it ? Prisoner . I deal in glasses , I carry a basket about streets , I had it in exchange for some figured glasses , a pepper box , and several other things . I offered this glass to their warehouse-keeper to exchange for drinking glasses , and he would not take it . Q . Do you know any thing of this ? Morse . I have been told so , our warehouse-keeper told me the Prisoner had been with three or four small pieces to change for drinking glasses , and that he made him this answer ; our business is to sell this glass , we never take any again . Q . Do you sell it to any but jewellers ? Morse . Never to any but jewellers as I know of . Jury . Is there nobody that makes this composition of glass besides Mr. Bowles ? Morse . Not that I know of . John Brown , a Juryman Sworn . Q . Do you know any thing of any composition of glass of the same nature with this , which is sold by other people ? Brown . Yes ; there is Mr. Batailliard and another person , and there is an apothecary and surgeon by Moorfields who make this composition . Acquitted . 258 . + Lydia Booth , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing a black cloth coat , value 12 s. a waistcoat , value 12 s. a pair of breeches , value 2 s. a grey coat , value 6 s. and a cinnamon coloured coat , value 3 l. the goods of David Johnson , in the dwelling-house of Henry Coffin , April 19 .

And 261. Samuel Carpenter for receiving the same knowing them to be stolen , April 16 . John Abell . On the 16th of April I lost several pieces of beef and other meat out of my shop in Spittlefield 's Market , which are mentioned in the indictment , and a flank which I did not find . In the morning I found the door a jar , and missed two or three pieces of meat ; I looked further , and found that there was more gone . I went to one Abraham Lardent 's in the market , where I thought there were some loose persons lodged , and asked him what time such an one came in ; he said he came in at three o'clock in the morning . Mr. Lardent said , I will endeavour to find it out for you , we heard somebody was taken up , and we went to the Compter , and there was Thomas Dobbs ; I said , how could you serve me so as to take my meat away ? If you know any thing of it , said I , this is the only time to clear yourself : said I , who was concerned with you ? He said , there was one Isaac , I can not tell his other name , he goes by the name of Dumb Paw , [ he has a lame hand ] and Dobbs told me the meat was lodged at one Carpenter 's in Gravel Lane . I went to Carpenter 's house , and said , have you got any meat here ? Yes , he said he had ; said I , will you let me see it ? yes , he said , and welcome ; when he showed it me , said I , this is my meat . I asked him how he came to take it in , he said they told him they were going to Leadenhall Market with it . I asked him if he would let me have the favour of taking it away , he said yes , so I sent my son and another person and took the meat and sat away ; the meat was vastly tumbled , and looked like dogs meat , and there was some of the sat in a bag that belonged to Mr. Carpenter . After that I said he must go along with me , he said with all his heart . I had a constable behind me , and Carpenter went to the Compter along with the constable and me . Q . Did he tell you he knew that these people came dishonestly by it ? Abell . He said they came over night and gave him half a pint of gin to tell them about lodging the meat there . Abraham Millar . I was a constable for that night , there were two or three other constables with me , we went into several disorderly houses in order to get men for his Majesty , and by Stony Lane I met this Dobbs between one and two in the morning , he passed by us , and I did not take much notice of him , he seeming to be a boy : some time afterwards I saw him again , and then I asked him where he was going , he made no answer ; he had something under his arm , I asked what it was ; at first he made no answer , but the second time being asked what it was , he said what was that to us ; I told him we were officers of the night , and had power to lay hold of him unless he gave a good account of himself ; he made us no answer ; I looked into an old apron that he had , and there were two pieces of beef . I asked him how he came by it , he gave us no answer . I told him if he did not tell us how he came by it , he must go to the Compter , still he would not tell us his name , who he was , or where he had it ; and as my brother officer had him in hand he confessed he had broke open a shop in Spittlefield 's Market , ( he did not tell it to me . ) In the morning I had him before the Alderman at Guildhall , and then he confessed the whole fact - He confessed that he and Isaac , ( I can not tell his name , I think they call him Dumb Paw ) broke open the shop with a chopper , that they took down the moulding of the window , and then took a shutter down , and then he went in and handed the meat out to Isaac , and they carried it to this Carpenter 's house , and that they took two turns apiece , I believe it was the third time of his going that we took him . Abell . I heard him confess he had a chopper , and took down a shutter with it . Sarah Bond . I have known Dobbs eight or nine years , and know him to be an honest hopeful young lad - he carries meat up to Leadenhall , the Prosecutor does employ him . Abell . I never employed him in my life . Bond . Yes ; you have in watching of meat . Abell . I believe I have in that . Alice Pell . Dobbs has a very good character , I never knew him wrong any body in my life . I have sent him for money several times , and he has brought it very just and true . I have sent him for ten or twelve shillings , or a guinea at a time , this about three months ago . I have known him twelve years , he is a good honest boy . Jury . Are you a relation of his ? Pell . I am his sister . Goldburne and Carpenter acquitted , Dobbs guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation .

Bridget Berridge . I live in Denmark Street St. Giles 's , my servant had been sick , and left my service , and upon that account I went out of town on the Wednesday , and staid till Monday , when the other servant was to come . I keep but one servant , a maid servant . I came to town on Monday the 23d of April between five and six in the evening , and when I came to my house there was a constable and a great croud about it , and the constable told me the house had been robbed , and set on fire - I left the house safely locked up when I went out of town . Q . How did you find things when you went in ? Berridge . They were all scattered about the house . Q . Had your house been broke at all ? Berridge . I can not tell that .

These diamonds were delivered into my hands by the constable ; they were never out of my pocket . Samuel Urton . On the 23d of April about eight o'clock in the evening the Prisoner came to my shop in order to pledge this diamond buckle , he asked me 7 s. upon it , and I said I would lend him but 3 s. he stood very hard for 4 s. and I lent him 4 s. upon it , and I saw he was very full of money . Q . Did you know any thing of him before ? Urton . Yes ; the man does not live above thirty yards from my house , he came into the shop some days before , and was with my servant trying with a hammer whether some things were gold or not . I did not let him know that it was a diamond buckle , but he took it for a cypher buckle , an ordinary thing . I apprehended there was a robbery committed , and waited for a direction where to apply . ( I did not stop him then , for I knew where to find the man at any time ) - I live the corner of Crown Court , St. Ann 's , Soho , I am a pawnbroker . Mrs. Berridge . This diamond buckle I left in my house when I went out of town . Urton . On the Wednesday morning I saw an advertisement in the papers , and went to Mrs. Berridge directly , and got two warrants from Sir Thomas de Veil , one to search his house , and the other to take his person . Q . What is the Prisoner ? Urton . He is a labourer to the paviours , he had lived in the neighbourhood a year or two . After I had got the warrants , I sent my boy to watch when he came . As soon as he came home , my boy came and told me , and then we went to his house , and took him and his wife together , but by some means or other the wife slipped away , and we thought she was gone for a set of Irish to make a rescue . We searched the house , and I believe there was as much linen as was worth a hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds . Q . Where did you find this plate ? Urton . It was found hid about the bed , and some under the bed . I would not search before Mrs. Berridge came , and she owned these things as soon as she saw them . Prisoner . He has known me these three or four years , he never knew any harm of me . Urton . I have known him a good while , I never heard any such thing of him before ; he used to come and borrow a shilling or six pence now and then upon some ordinary things of his own . George Appleton . Mr. Urton brought a couple of warrants to me , we went to the Prisoner 's house , and Mr. Urton said , Mr. Connor , I want to speak to you , then he told him his business . I searched him , and found in his hand a silver snuff box , and in his pocket the box with the diamonds , and the watch chain ; there was another snuff box with three guineas in it , and I laid hold of a silver tankard . John Lloyd . I happened to be attending the parliament house at Westminster , Mr. Clarke came to me , and said , they were seeking after a man who had committed a very great robbery , and desired I would go with him ; I said I had no warrant ; Mr. Clarke said you may detain a thief without a warrant , and the other constable ( Appleton ) and I , and Mr. Urton , went and took the Prisoner . The other constable bid me search his pockets while he held him , I only searched to see whether he had any knife , pistol , or other weapon , and then the other constable pulled several things out of his pocket . Jonathan Thistletion . I went to the tavern to take half a pint of wine , and my kinsmen came to me , and told me that Mrs. Berridge 's house was on fire . ( this was last Monday was fortnight , April 23 . ) I went to the house , there was a constable , and a very great croud ; said I to the constable , what are you here for , break the door open ? I went first into the kitchen , there was no fire there , I came into the dining room and I was forced to go back the smell of fire was so strong . I went into the closet , then the fire began to burn , and the trunk was on fire . I clapped my hand upon it , and beat the fire in . Close to the wainscot they had placed this stool , [ the stool was produced , which had been stuffed , but the covering was burnt ; a trunk was also produced with a hole burnt through the lid about six or seven inches square , which Mrs. Berridge said was the trunk which she kept the plate in , ] close to the stool they had placed this trunk , and the waincoat began to slake ; the stool I slung out of the window , and I thought if there had been any thing in the trunk when I beat the fire in to have thrown that out of the window , but it was quite empty . They had so contrived it to set fire to these in the closet ( for the next house to it is a cabinet maker 's , and a slight wooden building ) that if it had been in the night we should have been all in flames . John Hunt . I was present at searching the house , and saw the plate found in the house that belongs to the Prisoner . Prisoner . That house did not belong to me . Hunt . Some of the plate was found in drawers , others were hid in the bedclothes and under the bed . I was informed that the Prisoner had taken another house just by , so after we had secured the plate we went and searched the new house , and in that house I found these keys [ there were some picklock keys produced ] and in that house I found a receipt for a South Sea annuity , which was given in the name of Berridge .

My partner took hold of the sack with one hand to help him up , and I took hold of it and helped him up with it . Q . When was this , how long ago ? Morson .

Richard Pidgeon . On the 30th of December last , a little after nine o'clock at night , I was going home from St. Catharine 's into Burr Street , where I live . Just as I came up by the King 's Brewhouse , I saw four men stand opposite to me on the other side of the way talking and laughing . When I had got about ten yards from them , I heard somebody come after me . One of them came up to me , catched me by the shoulder , and asked me , what ship I belonged to ; I answered , what was that to them . Another came on the right hand side of me , and said I must go to their officer . With that , my Lord , I told them , if they behaved like Gentlemen , and did not pull and hall me along . I would go with them . I had not walked above two or three steps before their officers ( as they called them ) came up to me , and one of them put a pistol to my mouth . and shoved me up against a palisado . When he had shoved me up against the rail , another came with another pistol , and they put one to each corner of my mouth , and said I must not speak , if I did they would shoot me . Then two of them came before me , and put their hands into my pockets , and I lost a guinea , a shilling , and some half pence . They asked me for my watch ; I told them , I did not carry a watch . There was a little girl came out , who took me for her father , and cried out , oh lah , oh lah , what do you do to my father ? I do n't know what I should have done if it had not been for the child : one of them put a pistol to the child , which put me under more concern than I was under for myself . Q . Did you know any of these people ? Pidgeon . When this Sherlock came up to me , I knew something of his face , but I can not positively swear to Sherlock . Q . Can you take upon you to say that the prisoner was one of the four ? Pidgeon . I can not positively swear to him . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Pidgeon . I believe he was one of the four . Q . Can you say from what you saw at that time that the Prisoner was one of the persons ? Pidgeon . He was in a different dress then , that I can not be certain ; they were very well dressed persons , and very nimble men . Francis Sherlock . On Friday the 30th of December , the Prisoner at the bar , Charles * Cleaver , and Walter Neagle being drinking at a publick house in St. John 's Square , the Prisoner at the bar and Cleaver sent Neagle to my house in Jerusalem Court , to tell me they wanted to speak with me . When I came they asked me if I had a mind to get a peny in an honest way . Said I , Do n't think I am a coward , I 'll go any where with you ; so we concluded to go to meet with the first Chance we could - all four of us ; we paid our reckoning , and went to a publick house in Bishopsgate Street , and there we had four pots of hot flip ; from thence we went to White Chapel road , expecting to meet some coaches coming up , but happened to meet none ( it was prodigious cold . ) Then we stepped into Stepney Fields , expecting to meet somebody there , and we saw a boy with a link at a distance , and somebody with him . Expecting a prize , we all run , and I fell down and made my nose bleed , but we found it was only a joiner 's boy with his hammer stuck in his apron . Then we concluded to go to the Round-about tavern in Wapping , to see if we could find any of the Captains of the Colliers , because it is used by them . We walked about for an hour , and met never a soul : then we went farther , and called at one Harry Inkester 's , where we had a rendezvous ; then we came up to St. Catharine 's , and by the King 's Brewhouse we met Capt . Pidgeon . * He was tried in February Sessions upon two indictments , one for robbing Mr. Pidgeon , and the other for robbing Mr. Abraham Constable , in company with Rocket , Neagle , and Sherlock ; and is now under sentence of Death . See Trials 174 , 155 . In the names of the London Jury in the first part , for Duporty read Duborty . Q . What did you do to him ? Sherlock . Neagle and the prisoner at the bar were standing at a Distiller 's shop , and Captain Pidgeon passed us ; the Prisoner and Walter Neagle stopped him and brought him to us ; Cleaver stepped a little nearer , I believe , and they robbed him of shilling and some halfpence : Neagle clapped a pistol to his mouth , to keep him from crying out - The Prisoner had the money ; I saw but a shilling and fivepence halfpeny . Q . Did he tell you who he took it from ? Sherlock . He could not tell the man 's name , he said he took it from the person he had stopped ; the prisoner came up to us with a great oath , and said , I have robbed him ; but he did not say at first what he took from him . Q . Had the Prisoner ever a pistol ? Sherlock . Upon my word , I can not tell ; for I do n't remember that we had above one pistol between us four ; there was but one pistol , and that Neagle had . Q . So he said he had got a shilling and fivepence halfpeny ? Sherlock . No , he said he had got some money ; and when we came to the night-house in Newgate Market , he said he had got a shilling and fivepence halfpeny . - It was about ten o'clock when we got there . Q . How do you know it was Capt . Pidgeon that you robbed ? Sherlock . I knew him in Holland , when he was Captain of a ship , and I was Mate of a merchant-man . Q . What time did you meet Capt . Pidgeon ? Sherlock . I believe it was a little after nine ; but it was almost ten when we came to the Night-house ; and we spent the money there . Prisoner . He said I shewed him a shilling and fivepence halfpeny , and then he said , they did not know what money I had got . Sherlock . I said , they did not know what money he had till he came to the night-house . Q . Did you see Sherlock there ? Pidgeon . I had some knowledge of him , but I knew him when I was sent for the Wednesday following by Justice Willoughby to the Tower Goal . Q . How came Mr. Willoughby to send for you to the Tower Goal ? Pidgeon . He sent for me to acquaint me that a person was taken up the night before , and denied me to come and see whether I knew him ; I went to the Tower Goal , and pitched upon him immediately , though I believe there were twenty people in the room . Q . Did you know him at the time that you was robbed ? Pidgeon . I knew him so well that I should remember him whenever I saw him again . Q . Where had you been then ? Pidgeon . I had been to see a Lady home not above 100 yards from the place where they robbed me , and was returning back again . Q . Then you can not say the Prisoner was one of them that robbed you ? Pidgeon . I would not say so for the world - I believe he was one of them - They were all genteelly dressed , with ruffles , like Gentlemen ; they were as well dressed as most people . Prisoner . I met Sherlock by Inkester 's door . Said he , How do you do ? I said I was glad to see him , and would drink with him , and I said . I design to go to sea to-morrow , so we went into Mr. Inkester 's , and I took my leave of him there ; that is all I know of the matter . Q. I think you say the first place you met the Prisoner at was in St. John 's Square , not at Inkester 's ? Sherlock . It was in St. John 's Square , and we went from thence to the Round-about tavern . Q . Where is Inkester 's house ? Sherlock . 'T is at the Golden Lion by Wapping New Stairs . Henry Inkester sworn . Q . Did you see the Prisoner on the 30th of December ? Inkester . I can not tell the day of the month , because I did not take any particular notice of it ; in a publick house we can not tell what day of the month people come in . Q . Did you see Sherlock and the Prisoner at your house in December after Christmas . Inkester . The Prisoner owed me a little money ; he was a Gentleman 's son , and had lodged at my house , and always paid me very honestly ; the latter end of December he came to my house and told me he was going to sea the next morning : I can not tell whether he went or not . Q . Was Sherlock there ? Inkester . Yes . Q . Did they come into your house together ? Inkester . Yes . Q . Did they go away together ? Inkester . Yes . I believe they did , I do n't take much notice of these things ; I leave such things to my wife and my servants - To the best of my knowledge they went away together . Q . When they were going from your house , did they seem as if they were going in company , or did they take leave of one another and part ? Inkester . I believe they went away together ; the Prisoner came to tell me he was going to sea ; there was nothing of value between us to signify much ; but it shewed an honest part , that he came to tell me he was going to sea . Q . Were there any more in company ? Inkester . Yes , I believe there were two more . Q . Do you know one Neagle ? Inkester . Upon my word , I do n't know the man , neither do I know that ever I saw him . Q . Do you know one Cleaver ? Inkester . Upon my word , there are a great many people come to our house that I do n't know . Q . Do you know two people that go by those names ? Inkester . I do not know them . Q . You say , there were two men in company , besides the Prisoner and Sherlock ? Inkester . They were in the room , I do n't know that they belonged to them . Q . Have you any thing more to say ? Inkester . That is what I have to say ; the Prisoner has lodged four or five years in my house , and paid me very honestly ; and I believe there is no body that knows any thing to his discredit , or to his dishonesty ; and I think it was the part of an honest man , to come to tell me he was going to sea . Q . Have you any thing more to say ? Inkester . I have something more to say ; his father is a merchant at Edinburgh ; he has drawn upon his father for money , and he has sent bills to me for 20 l. 10 l. and 7 l. and they have been always very well paid by merchants in London ; he was then Chief Mate of the Neptune , and was company for any Gentleman : I suppose you know Capt . Harris , who was one of the regulating Captains ; the Prisoner was his Chief Mate , and kept his rendezvous at my house , and lodged there . Prisoner . Sometimes I have had letters of credit from Edinburgh , and they were commonly sent to his house , and they were very honestly paid ; as to what Sherlock says , I know nothing of the matter . Jury . How was Sherlock dressed when he came that night ? Inkester . To the best of my knowledge , with a shag coat , and a waistcoat trimmed with silver Q . Did he usually go so ? Inkester . He used to go very well . Q . Had he any ruffles on ? Inkester . Upon my word I can not tell . Q. to Capt . Pidgeon . Did you see any of the persons that came upon you with a waistcoat trimmed with silver ? Pidgeon . I can not be positive to that , they were very handsomly dressed ; it was cold weather , and their coats were buttoned up . THE PRISONER 'S DEFENCE . James Sparkes . I have known the Prisoner six or seven years . Q . What character does he bear ? Sparkes . I think he deserves no character but an honest one , and I never saw any otherwise by him . I have used that rendezvous before and after ; I always paid my men at this Inkester 's house , on a Saturday night , and I never saw any thing by him but what was sober and modest ; he was not given to cursing and swearing , as some sailors are , and that made me take more notice of him ; if you have a mind to call any body to my character , you will judge whether I speak truth or no - I am an anchor Smith . Jane Inkester . I know the Prisoner very well . Q . Do you remember his coming to your house with Sherlock and two more in the month of December ? Inkester . Yes , very well . Q . What day of the month was it ? Inkester . I can not tell whether it was the 29th or 30th ; they came in brushing , as a great many gentlemen are apt to do ; there were some of the Sandwich gang there ; I told them , there was a press-gang in the house . Sherlock said , I do n't mind that , for I belong to a gang myself ; Sherlock threw open his coat , and there were two pistols and a hanger . When they were going , I asked who was to pay me ; and Sherlock said to my husband , D - n you , you owe me money . I wanted to know how that was . Said I , Does my husband owe you any money ? No , said Mr. Rockett , we owe him money . I went to see how the score was , and there was only two pots of beer ; when Sherlock was taken up , I said to him , I am sorry for you , I hope you have not brought Rockett into this scrape ; and Sherlock said , I am forced to do this to safe my life . Q . Did you see Sherlock at your house two days together ? Inkester . No - It was either the 29th or 30th of December ; it was one of the days . Jury to Henry Inkester . Did you see whether these people had any pistols ? Inkester . I ca n't tell any otherwise than my wife told me ? Q . Did your wife tell you of it before they went out of the house , or after they were gone ? Inkester . She told me Sherlock opened his coat , and that he had a couple of pistols , and I think a hanger by his side . Q . Did she tell you of it that night or afterwards ? Inkester . I believe it was before I went to bed ? Jury . I desire to know what time you go to bed . Inkester . That is an uncertainty . Q . What time o'night did they go from your house ? Inkester . To the best of my knowledge , it was between eight and nine o'clock . Jury . How far is your house from Burr Street ? Inkester . I live within two doors of Wapping New Stairs ; I do n't know how far it is . Jane Inkester . It is about a quarter of a mile . Guilty , Death . He was a second time indicted , for assaulting Mr Abraham Constable in an open place near the King 's highway , called Brewhouse Yard , in the parish of St. John Wapping , putting him in fear , and taking from him a pen-knife , value 6 d. a cork-skrew , value 1 d. and 10 s. in money , Jan. 3 . but as he was convicted upon the former indictment , he was not tried upon this . 274 . + Mary Shirley * , otherwise Catharine Davis , of All-hallows Honey Lane , was indicted for stealing two yards three quarters of striped cotton , value 5 s. 6 d. the goods of Matth.ew Wealy and John Rush , in their shop , April 23 . * She was tried in July Sessions in the Mayoralty of George Heathcote , Esq ; by the name of Mary Shirley , for stealing a remnant of linen in the shop of Thomas Setcole , and acquitted . Trial 21. p 6 . She was also tried in September Session , in the same Mayoralty , by the name of Catharine Davis , for stealing a piece of lace in the shop of William Coverley ( and convicted for transportation . ) Trial 89. p. 34 . The Prisoner begged the Court to give her what punishment they pleased , and not transport her ; for she would rather be hanged than transported again . Matthew Wealy . On the 23d of April the Prisoner came into my shop to buy two yards and an half of printed cotton ; we did not agree , and I did not sell her any ; there were several remnants upon the counter , which I had been shewing to a customer before . After she was gone out of the shop , Mr. Wiseham , a Linen Draper in the Poultry came and asked me if I had lost any thing out of the shop . I told him , I could not tell presently . He said , I believe you have had a shoplifter in your shop . After he was gone , I missed something . Mr. Wiseham came some time afterwards and brought me this remnant of printed cotton , which I had in the shop about a quarter of an hour before . I went directly to the Compter with Mr. Wiseham , and the Prisoner was there . Prisoner . Ask him how he knows he had it a quarter of an hour before ? Wealy . Because I had shewed it to another customer . Catharine Horabin . The Prisoner came into the Poultry Counter , to speak to C aptain Saunders . I was called to go with her into the back yard , and she dropped a bundle in the yard ; she took it up , and desired me to put it backward into the cupboard ( I do n't know what was in the bundle ) and I locked it up in the cupboard . Q . Who took it out of the cupboard ? Horabin . I do n't know , for my servant came to me for the key , and I gave it her . Thomas Wiseham . On Monday the 23d of April , about four or five in the afternoon , as I was standing at my door , a person came to me , and said , there 's one of the most notorious Shop-lifters in the Counter as ever was . Said I , I have lost a piece of calico this day , perhaps I may know the person . I went and looked at her , and she did not appear to be the person who was in my shop that day ; I went back to my shop , and the person who told me she was a shop-lifter , said , she is gone into the Wheat-sheaf in Cheapside . I said , if she is so good a hand , may be she may make something ; I went to that shop , and as I got there , she came out ; I went into the shop , and asked Mr. Wealy whether he had lost any thing , for I was told , the woman was a notorious shop-lifter , and had lately returned from transportation . He said , he did not miss any thing ; then I went to the Counter again afterwards , and the master of the Counter told me , if I would look into the cupboard , I might perhaps find my goods . The cupboard was opened , and I took this remnant of cotton out of the cupboard . I knew by the mark that it was Mr. Wealy 's ; so I went to him and asked him if he knew any thing of this , and he said , it is mine . Q . How had you the key of the cupboard ? Wiseham . The maid servant had the key , and she opened the cupboard - Her name is Hannah Smith . Q. to Catharine Horabin . Did you lock the cupboard door presently ? Horabin . I did not lock it immediately ; it was open some time , and the servant had the key , to take the liquors out ; I was out of the room several times - I keep the tap on the master side of the Counter . Q . Could not your servants come to that cupboard when they please ? Horabin . Yes , my servant may . - I have but one servant . Q to Wealy . Was not there another woman in the shop after the Prisoner ? Wealy . There was another woman in the shop after the Prisoner , but she went the other way ; the Prisoner went one way , and she went the other ; and if the other woman had gone the same way , she was not gone long enough to get to the Counter when Mr Wiseham brought me the cotton . Q How came you not to look over the goods as soon as the Prisoner went out of the shop ? Wealy . Because I had not time till the other woman was gone - She bought four yards of painted cotton . Guilty , 10 d. [ Transportation .

He was a second time indicted , for that he , after the first day of May 1734 , to wit , on the 24th day of February , in the 16th year , & c. with a certain gun , loaden with gun-powder and small stones , which he , the said Robert Fuller , then and there had and held in both his hands , in and upon one Francis Bailey , in the peace of God , & c. then and there being , unlawfully , maliciously , and feloniously , did make an assault , and that he , the said Robert Fuller , in a forcible and violent manner , unlawfully , wilfully , and feloniously did demand the money of the said Francis Bailey , with a felonious intent , the money of the said Francis , from his person , and against his will , then and there feloniously to steal , take , and carry away , against the peace , & c. and against the form of the statute , & c. Francis Bailey . On the 24th of February 1742 , I was coming from Uxbridge Market , and going home to a place called Harefield ; in my way home , I saw a man upon a stile , with a gun in his hand ; when I came up to him , he jumped off the stile , and took hold of my horse 's bridle , and clapped his gun against my body , and said , he would shoot me through the body . Upon that , I said , Do n't shoot me , for that will do you no good , nor me neither . He laid hold of my horse 's bridle again , and I put his hand away ; then he put his hand in my pocket , and I put the gun away from my body with my hand . Q . You say , he put his hand in your pocket ? Bailey . Yes ; he did three times . Q . What did you say to him ? Bailey . I said , friend , what do you mean , I am not willing to be robbed ? he then turned away from me . Q . What did you do then ? Bailey . I turned myself a little from him , then he turned himself round to see if the Uxbridge road was clear , and shot at me after I was going from him . Q . How far were you gone from him ? Bailey . About two pole I believe , not more , and I said to him , now you rogue , what good has this done you to shoot me , so he went to the stile from whence he came , and I saw no more of him , for my horse ran away with me , being frightened with the noise of the gun . Q . Did any of the shot of the gun touch you ? Bailey . I was shot into my right arm and out at my elbow , it shot the bone all to pieces , I have had abundance of stones and bones come out in an unaccountable manner , and I was near twenty weeks in a languishing condition with this wound . Q . Did the stones and bones come out of that wound ? Bailey . They came out of the very same place . Q . Did he take any money from you ? Bailey . He did not take any , he would have taken some , but I would not let him , for I put by his hand . Q . What did you say to him after he had shot you ? Bailey . I said , you rogue , what good has it done you to shoot me ? and then he went over the stile - I can not say he went over the stile , but I believe he did . Q . What time o'night was it ? Bailey . It was about seven o'clock , it was a clear star light night , I saw him three poles before he came to me . Q . Had you ever seen him before ? Bailey . Yes ; and I knew his father very well , the Prisoner lived then at Hillingdon End , and I believe he does now . Q . Had he any disguise over his face ? Bailey . No ; none at all that I saw . Q . Did you at any time observe any thing of his voice ? Bailey . No , Sir . Q . What were the words he said to you ? Bailey . He gave me no other words , but bid me stand and deliver my money , those were all the words that came from him . Q . Now you see the Prisoner , can you take upon you to swear that he is the man ? Bailey . That is the man , and nobody else - For the Prisoner . Here is a commitment of another * person for the same fact , and Bailey kept him seventeen weeks in prison , and never appeared against him at the goal delivery . * Thomas Bowry was committed for assaulting Francis Bailey with an intent to rob , and was continued in custody upon the affidavits of Mr. Mellish a surgeon , that Mr. Bailey was so ill of the wounds he had received , that he could not come to London without danger of his life , but he was discharged at the goal delivery in June Sessions , 1743 . Q . Did you ever swear this fact to any other person but the Prisoner at the bar ? Bailey . To no other person in any way , I never was the man that offered any such thing . Prisoner . There was another person committed on the oath of Francis Bailey . Bailey . It was not done by me . Prisoner . I never did any harm to him in my life . Bailey . You are the person that did me the mischief . A Witness . Bowry had got a bill and was cutting an elder tree , and he called to the Prisoner , and asked him , if he would have any leeks , he said he did not care if he had , and they went into a hogsty which was new built , and there was a gun , and Bowry asked the Prisoner what time he would go , and he said as soon as he had carried his leeks home , with that I went in doors and saw no more of them that night . Q . When was this ? Witness . It was the fourth of April - I am sure it was in April . Q . Where were they to go ? Witness . I can not tell where they were to go . Q . Was it a moon shiny night , or a dark night ? Witness . It was not a moon shiny night - this was about five o'clock .

Were you ever examined before any Justice of the Peace with relation to this fact ? Bailey . No . Q . Did you never charge this fact upon any body but the Prisoner ? Bailey . No ; upon no body else . - For the Prisoner . Here is a commitment before a Justice of the Peace charging this on Thomas Bowry . Bailey . I charged nothing upon Thomas Bowry . Q . Did not you swear to Thomas Bowry ? Bailey . Not any thing in this way of putting any man to Newgate . Q . Was not you before Mr. William Ashby ? Bailey . No ; I was not , for I was a dead man in a manner . Q . You know Mr. Ashby was with you ? Bailey . Yes ; he and several gentlemen more were with me in my afflictions . Q . When they were with you , did you charge Thomas Bowry with this fact ? Bailey . No ; it was not his face , so I could not swear to him ; I told them if they would give me the ladies of gold I would not swear it . Q . Did you know the Prisoner before this assault was made upon you ? Bailey . Yes ; and I knew his father and Fuller too ? Q . How came you not to give information of it at that time , that you might look out for the Prisoner ? Bailey . I was so bad I could not speak ; it was not Bowry that shot me , it was Fuller , and no body else . Q . Did you ever tell this to any body ? Bailey . Yes ; I did to several . Q . Did he ever abscond upon this account ? Bailey . He went away for twelve months , and I could not light of him . Francis Bowry . Fuller was in the town a week after Thomas Bowry was taken up . Jury . Where was Fuller found afterwards ? Bailey . He was found at his own home , but he went away three or four days after I received the damage , and never came to his family but by chance , as a rogue may do , who is afraid of being taken up . Q . When did you take him up ? Bailey . He was taken up the 27th of February 1743 , that is twelve months and three days after he did me the damage . Q . Did you tell your neighbours so when you came to speak ? Bailey . I told all my neighbours so - I told it to Esquire Ashby and Esquire Cooke . Q. to Francis Bowry . When was your son taken up ? Bowry . He was taken up the 8th of March was twelve months . Q . How long did the Prisoner continue visible in that neighbourhood after this affair happened ? Bowry . I believe he continued about a week . Q . Was he constantly in that neighbourhood , or only occasionally there ? Bowry . He was to the 21st of March at work with his master , a bricklayer , I can not tell where he went afterwards . Q . Did you see him again till such time he was taken up upon this charge ? Bowry . To the best of my knowledge I did not . George Cooke , Esq ; sworn . Q . Do you know any thing of the account Bailey gave of this immediately after it had happened ? George Cooke , Esq ; This made a great noise in the country , and a gentleman , ( I think it was a surgeon ) , came and told me he believed Bailey could not live till next morning , and desired as I was in the commission of the peace that I would go and take what evidence he was capable of giving . I went to him , and asked him as to the circumstances of the fact , and he said much the same as he has said now ; I asked him who it was that did it . He said , he did not care to say who it was . I asked him whether it was Bowry : He said it was not him , as he said with respect to two or three other names that I mentioned . I asked him whether he would swear to any thing ; he did not care to do it ( he was in a very weak condition ) but he said , if he lived to come abroad again , and was to see the man , he should know him as well as any man in England ; I believe he was a little conscientious , as he thought himself a dying man , and so did not care to swear to any body . [ The Prisoner desired some witnesses might be called to his character . ] Joseph Judge . I know the Prisoner to be an honest pains taking man , and one that takes care of his family - I knew him when he sucked at his mother 's breasts , and I take him to be a very honest worthy man . Jury . Are you any relation to him ? Judge . I married his mother 's sister 's daughter . Jury . We should be glad to know when he absconded where he went , and to have some account of his behaviour during that time . Judge . I did not know where he was . Francis Bowry . He is a good honest man , he serves the Bricklayers , and works hard for his living and to maintain his family . Jury . We beg Mr. Cooke will be so kind as to speak to the character both of the Prosecutor and the Prisoner . George Cooke , Esq ; As to the character of the Prosecutor , I do n't think the man would take a false oath upon any account in the world . ( I have lived all my life in the parish , and he always bore an extraordinary good character . ) I have very good reason to believe so , because he was so cautious ( when I was with him ) what he said . Q . What is the character of the Prisoner ? George Cooke , Esq ; I do n't know whether it may be so proper in a Justice of Peace , as 't is a case of life and death , to say any thing , and therefore I desire to be excused . Mr. Jabez Goulder sworn . Q . What is the general character of the Prisoner ? Mr. Goulder . From my own knowledge , I know no harm of him , but his general character is not the best . Q . What is the character of the Prosecutor ? Mr. Goulder . He is a man of as good a character as any in the country . I never heard any thing amiss of him in my life . Guilty of shooting at Francis Bailey , Death . And guilty of assaulting him with an intent to rob . The Jury , on account of a circumstance in this trial , relating to the commitment of Bowry , on the oath of Francis Bailey , recommended him to the Court as an object of his majesty 's mercy . 276 . + Jane Tease , wife of Peter Tease , was indicted , for that she , after the 24th day of June 1736 * , to wit on the 23d day of June in the 16th year of our Sovereign Lord George II . now King of Great Britain , & c. with force and arms , that is to say , at the parish of St. Bennet Paul 's Warf , in the ward of Castle Baynard , falsely and feloniously did utter and publish as true a certain false and counterfeit paper writing , or instrument , partly printed and partly written , sealed , purporting to be the last will and testament of Richard Clarke , and to have been signed , sealed , published and declared by the said Richard Clarke , as and for his last will and testament , which said paper writing , or instrument , partly printed and partly written , is in the words and abbreviations of words following , that is to say : * This was made a capital offence by an act of parliament made in the year 1736. `` In the name of God , Amen .

There was 18 l. 5 s. 7 d. due , neat wages , after the Chest at Chatham and Greenwich Hospital are deducted . Francis Sherlock sworn . Q . Do you know the Prisoner at the bar ? Sherlock . Yes , very well . Q . How long have you known her ? Sherlock . About three years - She is the wife of Peter Tease a Gardner at Covent Garden Market . Q . Do you know any thing of a pretended will of Richard Clarke 's ? Sherlock . Yes , I can tell you the particulars of it without seeing the will . Lewis Morgan . I had this will from the Bishop of London 's Office in Doctor 's Commons ; this is purporting to be the last will and testament of Richard Clarke . Q . Is not the name of the supposed testator there ? Sherlock . Yes , the name is Richard Clarke . Q . Who wrote it ? Sherlock . I did ; I wrote the name of Richard Clarke . Q . What did you do it for ? Sherlock . I did it to receive the wages that was due to Richard Clarke . One James Higgins signed the name of Cockerell . Q . Had you any discourse with the Prisoner about this ? Sherlock . On the 21st or the 22d of June 1742 , the Prisoner came to my lodging , and asked me if I had any business for her to do - She knew the business - Forging and publishing seamen 's wills . ( There was one Tom Lion , who came home in the Garland man of war , as an invalid , told me that such an one was dead . ) I bid her call in the morning ; she did so ; and I went with her almost to Mr. Alexander 's , the Proctor ; I saw her and Mr. Alexander go to Doctors Commons , and I went into the Bell Inn . In about half an hour 's time she came and said she had done the business . I gave her some money to pay for the will , which I think was six or seven shillings . Ann Brogden went along with her to bear her company , and she said , she had like to have lost it . She went to Mr. Purvis for the ticket , and he asked her name . She said , Jane ; but Ann Brogden gave her a push , and said , Your name is Alice ; but she got the ticket . I did not want money then , so I kept it a few days . I happened to be arrested , and I sent for her to personate the wife of Richard Clarke ; and one Ewin , who keeps the Whittington and Cat at Bell Dock , who I owed some money to , went to Mr. Jasper 's and found it to be a true ticket . I saw her make that mark ; 't is wrote , the mark of Alice Clarke ; the clerk who was sent for filled it up in the spunging house , and she told him her name was Alice Clarke ; five or six people more heard her , who can be called upon occasion . Then I was released , and had a note from Ewin for the remainder of the money - I believe the ticket came to 17 , 18 , or 19 l. or thereabout ; it was sold to Mr. Coward , who is Clerk to Mr. Henshaw on Tower Hill . Q . Who received the money at the Pay-Office ? Sherlock . I do n't know ; I received four or five or six guineas of Mr. Ewin upon the balance , and I gave her two guineas out of it . Charles Alexander . I proved this will before Dr. Kynaston . She was sworn before him as the executrix of Richard Clarke - Alice Clarke is the executrix . Q . Who saw her sign that ? Sherlock . Robert Collins , the officer that arrested me . The will was produced and read . George Purvis . This ticket was made out for the payment of Richard Clarke 's wages ; it was delivered the 30th of January 1742 , to the widow Alice executrix . Q . Do you know the Prisoner ? Purvis . I remember I have seen her at the Pay Office , but I can not remember her as to this particular thing . James Coward . I am clerk to Mr. Henshaw on Tower Hill , I applied to the Treasury Office to receive this money , and did receive 18 l. 5 s. 6 d. Prisoner . I know nothing of the affair , I am innocent of it upon my word . Tamar Topp . The Prisoner has been my lodger about a year and a quarter ; she takes in washing ; she was always reported to be an honest woman . The Prisoner kept Mr. Sherlock 's wife in a lying in - Mr. Sherlock and a great many more used to come to her room , but I did not know what they came for , but I thought they were not as they ought to be . Q . What did you take them to be ? Topp . I thought they could get money when they had a mind to it . I know nothing of them , but this poor woman is brought into a scrape , and I must needs say I could not think the woman to be guilty of any such thing , perhaps Sherlock might send her of an errand , and give her a shilling for it , because she did not know what she went about . Q . Did you ever hear of their forging of seamens wills ? Topp . Never before she was taken up , I did not think she would wrong any body . Q . Was she ever at Portsmouth ? Topp . She never was gone long enough to go to Portsmouth , only the time she nursed Mrs. Sherlock 's child . Susan Smith . I have known the Prisoner about six years , and always took her to be an honest hard working woman - I never saw Sherlock before but once , and that was when she had a child of his to nurse , and he came to see the child about six weeks before he was taken up . The Prisoner had four small children at that time to take care of . Acquitted . 277 . + Sarah Lowther , late of London , Spinster , otherwise Sarah the wife of Robert Rochead * , was indicted for that she after the 24th of June , 1736 , to wit , on the 18th of November , in the 17th year of his now Majesty 's reign , at the Parish of St. Bennets Paul 's Wharf , & c. did falsely and feloniously utter and publish as true , a certain false and counterfeited paper writing or instrument , partly printed , and partly written , sealed , purporting to be the last will and testament of Nicholas Wollin , deceased , and to have been signed , sealed , published , and declared by the said Nicholas Wollin as and for his last will and testament , & c. `` In `` the name of God , Amen . I Nicholas Wollin , `` Mariner , now belonging to his Majesty 's ship the `` Deptford , being of found and disposing mind `` and memory , hereby make this my last will `` and testament . First and principally I commend `` my soul , & c.

In witness whereof `` I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 28th `` day of December , in the year of our Lord 1738 , `` and in the 11th year , & c.

She was also indicted for falsely and feloniously uttering and publishing the same knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited , against . & c , Edward Bentham sworn . Q . Look into the muster book of the Garland * man of war , and see when Nicholas Wollin died , and what wages was due to him ? * He was removed from the Deptford to the Garland . Bentham . He died the 26th of April , 1742 , at sea , and there was due to him for wages 42 l. 16 s. 5 d. James Aickin . I was at Sarah Lowther 's [ the Prisoner ] lodging the 18th of November , 1743 , and saw Robert Rochead deliver to her a false will of Nicholas Wollin 's : he wrote the man 's mark and one of the witness 's names , and I wrote the other witness 's name , and filled up the body of it as Sherlock directed me . Q . Was the Prisoner present then ? Aickin . She did not say any thing till we delivered her the will , which was as soon as it was dry . This is the very will that I saw Sherlock put this mark to , and sign George Gordon the witness . There came in one Ann Broyden , and Brodgen said she could be of service to her , and she would go and recommend her to Mr. Major the proctor - I did not go in with them , I saw them go in , and I saw them come out , and she said she had administred , and that Mr. Major was a very pretty sort of a man , and had given her a dram . She did not get the probate then , she went two days afterwards , and I went into the Paul 's Head while she was at Mr. Major 's . I went to her lodging again , and she said she talked with Mr. Major , and pleaded a great deal of innocence ; that she was an innocent girl , just come to town . But the probate was not ready the second time , and she said she had administred again , because she had administred at first to under twenty pound , and the wages being more she could not get a ticket . The first administration was on the 18th of November , the other on the 28th of November , and she did not go again till the 5th of December , and then she said she had been at the Ticket Office , but was bamboozled out of the money by a roguish proctor , for one Mary Horsema had received the money the 25th of November , and Robert Rochead had abused her prodigiously about it ; and she desired me to ask Mr. Major , whether there was ever another will and probate granted , and Mr. Major said there was no will entered , either in the Prerogative Court , or the Bishop of London 's Court ; and Mr. Major said she had used him very ill after she had received the money not to come and pay him . Q . Are the Prisoner and Rochead married ? Aickin . I believe he is not her husband , for I was with her at her landlord 's in Shoe Lane , and she paid him some money , and she wrote a receipt in the name of Rochead , and she made him write another in the name of Sarah Lowther - she went by the name of Rochead . Q . Did they pass for man and wife among you ? Aickin . No ; for I knew he had got another wife at Deptford . The will being proved to have been taken out of the Bishop of London 's office at Doctor 's Commons , was read in evidence . It was proved that Sarah Wollin [ the Prisoner ] was sworn before Dr. Chapman , that Nicholas Wollin was dead , and that the effects did not amount to twenty pound . Henry Major sworn . Q . Do you remember the Prisoner being with you upon any occasion ? Major . I do remember the Prisoner very well , I am certain to her . On the 18th of November last she came to my office with a woman , who went by the name of Frail , and who had proved a will three days before . She said she had brought another woman whose husband was dead in the same ship that hers died in , and the Prisoner produced this will , and I wrote what we call the jurat upon it , and she was sworn before Dr. Chapman . She said she apprehended the effects did not amount to twenty pound , and I think she obtained a probate for six shillings , because the fees when the effects are under twenty pound are very low in the office . She had a bruise on one of her eyes , and she accounted for it in this manner : that she was lately come from Worcester , and by the waggon being turned over she had got that bruise . I told her I had lately been at Worcester , and that it was my mother country , and upon that we had some discourse . I told her as she was a stranger in town my clerk should go with her to the office , and I believe I sent my clerk with her , and the wages due were 42 l. 16 s. 5 d. and she did obtain the second probate on the 28th of November , 1743 , before Dr. Chapman , and then the former probate was brought in and declared null and void , and she was resworn as the widow of this man , and sole executrix . She said she had not money for the second probate , by my bill there is due to me 2 l. 12 s. The last time I saw her at my office , she said she could not get the money , it being paid to another person . When I take a probate out in the Bishop of London 's office , I enter it in the Prerogative to prevent a forged will being brought in . Q . How come the money to be paid to another person ? Major . There was a probate granted in some inferior court , either at Deptford or Greenwich , & c. but not at Doctor 's Commons . Daniel King . I am clerk to Mr. Major . Q . Did you ever go with the Prisoner to the Navy Office in order to receive a ticket upon the 18th of November last ? King . The Prisoner came with a will , which she said was the will of Nicholas Wollin , who was boatswain 's mate of his Majesty 's ship the Garland , and said that she was his widow and sole executrix , and desired Mr. Major to prepare a probate for her . He wrote the probate , and got her sworn ; and she telling him a story of her coming from Worcester , that she was overturned in the waggon , very much bruised , and forced to lye by a month , and not knowing the town , Mr. Major desired I would go to the Navy Office with her . She had at first sworn that the effects were under twenty pound , and when I came to the office I was informed there were upwards of forty pound , and they would not pay it upon that probate , so I was obliged to get another probate . When that probate was made out which was the 28th of Nov . I went again to the office , and after a great deal of trouble in going several times to the Pay Office and Navy Office , at last I found by Mr. Turner that the money was paid to one Mary Horsemare , who was the executrix of a will . Prisoner . I was married to Nicholas Wollin , and was afterwards married to Rochead . Mary Hall . I knew the Prisoner in her first husband 's time ; his name was Wollidge , I always called him so . My husband and I lodged in her husband 's house in Goodman 's Fields between three and four years ago ; he was a Dry Cooper , and worked some where by the Tower - I have not seen him these three years . - I never knew him of any other trade but a Cooper . - I never knew his Christian name - She never went by any other name but Wollidge or Rochead . Q . How long has she gone by the name of Rochead ? Hall . About two years . - He is a seafaring man , a hardy looking sort of a man . Esther Rawlinson . I have known the Prisoner these two or three years ; I have washed for her and this husband . Q . What is her husband 's name ? Rawlinson . His name is Rochead ? Q . Do you know her former husband 's name ? Rawlinson . His name was Wollin or Flannel , or some such name . Q . How long has she been married to Rochead ? Rawlinson . About two or three years ( but I call her Wollin frequently before her husband . ) I can not be certain how long she has been married ; for I have a very bad memory - I do n't know what business her husband was of ; I never was much within the house only as to speaking or drinking , with her - I did live in the New Street in Goodman 's Fields , and she lived in Ashffe Street ; I had now in Cobb 's Court in Black Friers , and have these two years . Q . Do you know Mary Hall ? Rawlinson . I have known her seven or eight years , or better ; she lived with the Prisoner when she kept house . Q . Had you any acquaintance with the Prisoner ? Rawlinson . No farther than drinking with her . Q . What once or twice ? Rawlinson . I have seen her more than a dozen times , and have drank with her . Q . Now as you were so little acquainted with her , how came the name of Wollin so much in your mouth , that you can not think of the name of Rochead ? Rawlinson . I hope your Honour will excuse me ; I am not used to such a place as this , it frightens me . Mary Hall . I have known Rawlinson these eight years ; she used to drink with the Prisoner sometimes , through my knowing of her . Joseph Haughton . I live in King 's Head Court in Shoe Lane - I am a Fanstick Maker . [ A person in the Court said , that this Witness is a Ballad Singer . ] Haughton . I can not say I never did sing . Q . How long ago is it since ? Haughton . About half a year . Q. Ha n't you done it within this week ? Haughton . No indeed ha n't I - I only know the Prisoner by living in the place with her about three months ; I do n't know any harm or any good of her . Council for the Prosecution . Mary Hall says , the Prisoner 's husband was called by the name of Wollidge , and that she knew him about three years ago ; and it will appear by the books of the office , that this person has been in the sea-service ever since the year 1738 ; he was indeed a Dry Cooper too , but he was Boatswain 's Mate , which shows he must be a good sailor . Edward Bentham . He was on board the 1st of January 1738 , and was rated an able sailor , and was so till the 9th of October , 1741 , and then he was made Boatswain 's Mate ; and it appears he was in that ship till the time of his death . Guilty , Death . Sarah Lowther pleaded her belly , and a Jury of Matrons being impanelled , she was found with quick child . 278 . + Mary Cooke , the wife of John Cooke , was indicted for that she after the 24th day of June . 1736 , to wit , on the 8th day of March , in the 16th year of his now Majesty 's reign , at the Parish of St. Bennet Paul 's Wharf , falsely and felonionsly did utter and publish as true , a certain false , forged , and counterfeited paper writing , & c. purporting to be the last will and testament of Donald Mcdonald , wherein are the following words , & c. `` I Donald Mcdonald of the `` parish of St. Giles 's in the Fields , mariner , & c. `` do give and bequeath unto my beloved wife `` Margaret Mcdonald , all such wages , prize money , `` short allowance , & c. as shall become due `` to me on board any of his Majesty 's ships of `` war ; and I do hereby nominate , constitute , and `` appoint the said Margaret Mcdonald executrix of `` this my last will and testament : And I do give `` and bequeath to my said executrix , all the rest `` and residue of my estate whatsoever , both real `` and personal , hereby revoking and making void `` all other and former wills by me heretofore `` made , and I do declare this to be my last will `` and testament . In witness whereof I have here-unto `` set my hand and seal this 10th day of `` May , 1738 , and in the 11th year of the reign , `` & c. his `` Donald [ ] Mcdonald . mark. `` Signed , sealed , published , `` and declared , & c. in the `` presence of us , & c. `` James Gordon , `` William Carelton . '' With intent to defraud our said Lord the King , against the form of the statute , and against the peace , & c. She was also indicted for uttering and publishing the same knowing it to be false , forged , and counterfeited . Edward Bentham . Donald Mcdonald belonged to his Majesty 's ship the Garland ; he is marked to have died October 17 , 1741. the wages due to him was 30 l. 9 s. 11 d. James Aickin . The 6th or 7th of March , 1742-3 , Francis Sherlock and I forged the will of Donald Mcdonald , Sherlock and I went to the Prisoner 's house . He told her he had forged a will , and I asked her whether she would go to the Commons with it , and she went with Sherlock to the Commons , and on or about the 9th of March I saw her pay for the probate to a little boy in the office of Mr. Alexander the proctor . I read the probate , and returned it to her again : she went to the Ticket Office , and I saw her deliver the administration into the hand of Mr. Bentham . I heard him ask her what countryman her husband was , and she said a Scotsman ; upon which Mr. Bentham said you look like an honest woman , and he gave her a ticket for the wages due to Donald Mcdonald , a mariner , on board his Majesty 's ship the Garland . I went with her to Mr. Parr 's in Poor Jowry Lane , she told him she wanted to dispose of her husband 's ticket , but when he came to ask her how long he had been out , she could not make him any direct answer ; and he said , woman , I believe you did not come honestly by it ; she was frightened , and said , she was afraid we should both have been stopped . We went to Mr. Henshaw 's and Mr. Jasper 's , and they would not meddle with it : then I went to James Gulliland a slopseller in East-Smithfield , and he promised to get it sold . We went to the Woolpack in Birchin Lane , and Gulliland came to us , and said , the ticket was sold : we went to the King 's Arms Tavern in Lombard Street , where Sherlock and she waited , and Sherlock gave her two guineas , and she was angry , and said , she would never do such a thing again , and Sherlock pulled out thirteen or fourteen guineas , and said , that was all the rogue Gulliland had given him , and that he had stopped seven shillings besides , and he gave me two guineas and an half , Francis Sherlock . Aickin and I forged the will of Donald Mcdonald ; the Prisoner had been at Chatham with me about forging the will of one Michael Hannon , but that would not do , for the man was alive . I told her , as she had missed then , I believed I had one that would do - I told her I had a will that I had forged , and if she would prove it I would satisfy her for her trouble . Council for the Prisoner . Were you to satisfy her for her risque . Sherlock . No ; she was to run the risque herself . I showed her to Mr. Alexander 's door , and she went and proved the will . I went home , and sent Aickin and the Prisoner to Mr. Parr 's in Crutched Friers , but they could not dispose of it there . He asked her some questions , and she said three ways two years : he asked her how long her husband had been on board , and she said two years : he asked how long he had been dead , and she said two years ; and she said two years to another question : he said he believed she did not come honestly by it . Then I went to Gulliland in St. Catharine 's , and he could not get it sold directly ; Gulliland , Aickin , and I , went to the Ticket Office , and had it cast up - it was about 30 l. Some time afterwards Gulliland , the Prisoner , and I , went to a notary publick not a great way off , and who should come in while we were there but Mr. Tarver a merchant , and the bill of sale was made over to Mr. Tarver , ( Aickin waited at the Woolpack in Birchin Lane . ) After it was filled up , Mr. Tarver asked her to write her name , and she said she could not write , but she would set her mark ; and Mr. Tarver said it is no matter whether you can write or no , for your mark will hang you as well as your hand writing . Gulliland , the Prisoner , and I , went into the Woolpack , Gulliland had a 20 l. note of Alderman Hankey 's , which was payable to Mr. Tarver , and Gulliland brought the money ; it was part in Portugal gold , and part in guineas ; then Gulliland , the Prisoner , and I , went to the King 's Arms Tavern in Lombard Street , and there he gave me the money , I think it was 15 l. or 16 l. - He said he knew the name as well as I , and that he had as much right to it as I , and he had three or four pound gratis besides 3 s. 6 d. in the pound , which he kept for the discount of the ticket ; and I was not willing to make words about it , because I knew how it was , and the last day of January I put all of them in my information voluntarily before any body else , - I gave the Prisoner two guineas for her trouble , and I gave Aickin two guineas and a half ; the Prisoner grumbled , and thought she had not enough , and I told her I would satisfy her , and I believe I gave her some silver to buy some fish . Prisoner . Oh you wicked rogue to draw so many poor innocent people in ! Sherlock . You drew yourselves in , as well as I drew you in ; I think I did very well to bring you all to justice , or else you would have brought me to it , I only catched you first . She has been with me several times since to ask me if I had any more business for her to do . Prisoner . Oh that vile man ! [ The will was produced and proved by Lewis Morgan to be the original will that was deposited in the office . ] Sherlock . Aickin signed the name of James Gordon , and I signed the name of William Curelton , and I believe I made the mark of Mcdonald Aickin . I wrote James Gordon , and Sherlock wrote William Curelton . Charles Alexander . There was a person came to prove this will , but I can not say who it was , I can not say it was the Prisoner . Francis Cuxon . This will was proved by one who stiled herself by the name of Mcdonald - I do not remember the Prisoner 's coming to prove this will , but I remember her coming afterwards with another woman to prove a pretended will of another person 's . [ The will was read . ] The jurat. `` Margaret Mcdonald , the sole executrix named `` in the within written will , was sworn before `` me , that the effects were under 20 l. and that `` he died in his Majesty 's service. `` Robert Chapman , surrogate. `` March 8 , 1742. `` F. Cuxon , `` For my master C . Alexander . '' Edward Bentham . The money was paid to Thomas Parr , as for Margaret the executrix , and I have marked this probate , as the probate for which I delivered out the ticket . Q . How came you to pay this , when the probate was under twenty pound ? Bentham . The wages were not cast up , if they had I would not have given the ticket ; we commonly do cast them up unless we are in a hurry . Prisoner . I never did any such thing in my life , and I never will again . Robert Brewer and Mary Clement gave her the character of an honest hard working woman . Q. to Clement . Did you ever see Aickin or Sherlock at her lodgings ? Clement . She said she was to go and fetch Sherlock 's child to nurse - about eight or nine months ago . Q. to Cuxon . Do you recollect that you ever saw the Prisoner at the bar , unless it was at that time that she came with the woman about proving the other pretended will ? Cuxon . No ; never before - it is about six months ago . William Tarver sworn . Jury . Is this the woman that assigned this ticket to you ? Tarver . I verily believe she is not , I gave Gulliland a draught upon Sir Joseph Hankey for 20 l. and some money besides . I do remember something of Sherlock , but I can not say I remember any thing of the Prisoner ; I think the woman , according to my notion , was a fine jolly woman - I dare say that is not the woman . Sherlock . That was another woman Mr. Tarver . Council . Did you say any thing that your mark will hang you as well as your hand writing ? Tarver . I do not remember any thing of that ; I do think the woman had set her mark , and that every thing was done before I came in to the notary publick . Acquitted . 279. Mary Bond , was indicted for stealing a silver value 15 s. the goods of John Milbourne , Esq : April 9 . 280 . And Rebecca Calverack for receiving the same knowing it to be stolen , April 9. John Milbourne . About the 9th of April my wife missed a silver salt , and was told that a couple of girls had been at my house to sell something ; I knew where to find the children . Bond confessed that she stole the salt , and gave it to the other girl , and she pawned it . I went to the pawnbrokers , and Mrs. Hatton said it was pawned to her by Rebecca Calverack . Mary Hatton . Mrs. Calverack brought this salt to me , and I lent her 12 s. on it . I asked her whose it was , she said it was Mrs. Ellis 's , and Polly desired me to take care of it , for she did not know how soon it might be called for : said she to my daughter , miss Polly write No . 12 upon it , for as I am big with child , I dont know whether I may be able to come for it ; and I desire you will deliver it to any person I send for it . Capt . Milbourne . This is my salt , I know it by several marks . Calverack . Ask Mrs. Hatton whether she has not known me a great many Years , and whether she ever knew any ill of me ? Hatton . I never did , she always bore a good Character . Calverack . Bond is my Apprentice , the child brought me the salt , said she , mistress , I have found something ; I think 't is a sort of a cistern , I said , I desire to know the truth , if you came dishonestly by it , tell me so , and I will send it home : and she said , she did not come dishonestly by it , but had found it . Q. I ask you whether the Girl did not say before the Justice that she found it ? Hatton . She did ; she said she found it in the street in an old handkerchief , and the Justice said what handkerchief , and the Girl said it was in her mistress 's Pocket , and Mrs. Calverack pulled out a dirty rag of a handkerchief , and the child said she found it in that . Acquitted . 281 . + , was indicted for stealing 50 pieces of ancient English gold coin of the value of 25 l. the goods of , Esq ; in his dwelling house , March 30 . Taylor White . I went out of Town the 1st of March to go the midland circuit , and lost these coins which I have in my hand , and for which the prisoner stands indicted , locked up in a cabinet together , with a great many other old English Coins . In my absence , I was informed by a letter that all my gold and some of my silver coins were sold : when I came to town I found them all gone ; I advertised them in several news-papers , that the public might have notice , that such a remarkable collection of English coins which are hardly to be found again in the Kingdom , from Edward the 3d to this time , were lost . Mr. Burgess a refiner came to my house , and brought me this parcel of coins , which I can swear are my own coins which I lost . It seems to be a little particular to swear to such a thing as money , and therefore I will give you a little trouble to show you that these are my own in Distinction from others , among these coins there is a counterfeit coin of Queen Elizabeth , it is silver gilt over , I have put it into the fire several times to remove the gilding which has done it some damage , and there are some pieces so remarkable in other respects that I can swear these are what were stole out of my house ; the Prisoner was brought to my house and afterwards taken to Sir Thomas De Veil 's to know how he came by these coins , and he said one David Gratrix ( who had been a Footman of my own ) had given them to him to dispose of . He said he lodged at the Bull and Gate in Holbourn ; there was an inquiry made after him , but the man was gone from that place , and the justice thought fit that the prisoner should be prosecuted : and I did consent he should be committed for further examination . When the justice was making his commitment , he was under some concern , and said , he believed he might take Gratrix at his own house , his saying that , is the occasion of my bringing him before you ; for as the prisoner has the character of an honest man , I inquired into the acquaintance that was between him and Gratrix , and I found he is his nephew , not his nephew by blood , but by affinity ; I thought it would be very hard to keep this man in prison , and therefore I thought fit to lay this thing before you , as I think it is my duty in order to do justice to my Country , that you may censure him as you think proper . Mr. Burgess . I am a refiner , the 30th of March the Prisoner brought some gold coins to know the most I could give for them ; I told him the most I could give was 3 l. 18 s. an ounce . He desired I would weigh them , and make a note of them . After I had bought them , I put them in a paper till I had an opportunity of looking them over . When I came to look them over , I had some reason to think that they belonged to some collection . My partner ( Mr. Scot ) immediately thought of Mr. White , and I went to Mr. White 's to know if they were his , and he told me they were his . Q . Had you seen the Advertiser then ? Burgess . No , not then ; I told Mr. White I would bring the man I bought them of , for he told me he lodged at the Bull and Gate in Holborn . I went there , they said he lodged there the night before , but was gone . Prisoner . I had those pieces of gold of my kinsman , and he sent me to Mr. Scot and Mr. Burgess to know what they would give , and they said 3 l. 18 s. I took them in a paper , carried them to Mr. Burgess , and he gave me the money , and I carried it to David Gratrix at the Bull Head alehouse in Wood Street , where he waited for me . George Cooks . I live at the Bull Head and three Turns in Wood Street , the Prisoner and a little man with his hair tied up like a livery servant came in , the Prisoner went out of the house , staid about a quarter of an hour , and brought a handful of gold and silver to this little man - I can not tell how long ago it was - I think he had a green livery coat on - White . He had not my livery . Q . How much money do you guess he brought to that man ? Cooks . I guess it to be about 30 l. - there was as much as he could grasp in his hand - both guineas and silver . Burgess . I think I paid the Prisoner about 33 l. it was within a few shillings more or less . It appeared by the evidence of William Bennet and Gregory Sewel that the Prisoner had caused this Gratrix to be apprehended in Southwark by Mr. Walker the constable . That he confessed to them that he did not come honestly by it , but before Justice Hammond he denied that he said any such thing ; and returning from the Justices he made his escape out of the Constable 's hand . Mr. Young Alworth ( clerk to Justice Hammond ) proved that the Justice had examined him , and made his commitment to goal for further examination . Mr. Scot and Mr. Burgess , by whom the Prisoner had been employed in their house , said , they verily believed him to be a very honest man : several other Persons gave him the like character . Acquitted . 282 . + Ann Barnett , otherwise Hall , of St. Margaret Westminster , was indicted for stealing a velvet hood , value 12 d. a pair of stockings , value 6 d. a shift , value 6 d. an apron , value 6 d. a purse , value 1 d. a straw hat , value 6 d. two Portugal pieces of gold , value 36 s. each , and two guineas , the property of Robert Damsell , in his dwelling-house , May 3 . Robert Damsell . I am watchman to Captain Dodd at the Savoy , I left the Prisoner with my wife as a nurse between seven and eight at night , when I came home between seven and eight in the morning the lady was gone .

In the bar there is a cupboard that my wife puts the money in ; she took the money out into a room which is by the bar , and told a 3 l. 12 s. two guineas and some silver , and put it into a tin box in the cupboard ( I saw all this ) and left her bunch of keys hanging in the door , in about a quarter of an hour she called me out , and I went into the room to her , and left the Prisoner in the bar , in about five minutes two gentlemen knocked at the door , who came to spend the evening with a distiller that this money was to be paid to : the Prisoner still continued in the bar , drank up his beer , and went away ; about a quarter of an hour after that my wife went to look for the money to pay the distiller , and the money was missing . Says she this man ( Proctor ) has taken the money away , what shall I do ? Said I , perhaps he has only taken it in jest - The Prisoner is a cage maker or wire worker by business , and used to come sometimes with the officers . I went to his lodging , his wife said he had been at home , but was gone out again . I went to Mr . Guy 's in Leadenhall Street to enquire after him , because he said he had been out with him to arrest some body , but he was not there .

Thomas Mortus . I have known the Prisoner fourteen years , every one that knows him knows him to be a silly man by way of jest , but as to stealing , I believe no body that knows him will give him that character - He works for me in the wire way , and if the court would please to realease him , I would employ him .
