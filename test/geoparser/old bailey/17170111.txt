They were a Second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquest for the same . They were likewise indicted a Third time upon the Statue of Stabbing for the same . Kelson , Shaw , and Calson , three Watchmen , depos 'd , That on the 30th of December last , at about 11 a Clock at Night , they going to enquire for their Master , the Constable , met the Prisoners in Drury-Lane in Company with one Mr. Moor , not yet taken , who seem 'd to be in a very quarrelsom Humour ; and that Mr. Moor said to them , What are you the Walking Watch ? They reply 'd , We are the Watch . He answer 'd G - d d - mn you , You 'll dance all Day long after a Gentleman to get a Pint of Drink of him . One of them replying , We ask nothing of you , Sir ; he return 'd , G - d d - mn you , if you did , I would sooner give you the Point of my Sword in your Guts shan Three Halfpence , and I would kill a Dozen of you for that Many , or Words to that Effect ; upon which Mr. Winchurst reply 'd , so would be too if he had a Sword . They thinking them bent upon Mischief , ( having taken Notice of some of them before for such Enterprizes ) to avoid a Fray turned away from them , going down Colson 's Court to seek for the Constable at the Horseshoe-Tavern ; where they did not find him , but found a Chair standing at the Door , and the Deceas 'd coming out of the Tavern and a Woman with him Arm in Arm . That the Woman persuaded the Deceas 'd to let the Watchman light him , to which he consented , saying he would give him something when he came to the Place where they were to go ; whereupon the Watchman lighted him along . They met the Prisoners in Holford 's Alley leaning their Heads against the Wall as if they had been Vomiting , and that presently Mr. Winchurst turned to the Deceas 'd and the Woman , as did also Mr.Bardet , and both of them jostled the Deceas 'd and Woman very rudely , Winchurst making use of very bawdy obscene Language : To which the Deceas 'd made no other Return , but Fie ! Gentlemen , what do you mean ? Why are you so uncivil ? Why do you affront me and my Wife ? and such like Language . And that without any other Prevocation , Mr. Winchurst cry 'd out , Draw , Burder , draw , G - d d - n you , Burdet , draw , urging him so to do . And Mr. Burdet not drawing so soon as he would have had him , he made two Offers to draw Mr.Burdet 's Sword ; but Burdet having his Hand upon the Hilt of his Sword , did not permit him , but immediately drew it himself , presenting the Point two or three times toward the Deceas 'd ; who feeing Burdet 's Sword drawn , also drew his Sword , and endeavour 'd to put himself in a Posture of Defence as well as his present unhappy Condition would permit : Whereupon Burdet retreated 2 or 3 Yards back , flourishing his Sword , and then advanced with great Fury , running upon the Deceas 'd , thrust him quite through the Body , bore him down backwards , and fell upon him , receiving at the same time a Wound on the Right side of his Chin by the Point of the Deceased 's Sword . John Wilson , Drawer at the Horseshoe-Tavern , depos 'd , that the Deceased came some time before thither with one Mary Lewis , being very much in Drink when he came in , and having had Three Pints of Wine , they were for going away , and that a Coach was call 'd , but none coming , they had provided a Chair , which stood ready at the Door : That the Deceas 'd and Mrs. Lewis going away while he had the Candle and Reckoning in his Hand , his Mistress perceiving that the Captain going out did not take the Chair that waited for him , but went with the Woman , she sent him immediately after him , least ( as she said ) he should come to some loss by her . He with the Candle and Money in his Hands stept immediately to the Door , askt the Chairmen how it came about they did not carry the Captain home : who reply 'd , they did ply him , but he refus 'd them ; whereupon he did them follow immediately , for he should be carried by them . He went as fast as he could , they following him , and when they were come near them they perceiv 'd Mr.Burdet run violently upon the Captain , bearing him down backwards and falling upon him , and that they took him from off the Deceased , taking up the Deceased also , and setting him up against the Wall , who stood about the space of a Minute , and then fell down ; That they open 'd his Breast but could not see the Wound ; but carrying him into the Tavern soon found where 't was , and sent immediately for a Surgeon , but before he could come he was dead ; the Prisoners first being apprehended by the Watchmen , Chairmen and himself . There were other Evidences , as Mary Lewis , the Woman who was with the Deceased , and several others who looked out at their Windows , and saw the Action , who corroborated the aforesaid Depositions in many of the material Circumstances relating to the Fact . Johnson Burdet pleaded in his Defence , That he thought the Deceased 's Sword was drawn when he drew his ; and that he had no Malice against the Deceased , having never seen him in his Life , Winchurst pleaded that they had been drinking , and very much in Drink as well as the Deceased ; and that the Alley was narrow , and that so they might jostle one another by chance , and that they did not do so designedly : He likewise insulted upon it that he had neither Sword nor Stick , nor had any Malice against the Deceas 'd , he being a Stranger to him . He pleaded likewise , that he would have prevented the Mischief , crying out , Sieze their Swords , Sieze their Swords , which the Watch acknowledged ; but at the same time depos 'd , that he did not do so till he saw the Deceas 'd kill 'd . And was the principal Cause of his being kill 'd , in being the first Beginner in the Fray , and the most violent Promoter of this Disaster . And as to that Plea of not having any Malice against the Deceased , they were answer 'd by the Lord Chief Baron Bury , and Mr. Justice Pratt , That those Persons who went upon such Adventures , first to pick Quarrels with peaceable Persons they met , and unknown to them too , and afterwards kill them , had Malice against all Mankind . They called some Persons to their Reputation , who indeed had so little to say for them , that the Jury considering the Barbarity and Inhumanity of the Crime , found them both Guilty of all three Indictments .

These are to acquaint the Nobility and Gentry , and all Lovers of Curiom Inventions , THAT there is now to be seen one of the greatest Pieces of Art in this Nature that ever was invented ; it being a Wonderful ASTRONOMICAL and MUSICAL CLOCK , which so surprisingly entertains the Company with so many various Curiosities , that the most ingenious declare it to be infinitely beyond what any can expect : It shewing the Motion of the Heavens to a very great Perfection , imitates the melodious Singing of Birds of Several Kinds , and performs on the Organ , Flute and Flageolet ; the performance being so curious , and the Particulars so many , that it would be too tedious to mention them . It is now at the first house on the Left-hand in Charlos Court in the strand near Hungerford-Market ( in the same House where the Moving Skeleton is shewn . ) N.B . Attendance is given from 10 in the Morning till 9 at Night , and shewn by the Author Christopher Pinchbeek , whose dwelling is at Smithfield-Bars , London . For the Good of the Publick . WHereas several Gentlewomen and others of that Sex , in this Kingdom , have contracted an evil Habit of Body , wherein the vicious Humours , at first dispers 'd thro ' the Whole , come at length to be lodg 'd in one Part or another , and many times , for Causes too long to be here mentioned , are thrown down upon the Womb , occansioning a dangerous Weakness in that Part , which being neglected , at lustturus Cancerous , and often proves Fatal . I cure the Diabetes when given over by all other Persons . This is to acquaint all such as may have occasion , that a speedy Relief is to be had from an Experienc 'd Midwife , dwelling at the Sign of the Queen 's Arms , a Watch-Makers , near Exeter Exchange in the strand , who perform 'd a Cure upon a lady at the Bath , after she was given over by the Physicians , and since has Cured several Gentlewomen and others in the City and suburbs of London . I should not have put my self in Publick Print , but to satisfy the Afflicted where they may have present Ease and Relief . To all Gentlemen , Ladies , and others , who are Lovers of Curiosities . THE MOVING SKELETON , or the Skeleton of a Man , which performs such strange and wonderful Actions , that none can Credit , but those who have already seen it , to whom it has given a general Satisfaction . And that it may be less surprising to the Spectators , I have here Inserted its several Performances , which are as follow , ( viz ) 1 . At the knocking at the Case in which the skeleton stands , the Door immediately flies open . 2 . The Curtain which hangs before it gently draws up out of sight , which presents to your View , a Humane skeleton , with an Hour-Glass in one Hand , and a Dart in the other . 3 . He first raises that Hand with the Hour-Glass , which has a few sands to run , and when those are spent . 4 . He raises the other Hand with the Dart , and makes Three Offers with it , as if stricking at a Person . 5 . He then opens his Mouth and Groans 3 times most surprisingly . 6 . He then again with his Jaw , strikes the Hour past on a Bell . 7 . He lets down his Hand with the Hour-Glass . 8 . He lets down his Hand with the Dart . 9 . A Pipe of Tobacco being put in his Mouth , he lights it himself . 10 . He blows the Candle out and smoaks his Pipe as naturally as any living Person can do , till being gently mov 'd with a Stick : upon which . 11 . He immediately opens his Jaw for the Pipe to be taken from him . 12 . The Curtain then falls down into its Place , and all is over . It is now to be seen at the First House on the Left-Hand in Charles-Court , in the strand , in the same House where the Wonderful Machine the Astronomical and Musical Clock is shewn . At her House the Red Ball in Queen-street , Cheapside , near the Three Craners , LIveth a Gentlewoman that hath a most incomparable Wash to beautifie the Face , which far exceeds all that are extant , as abundance of the greatest Quality have found by Experience , to their great Satisfaction . It takes out all manner of Wrinkles , Freckles , Pimples , Redness , Morphew , Sun-born , Yellowness , caus 'd by Mercurial poisonous Washes : It also plumps and softens the Skin , making it as smooth and tender as a sucking Child 's : The Young it always keeps so , and the Old it makes appear Fair and Young to Admiration . It has nothing of Paint in it , neither doth any Person know the Secret . You may have from Half a Crown to Five Pounds the Bottle . You may have Ponatums , White-pots , the like not to be compared with ; also a Powder for the Teeth , which makes them as white as Snow . She hath a most excellent Secret to prevent Hair from falling , causing it to grow wherever it is wanting . She alters Red or Grey Hair to a delicate light or dark Brown in a few Days , which will never change . She shapes the Eye-brows , and makes them beautiful . She hath a delicate paste to whiten the Hands , and a Red Pomatum to colour the Lips , and prevents their chopping in Winter . She has a certain and insallible Cure for the Toothach , without drawing , that the Pain will not return . Note , Remov 'd from the Cheshire-Cheese in Walbrook . LONDON : Printed for J.
