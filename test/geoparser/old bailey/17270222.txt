That he then bought the said Goods of Steward Dormer , the Prisoner at the Bar , for which he paid him 19 Pounds . Steward Dormer in his Defence said , That one Waller had confess 'd a Judgement to him of the aforesaid Goods , which he pretended was his Property , the said Waller owing him 21 Pounds ; but as he immediately served an Execution , and the Goods amounting to the Value of 80 Pounds , the Court thought fit to examine Woller of his Right and Title , and the Means that could induce him to such Proceedings . Waller depos 'd . That he took the House and had Goods in it as well as the Prosecutor ; and as the House was properly his , and the Goods his own , he thought himself guilty of no Misdemeanor .

That she saw Waller write a Note , in which he made over all Pretension to the House , and he resigned it intirely to Mr. Salmon ; and that when the Officers was in the House , she heard Waller say , that he was only sorry that he had made such a Note : But this having but little regard to the Indictment laid against Steward Dormer , he was acquitted .

That he knew the Prisoner at the Bar , before he saw him on Endfield-Chace at the Time aforesaid , when the Fact aforementioned was committed ; and that he had given Information thereof upon Oath , before Sir Thomas Clargis , which Information was read in Court , and by which it evidently appear 'd that he was the Person , who in Conjunction with William Gates , call 'd Vulcan , and others , kill 'd two Fallow Deer & c.

To which Henry Best reply 'd , in a facetious Manner , It is true , I said so in Newgate ; for finding my self among a pack of Rogues , who had just before pick 'd my Pocket without Occasion . I know not what they would have done , had I told them I would swear against one of their Comrades . The Jury brought him in Guilty . Death . Samuel Vevers , of the Parish of St. Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted , for that he did on the 5th of February last , stop the Chariot of Justice Hall , between Hackney and Dalston , taking from him a Watch and Chain , Value seven Pounds , and about twenty five Shillings in Money . Justice Hall depos 'd . That on the 5th of February last , a Person , whom he did verily believe to be the Prisoner at the Place aforesaid , about seven in the Evening , stopp 'd his Chariot , and demanded his Money , and that 3 Days after the Prisoner was taken , he distinguished him from among 16 or 18 People , though he did not know he had then ever seen him , but on the Night he was robbed , and that it then being a Star-light Night , he could perfectly discover the Beast on which he rode , to be a dark brown , or black , and that the Person who robb 'd him had on a loose riding Coat . John Williams depos 'd . That he was in the Chariot with Justice Hall ; and that the Highway Man came on that Side the Chariot on which he sat , and after demanding the Money of Justice Hall , he then made the like Demand on this Deponent , who gave him about ten Shillings , bidding them put the Money into his Hat : After which he rode gently towards Hummerton , swearing . This Deponent further depos 'd . That he saw the Prisoner at the Bar in Newgate some Days after he was taken , and that he had then so perfect and Idea of the Person that robb 'd them , that when he came in the Room where the Prisoner was , though there was seven or eight persons in Company , he at once fix 'd his Eyes on the Prisoner with Surprize ; verily believing him to be the Person who committed the Fact at the Time and Place aforesaid . John Aldridge , Coachman , depos 'd positively , That the Prisoner at the Bar was the Person who stopp 'd his Master 's Chariot , and that he stopp 'd on the Top of the Hill , and turning short , bid this Deponent stand ; and that he then putting forward , demanded Money of his Master and Mr. Willson ; telling them , Money he wanted , and Money he would have ; for he was a Gentleman of Resolution . That when his Master put the Money into his Hat , he said he must have more : The Justice finding some more , and giving it him , he hastily said , What is this Half-pence . Sure such a Gentleman as you ca n't be without some Gold ; on which the Justice pulling up the Lappits of his Cloaths , and offering to be search 'd , he espied the Chain of his Watch , and took it , and upon his Master 's telling him , he valued the Seal , as having his Coat of Arms , desired he might have it , it being of little Value to another , which he promised to send at another Opportunity , after asking his Name and place of Abode . Thomas Davis , Footman to the Justice , who was then behind the Chariot , deposed to the like Effect , with this further Argument for Confirmation , That he had seen the prisoner ride by his Master 's Door , and had took particular Notice of his Mare , both as to Heighth , Shape , and her Sprig-tail ; and that when his Master sent him to enquire after such a Beast of George Cann , a Farrier in Shoreditch , who brought him to the Sight of a Mare belonging to the Prisoner at the Bar , and that waiting at an Alehouse in Holloway Lane , he heard the prisoner swear at a Person for driving a Brick Cart beyond its Place , and that then he knew him by the Accent of his Voice , but when he saw him , he had a further Confirmation , and was sure the Prisoner at the Bar was the person that robb 'd his Master .

It appeared that the Prosecutor and the Prisoner being both of a loving Disposition , had agreed to go together to a Bawdy House , and that the Prosecutor awaking at Three in the Morning , mist both the Watch and his Bedfellow ; but the Watch he lost , which may learn him another Time to be a little more watchful .
