Thomas Middleton , of the Parish of St. Mary le Bow , was indicted for feloniously stealing 50 lb . of Lead , value 5 s. the Goods of Rene De Boyville , on the 3d of this Instant January . He was a second time indicted for feloniously stealing 150 lb . of Lead , value 15 s. the Goods of Nathaniel Garland , on the 8th of this Instant January . Mr. De Boyville . Last Monday Seven-night the Lead of my Son 's Coffin was taken from the Vault in Bow Church . He was Buried there in the Year 1721 . I bought the Coffin of Thomas Reynolds , the Undertaker . Mr. Reynolds . The Prosecutor bought the Coffin of me . I saw it sodder 'd up , and the Body of his Son was then within it . And afterwards I attended the Funeral , and saw the same Coffin put into Bow Church Vault in February 1721. Francis Warner . Last Monday Sev'n-night , between Four and Five in the Morning , the Prisoner came to me with this Mallet and Chissel , and we went together into Bow Church Vault , and there he cut the Lead and Plate off of Mr. Boyville 's Son 's Coffin . I knew it to be his Coffin , because there was an Inscription upon it . I help 'd him to carry the Lead to Mr. Moore in King-street , in Old-Street-Square , who gave us at the Rate of 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it . The Prisoner was under Grave-Digger of Aldgate , and I am sometimes 'employ 'd as a Bearer , by Mr. Robinson , the Sexton , of Bow Church . The Prisoner got the Key of the Vault of Mr. Robinson 's Maid Mary , who will let him have it at any time , because he gives her now and then a Penny , or two Pence . Robert Moore . I bought the Lead of the Prisoner about Eight o'Clock last Monday Morning was Seven-night . There was a Hundred and three Quarters all cut to Pieces . I ask 'd him how he came by it ? he said , that he was employ 'd in clearing the Vaults at Aldgate Church , and the Church Wardens gave him leave to take it as a Perquisite , and make the best o n't . Prisoner . You said , bring what ye will , and I 'll buy it of ye . I have often sold you Coffin Handles ; but as for the Lead , was it I or Warner that brought it to you ? Moore . Warner was with you , but it was you that deliver 'd the Lead to me , and took the Money . John Newton . On the same Day Mr. Williamson brought three Hundred and a half of Lead to me , and I bought it of him at 13 s. a Hundred . One of my Men said , this Lead smells so strong of dead Corps that it almost choaks me . Phoo ! says I , that 's only your fancy ! But in two or three Days having occasion to melt some of it , I found this Piece among it , with this Inscription : Mr. Rene De Boyville Obijt Jan. 29th 1721. in the 16th Year of his Age . Upon which I went to Mr. Boyville and inform 'd him of it . Seth Williamson . I keep an Old-Iron Shop in Chissel-street . Mr. Moore came to me for some Iron to make Coffin Handles , and said he had some Lead to sell . I bought upwards of 300 Weight of him at 11 s. a Hundred , which I sold to Mr. Newton at 13 s. a Hundred . I asked Moore , who he bought it of ? He said of some Grave-Diggers who had it for Perquisites . Prisoner . Warner told me that he had Orders from Mr . Prior , the Church-Warden of Bow Church , to clear the Vault . And when I went down with him , he said , This is a good Place , my other Perquisites are but small , and when these Things [ Iron , Lead and Nails ] are gone , my Business will be worth nothing . Warner . A little while ago the Sexton gave me leave to go down and level the Floor of the Vault . The Prisoner went with me , and taking one of the Candles he look 'd all round the Vault . Lord ! says he , What a Sight of Brass Nails and Handles here is ? What a pity it is they should lie and spoil here , when I can have 2 d. a Pound for the worst Handle among them ? Prisoner . There 's Mr. Hall , the Common-Council Man , knows me , and can give me a Character . Mr. Hall . I know he has been Under-Grave-Digger in Aldgate Parish for four or five Years . We have had some suspicion of him , - and Yesterday we searched the South-Vault of the Church , and found it all robb 'd , - and Nobody had the Key but him and his Master , and his Master hears a very honest Character . John Maxey . I have known Warner come to the Prisoner before Five in the Morning , and say , Come Tom , I have got the Key , the Church-Warden has given me leave to rummage the Vault . Warner . I never said any such thing , nor ever had such Orders given me by the Church-Warden . Second Indictment . Nathaniel Garland . About the 30th of March 1726 , my Brother was Buried in Bow Church Vault . I was Administrator , and order 'd Mr. Stephen Roome , Undertaker in Fleet-street , to make a Wooden and a Leaden Coffin , but I did not see the Corps put in . John Paine . I saw the Deceased put into the Coffin , and afterwards Interr 'd in the Vault ; and hearing last Saturday that the Vault had been robb 'd , I enquir 'd after Mr. Garland 's Coffin . Warner told me , the Coffin was taken quite away , and the Corps thrown on the Ground , and shew 'd me the place where it lay . I knew the Body by two Things ; the Deceas 'd had been Lame , and one of his Legs was shorter than the other ; and after his Death his Body was open 'd for the Satisfaction of his Friends to know what Distemper he dy 'd of . Warner . Last Saturday Morning between 4 and 5 the Prisoner went into the Vault with this Mallet and Chissel . He broke the Wooden Coffin , and then cut the Sides of the Leaden one , and tumbled the Corps out upon the Ground , and cover 'd it with the Saw-Dust that came out of the Coffin . Says I , this Corps will soon be discover 'd by the smell if ye leave it here , and then I shall come into a scrape , and my Master may lose his place : No , says he , it has been Buried so long that there 's no fear of smelling . Then he cut the Lead to Pieces , and we carried it to Mr. Moore . There was about one Hundred and a half of it . When Mr. Paine came to me , I ript up the Shrond , and shew 'd him the Body . The Shroud look 'd as fresh and as white as the Shirt on your Lordship 's Back . Prisoner . Did not you take the Mallet out of our Vestry ? - 'T is the very Thing that Alderman Parsons knocks with . And did not you borrow the Chissel of your Brother-in-Law ? Warner . No , you brought them both to me . Prisoner . And will you swear too that you did not carry the Lead to Moore ? Warner . I helped to carry it . And when we came to Moore he seemed unwilling to buy it at first for fear of Trouble . What a Plague in Hell are ye afraid of ? says the Prisoner , Do n't ye know that I rummage the Church at Aldgate , and that these are my Perquisites ? - Well , but ( says Moore ) you promis 'd to bring me some Coffin Handles . And so I will to Morrow , says the Prisoner , as I hope to be saved , - upon my Life and Soul , - the Devil fetch me if I do n't . - And so Moore paid us for the Lead , but stopp 'd a Shilling till the Prisoner brought the Handles . Moore . I would have stopp 'd the Lead , but they said it was their Perquisites , and they came honestly by it , and so I gave them 9 s. 4 d. a Hundred for it , which is the Price that all Old-Iron Shops give . Prisoner . Warner brought me into the Secret , and said this and that , and t'other , and that I was safe enough , and he could get the Key of Mary , the Sexton 's Maid , and would I go one time and another time ? But I refus 'd to go several times , till at last he persuaded me there was no Danger in it . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of both Indictments . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 2. Susan Bonning , of St. Botolph without Bishopsgate , was indicted for stealing a Callicoe Gown , value 12 s. 2 Petticoats , value 10 s. 1 Cambrick Handkerchief , value 1 s. 6 d. and a half Guinea , and 10 s. 6 d. in Silver , the Goods and Money of Benjamin Hill ; and a Gold Ring , value 8s . the Goods of John Swift , in the House of Robert Phips , the 14th of December last . Mary Hill . I lost the Things in the Indictment ; and about a Fortnight after this , the Prisoner was carried to the Watch-House at Bishopsgate , and sent for my Son and me , and she confess 'd to us and the Constable that she had stolen the Goods and Money , only as I charged her with 22 s. She said there was but 21 s. Hosier Swift . I saw my Mother 's Things in the Trunk on the Sunday before she lost 'em . In the Evening of the same Day as my Mother was robb 'd , the Prisoner came to me and borrow 'd a Ridinghood and a Holland Apron of two Breadths , and said , She was going to a Play , but would make me drink first , and so she took me to the Black Raven Tavern in Bishopsgate-street , and there she shew 'd me two half Guineas and 16 s. and told me that she never went without Gold and Silver in her Pocket . Mary Hill . The Prisoner told me that Morning that she had not 2 d. in the World . Prisoner . I have had great Misfortunes for 10 Years past . I own I borrow 'd the Riding-hood of Mrs . Swift , tho ' I never carried it Home again ; but as for stealing Mrs. Hill 's Goods and Money I know Little of it . The Jury acquitted her . 3 , 4. William Moss and Humphrey Beach , of Queenhith , were indicted for stealing 2 Dozen of Muslin Handkerchiefs , value 30 s. 5 Dozen of Cotton Handkerchiefs , value 54 s. 50 Yards of Holland , value 6 l. 8 Damask Table Cloths , val . 6 l. 5 Diaper Table Cloths , value 25 s. 9 Caps , value 5 s. 12 Yards of Tabling Diaper , value 30 s. and several Pair of Stockings , the Goods of Daniel White , the 9th of November last . Daniel White . I sent five Parcels of Goods to the Windsor Row-Barge , and directed them for my self to be left at the Warehouse at Windsor till call 'd for . When I went to ask for these Parcels at Windsor , I found but three of them , the other two being lost . Most of the Goods in those two Parcels were stopt by Justice Lade , who advertis 'd them . I went to his Worship , and found all my Goods except a Box of Headcloths , 2 Dozen of Handkerchiefs , two Diaper Table Cloths , and some Stockings . Robert Taylor . I took the five Parcels of the Prosecutor about Four in the Afternoon , in the beginning of November , and saw them safe stow 'd in the Windsor Row-Barge , and two of the five Parcels were afterwards lost out of the Barge . James Crawford , Waterman . On the 10th of November , as I was standing at Cupid 's Bridge , where I ply , the Prisoner Beach past me , and went into the King 's Head Alehouse . A Peter Boat had been robb 'd a little before , and Beach was suspected to have been concern 'd in it , he having dispos 'd of some Fish and other Things which were thought to have been taken out of that Boat , and so I and some other Watermen agreed to take him . We went and found him and Moss ( the other Prisoner ) sitting by the Fire , and two Parcels of Goods lying by them . We seized Beach , but Moss got by us and hid himself in the Cellar , where we afterwards found him . They gave no account how they came by the Goods , and so were carried before Justice Lade . The Goods were open 'd there , and I saw Stockings , Diaper , and other Shop Goods . Several other Witnesses confirm 'd the above James Crawford 's Evidence . Prisoner , Moss . As I was standing by the Pump at Margaret's-Hill , a Man and a Woman came by with two Bundles . She asked me to lend her a Hand , and she would satisfy me for my Pains . I took one of the Bundles , and went with her to this Alehouse at Cupid 's Bridge , where we sat down to drink , and when the Watermen came in , she and that Man ran away , which made me fear I was got into a scrape , and so I hid myself . The Jury acquitted Beach , and found Moss guilty . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 5. Robert Peck , of St. Mary Colechurch , was indicted for privately stealing eight Volumes of the Abridgement of the Statutes , value 30 s. Langley 's Young Builder 's Rudiments , value 5 s. and Kersey 's Dictionary , value 2 s. the Goods of John Noon , in his Shop , the 27th of December last . John Noon . The Books lay on my Counter , and between 5 and 6 in the Evening as my Spouse was in the back Part of the Shop , she saw a Man go out , upon which she called me , and I miss 'd the Books . Next Morning I sent my Servant among the Booksellers to desire them to stop such Books if offer 'd to Sale . About Noon , the same Day , Mr. King came to my Shop , saying such Books were stopt . I went to his Mother 's Shop in Fore-street , and there I found one Dowles , who said he had the Books of three Men , who were at the Swan and Hoop Alehouse . Mr. King , and I and Dowles went thither , and found them . A scuffle ensued . They endeavour 'd to break from us . The Prisoner stabb 'd me in the Shoulder with a Penknife . I call 'd for Assistance , and up came A Gentleman Soldier , and wrestled with him . The two others got off , Dowles follow 'd them . Jacob Dowle . I formerly kept a Book-Stall in Moorfields , but was forc 'd to leave off thro ' Misfortunes . The Prisoner and two more sent for me to an Alehouse , the Prisoner gave me the Books , and bid me make the most of them , for they were in haste . I went to the Widow King 's , at the Bible and Crown in Forestreet , where I was stopp 'd . Richard King . I went to the Alehouse with Mr . Noon and Dowle , and there we found the Prisoner and the other Men . I ask 'd Dowle which of them deliver 'd the Books to him , and he said the Prisoner . Prisoner . I met an old Ship-mate and another , and we went to drink at the Black Bull in Petticoat-Lane ; Dowle came to us , and my Ship-mate said he had some Books to sell , but they were at his Lodgings over the way . Dowle went with him thither , and fetch 'd the Books , and then we went together to the Swan and Hoop by Moorfields , where he left us , and went to sell the Books ; he staid above half an Hour , and then came with Mr . Noon and Mr. King . My Ship mate and the other ran out , and Dowle after them , and then a Soldier knock 'd me down . I ow 'd Money , and was afraid of an Arrest , which made me struggle to get off . Dowle has been in Goal several times . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 6.

My Apprentice ask 'd the Prisoner 's Girl Saily , what good Things her Mother used to carry to Mr. Coats 's ? and the Child said , whole Cheeses . When the Prisoner came in , he told her that Coats would have he bring something good as she used to do . Oh ! she says , I know what he means , - 't is Dog's-meat . As soon as I was inform 'd of this , I sent my Man to Coats 's , under pretence of buying some Cheese , to see if he could find any with my mark , and he brought back Coats himself , and this Cheese , which I knew to be mine by my mark DXP ; Coats confess 'd he bought this and three more of the Prisoner . Benjamin Holding . By my Master 's Orders I went to Coats 's House , and there found this Cheese , which I knew to be my Master 's by the mark .

The Prisoner was Nurse to a poor Woman who was sick in Norton-Falgate Workhouse . The Church-Wardens hearing the poor Woman was dead , went and turn 'd the Prisoner out of the Room , and lock 'd the Door . At Night the Prisoner and a Man broke the Door open , and took away the Goods . The Prisoner in her Defence said , that the Deceas 'd on her Death-Bed bequeathed her those Goods for the Care she had taken in attending on her , and that the Church-Wardens shut her out to hinder her from taking them ; the Jury acquitted her . 10. Robert Hallam , of St. Ann 's , in Middlesex , was indicted , for that he by a Devilish Instigation , and of his Malice afore-thought , on the 9th of December last , on Jane his Wife , then being great with Child , and in a Room one Pair of Stairs high , did make an Assault with both his Hands , and out of a Window in the said Room did throw the said Jane upon a Stone-Pavement , whereby she was mortally bruised on her Back , Loins , and other Parts , of which she instantly Died , and so he wilfully and of Malice afore-thought did Kill and Murder the said Jane . He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . At the Prisoner 's Desire the Witnesses against him were examined apart . Charles Bird , the Prisoner 's Apprentice . On Wednesday the 9th of December , about 11 at Night , I went to Bed , and fell asleep , but was awaked by a Noise between 12 and 1 . I heard my Mistress ( in the Room under me ) cry Murder ! For God 's Sake do n't murder me ! For the Lord 's Sake , Robin , do n't murder me ! Pity me ! for Christ 's Sake ! - for my poor Family 's Sake ! - Then she call 'd me , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! and once she cry 'd louder than ordinary . The Prisoner said , G - d d - n you , what do you want with Charles ? I was afraid he would come up to me , and so I stepp 'd out of Bed , and was going to get out of the Window , to save my self , but a Child that lay with me ( who was lame , and could not speak plain , tho ' it was ten Years old ) cry 'd Sharly ! Sharly ! do no go . Then I consider 'd with my self , that by venturing out at Window I might be accessary to my own Death , and so I went to Bed again . I heard a great many very violent Blows , which by the Sound seem 'd to be given with the Tongs , or the Fire-shovel . By and by the Neighbours cry 'd Murder ! and I heard the Street-Door open , which I thought the People without had broke open . Then I said within my self , By the leave of the Lord I will venture out , as soon as the Mob comes in ; but presently I heard the Prisoner come up Stairs into his own Chamber . Prisoner . How do you know it was I that came up , when you did not see me ? Bird . Because as soon as you came up I heard you scolding again - I got up , and was going down Stairs , about 6 in the Morning , I heard a low Voice ( which I thought was my Mistres 's ) and it said , Charles , go and strike a Light , and take the Tin Pot and draw some Beer . I did so , and brought it up . And the Voice said again , Set it down upon the Chest and leave it there . I did so ; but I neither saw his nor her Face , for they were both cover 'd in the Bed . - Then the Voice bid me make a Fire , which I did ; and while I was blowing it up I heard 2 or 3 dismal Groans . Then I went to my Work . Court . What Work . Bird . The Prisoner is a Waterman , and I am his 'Prentice - I went to the Plying-Place , which is a Stone 's Throw from our Alley . This was between 6 and 7 o'Clock ; and about 8 Job Allen came to me , and told me my Mistress was dead . Then I have lost a very good Mistress , said I ; and with that I ran home to know the Truth of it ; and there I saw Dr. Smith , and the Constable , and the Prisoner , and I found it was too true ! my poor Mistress was dead indeed ! - Then I went to my Work again . Prisoner . How do you know but it was your Mistress that came up Stairs ? for you said you thought it was me , only because you heard my Voice after I was come up . Bird . I thought it was not possible that my Mistress shou 'd come up Stairs so readily , after the Blows that she received , and the Groans and Cries that she made . Prisoner . Did you hear us both go down ? Bird . I do n't remember that I heard any more than one . Prisoner . Did not you come home to Dinner the Day before this happened , and your Mistress told you she 'd give you no Victuals , for she intended to make away with her self ? Bird . No . I came home to Dinner , and there was cold Beef ; I desir 'd her to let me broil it , and she said , with all her Heart ; I might do as I wou 'd - She was as good a Woman as ever broke Bread . Ann Anderson . I live next Door to the Prisoner , there is but a thin Deal-Partition betwixt his Room and ours , so that one may hear in one Room what passes in the other , very plainly - Between 11 and 12 on Wednesday Night , while I was in Bed , I heard the Prisoner say to his Wife , G - d d - n you ! tell me the Truth . - Several Blows were given - I awaked my Husband , and said , D 'ye hear ? Hallam 's a beating his Wife , according to Custom . Then she got from him , ran down Stairs , and out at the Street-Door ; he follow 'd ; I open 'd my Window , and saw him beat her in the Street , and force her in again . He shut the Door , and while she was in the Entry I heard her cry very loud , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! When they came into the Chamber , I heard a great many unmerciful Blows , which by the jarring Sound I thought to be given with the Fire-shovel or Tongs ; and , as if her Breath was almost gone , she cry 'd , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! - I thought the Blows were more like beating an Ox than a Christian ! a Woman big with Child ! Soon after , she cry 'd , O Robin ! spare my Life ! do n't kill me ! for God 's Sake ! for Christ 's Sake ! for my poor Infant 's Sake ! - Then I heard a struggling and a rustling towards the Window - she gave a lamentable great Shrick , and presently I heard something rush from the Window with such Violence that I thought the Window-Frame had follow 'd . This was between 12 and 1 . I jump 'd out of Bed , ran to the Window , and look 'd out . He ran down Stairs , and came out of the Door in his Shirt , with a Candle in his Hand ; his Wife was lying in the Street . He damn 'd her for a Bitch , and said she was drunk . He set down the Candle on a Bench , and taking her by the Arms , dragg 'd her backward up the Steps into the Entry , and shut the Door ; as he was hauling her in , I called out , You Villain ! you wicked Rogue ! you have thrown your Wife out of the Window , and kill 'd her ! All the Neighbours were alarm 'd , and several came out , and said , For Christ 's Sake do n't use the poor Woman so , but let some Body help her ; but he would let no Body . After he had got her in , I heard several Groans , and thought she might be in Labour , for she was so near her Time , that she look 'd every Hour , but about 6 she dy 'd , and half an Hour after he went out and brought a Mid wife . O ye Villian , said I , you have call 'd a Midwife , now your Wife is dead ! About 9 I went in when the Doctor was there , and he said she had been dead a long Time . Her Right-Hand was cut all a-cross the Fingers , and the Window-Post was bloody with strugling . The Prisoner said , see how the wicked Jade has cut her Hand with the Glass-Window in getting out . But I look 'd , and there was not one Pane of Glass broke , nor was any of the Glass bloody , but only the Post . Prisoner . Where was I when you talk 'd about cutting her Hand with the Glass ? Ann Anderson . In your Room . Prisoner . Have not you ow 'd me a Spight these 2 Years . Ann Anderson . His Wife shew 'd me her Arms twice , a good while ago , and they were as black as your Lordship 's Gown , and therefore he has bore me Malice ever since . Swan Anderson , the Husband of the last Witness . On Wednesday the 9th of December , the Prisoner came Home between 11 and 12 at Night , and begun to scold at , and beat and abuse his Wife ; she thought to escape by running down Stairs , but he was too nimble for her , and catch 'd her just without the Street-Door , and beat her so barbarously , that he rais 'd all the Neighbours , who cry 'd out , shame on him . He beat her thro ' the Entry up Stairs , and in the Chamber she cry 'd , Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! and afterwards , O Robin ! - What are you going to do ? - For God 's Sake spare my Life ! - Do n't kill me ! - for Christ 's Sake ! - for my poor Family 's Sake . Then I heard a strugling , a rustling like the rustling of a Tarpaulin , the Woman gave a great shriek , and something rush 'd out of the Window at once - I could hear very plain , for there 's only a Deal Partition betwixt my Room and the Prisoner 's - I and my Wife jump 'd out of Bed , and went to our Window . The Prisoner came out of his Door with a Candle in his Hand . His Wife was then lying on the Stone Pavement , she lay like a Log , and neither stirr 'd Hand nor Foot . He set down the Candle , took her by the Shoulders , and haul 'd her upon her Back up 3 Steps . - My Wife and other Neighbours call 'd to him , and cry 'd , Murder ! He took no Notice of them , but dragg 'd her in , and shut the Door fast . - Then he dragg 'd her up Stairs . - It must be he that did it , for No-body was there to do it but himself , - and I heard several heavy Groans ; but whether they were hers or his , I do n't know . Prisoner . Did she walk up Stairs herself , or did I drag her ? Swan Anderson . Walk ! No , it was impossible she should . Prisoner . Did you not afterwards hear her speak in the Chamber ? Swan Anderson . No , I heard you mutter something to your self , but I believe she was not able to speak . Prisoner . Did you not hear her Voice ? Swan Anderson . No . John Fleming . I have lived next Door to the Prisoner 3 Years , - there 's only a thin Partition between us , so that I can hear every Word that 's spoke in his Room . For this 12 Month past , I have frequently heard great Out-cries of Murder . And particularly about 3 Weeks before her Death , he came home in a jealous Fit , and beat her , and swore he 'd Murder her , if he was hang 'd for it . I heard her cry , O for God 's sake Mercy ! Pity me ! - Pity the tender Infant within me ! Damn ye , for a Bitch , says he , I 'll send you , and your Infant to the Devil together ! - I 'll split your Skull , and dash your Brains against the Back of the Chimney - I know I shall come to be hang 'd at Tyburn for ye . And that Night as she was kill 'd , I heard him beating her again , and a great many Blows he gave her . She begg 'd , For God 's Sake ! - For Christ Jesus 's Sake ! and for her poor Children 's Sake ! that he would not kill her ! and she call 'd , Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! and gave a great Shrick ! Then I heard Mrs. Anderson get out of her Bed , throw open her own Window , and cry out , He has thrown his Wife out of Window ! I struck a light , and saw it was then about half an Hour after 12 . Mr. Anderson and his Wife lodge in the fore Part of the House , and I in the back Part . After the Prisoner was taken by Mr. Betty , the High-Constable , I heard him say , I will not wrong my Conscience , I believe the Blows I gave her , and my threatening to fetch my Cane , was the Cause of her going out of the Window , but I was not in the Chamber at that time . He was before the Justice 8 or 10 Months ago for abusing her , and throwing her upon the Bed , while he had a Knife in his Mouth , and swearing he would rip her up . Prisoner . Did not you hear me in another Room when the Out-cry was of her being thrown out of the Window ? Fleming . No . Prisoner . Did you hear the Blows ? Fleming . Yes . Prisoner . And did not they found as if they were struck against a Door to get it open ? Fleming . No , they founded as if struck against a Human Body . Prisoner . Did you see my Wife after her Death ? Had she any marks ? Fleming . Yes . All her left Side was black - and the Body of the Child within was black , and part of its Head was greenish , - but I did not take very particular Notice . Ann Anderson , again . The Constable order 'd me to search the Body . I found a great many Marks and Spots of black and blue that must be made by dreadful Blows . James Furnell . I and Richard Horseford were accidentally coming through the Street that Night , and I believe near 100 Yards before we came to the Prisoner 's House I heard the blows , and an outcry of O ! O ! with some other Words , but I could not tell exactly what those Words were . As we came nearer , the Cries encreas 'd , and says I to Mr. Horseford , This Fellow will kill his Wife . No , says he , 't is only a Family Quarrel , and they 'll be good Friends again by and by . We pass 'd the Door , for we were going to a House a little beyond , but looking about we thought we were gone too far , and so turning back , I heard the Woman say twice or thrice , For God 's Sake , Robin , save my Life ! - Do n't throw me out o'Window ! - I did not imagine that the Fellow would be such a Villain to do it , for if we had thought he would , I believe we could have catch 'd her and broke her fall ; but suddenly the Casement burst open , and she came out with her Back foremost , and fell down on the Stones . There was a Candle in the Chamber , and I saw a Man there , near the Window , which I believe was the Prisoner , but I am not sure of it . I was within 8 or 10 Yards of her when she fell , she groaned , but was not able to rise . Presently the Prisoner came down with the Candle in his Hand , went to his Wife , and took her by one Arm to lift her up , but finding her helpless , he said , G - d d - n ye , ye Drunken Bitch , get up ! She had nothing on but a Shirt , a Flannel Petticoat , a thin loose Gown , and one Shoe ; but neither Stockings nor Cap . Then the Prisoner set down the Candle , took her by both Arms , dragg 'd her in , and lock 'd the Door . We went and acquainted the Watch with it , but they took no farther Notice than to Laugh at it , and next Morning I heard she was dead . Prisoner . Did you see me push her out ? Furnell . No ; I saw you , or some Man like you , near the Window ; and before she came out , I heard a rustling , as if it was in Opposition , and as she came out she gave a terrible shrick . Prisoner . If you saw her fall , why did not you help her up ? Furnell . I heard you coming down , - when you came out you was in your Shirt and Night-cap . Prisoner . You could hear things very plain ! Furnell . It was a very still Night , I was a Stranger to both you and your Wife . Richard Horseford . On the 9th of December , between 12 and 1 in the Morning , I was coming along Ropemaker's-Fields with Mr. Furnell , and just as we turned out of Church-Lane , I heard several Blows , and coming nearer , a Woman 's Voice cry 'd , For God 's Sake , Robin , spare my Life ! - Murder ! - For God 's Sake spare my Life this time . This Fellow will kill his Wife , says Mr. Furnell ; no , says I , 't is only a Family-Quarrel , and we shall get no Thanks for meddling betwixt a Man and his Wife ; and so we pass 'd the Door , and went forward , but thinking we were got beyond the place we intended to go to , we turned back , and heard the Woman cry , For God 's Sake , Robin , do n't throw me out at Window ! - For the Lord 's Sake ! - For Christ 's sake ! - spare my Life ! - I look 'd up towards the Window , and suddenly the Casement flew open , and at once the Woman came out with her Back foremost . I saw the glympse of a Man in the Room , - I was 10 or 12 Yards off when she fell , - She lay at length on her Back like one dead , - Just as we came to her , a Man came out in his Shirt with a Candle in his left Hand , and he put his right Hand under her Arm to lift her up , and said , G - d d - n ye , ye Drunken Bitch , get up ; but finding he could not manage her with one Hand , he set down the Candle , and dragg 'd her in with both Hands , and shut the Door . We went to the Watch-house at Dick 's Shore , but none of the Watchmen were there ; and at last we found them at an Alehouse . Prisoner . Did she cry when I took her up ? Horseford . No ; but she groaned twice . Elizabeth Emerson . On Wednesday the 8th of December , about 3 in the Afternoon , I saw the Deceas 'd , and asked her how she did ? O , says she , I shall be murder 'd to Night ! Why so ? says I . Why , says she , the Child has told me that my Husband is gone to eat a Leg o'Mutton and Turnips at Will Perkins 's , and there he 'll get Drunk , and then come Home and Murder me . He had kept Account of my Reckoning from the 11th of March , but now he has moved it to the 11th of April , and wants me to lay my Child to a Man in the Country ; and he said if I would not , he wish 'd the Devil might appear to us both in a great Flame of Fire , and carry him away before my Face if he did not Murder me when he came Home at Night . And so she desir 'd me to leave my Cellar Door open that she might ran in and hide herself when he came ; I told her she should not go in the Cellar , but I would leave my other Doors open , and she should come into my Room and Welcome . And so I did , and I do n't know whether or no she was coming to me , but he met her , and she turn 'd back , and about Midnight , when he came Home I heard him swear , he 'd make her remember leaving the House . He beat her up Stairs , she cry 'd out , O , says my Child , that wicked Man is beating his Wife . I heard something fall into the Street , and then his Door was open 'd . I ran out , and he was dragging her in . O Mr. Hallam , says I , ( clapping my Hands ) take pity of her , for she 's a dead Woman . He made me no Answer . I lean 'd over the Bench at his Door to save her , but he pull 'd her Legs into the Entry , and then threw her down , and said , Dead or Alive , lie there ! and so he shut the Door against me , and bolted it . Many a time have I seen him beat her , and two or three Nights in a Week I have heard her cry out Murder , and have often gone to help her , and got behind him , and held my Arms round his Neck thus - while she has run away for fear of being murder 'd . Sarah Lane , Midwife . On Thursday Morning before Eight , the Prisoner call 'd me to come to his Wife ; I was not quite dress 'd , he desir 'd me to make haste ; he went away , and return 'd in 5 or 6 Minutes to hasten me . She had spoke to me the Friday before to be her Midwife , and I knowing her time was out , thought she was in Labour . But as I came along with him , he told me his Wife had met with a sad Misfortune ; I ask 'd him how ? O Mrs. Lane , says he , she got out of a Window while I was in another Room . When I came there , a Neighbour said she was Dead , and so I found her , for her Face , Hands and Feet were quite cold , but her Body was a little warm . - Another Neighbour came in and asked him how she got up Stairs , and he said she walked up . At Night we stripp 'd her , and I search 'd her Body . There was a great Bruise on her left Arm , and several lesser Bruises on her Back and Sides like Slashes . Her right Hand was cut . The Child was full grown , and black from Head to Foot , especially on the left Side . Prisoner . Did not you bid me send for a Smelling-Bottle , because she was in a Fit ? Lane . Yes ; and I bid you go for a Doctor ; for tho ' I thought she was dead , I was not willing to trust to my own Judgment , because I have no great Skill in the Dead ; but I told you that she did not stir , and in my Opinion never would any more . Sarah Adams . About a quarter past 12 , on Wednesday Night , I happened to be up , and a Neighbour called to me , and said , Hark ! there 's a crying out , our little Neighbour is in Labour ; but presently there was a great Shrick , and Cry of Murder ! So I went and sat at Mrs. Mingo 's Door , which is almost over against the Prisoner 's . The Deceased cry 'd , For Christ 's Sake , do n't murder me ! for God 's Sake ! for my poor Family 's sake , spare me ! - Charles ! Charles ! Charles ! - G - d d - n you for a Bitch , says the Prisoner , what do ye call Charles for ? This was follow 'd by 3 or 4 heavy Blows . The Window was forced open , and she came out , and seemed to catch at the Sign-Post in falling , but miss 'd it , and came to the Ground . She gave dismal Groans . The Prisoner came out in his Shirt , it was speckled Shirt , and with a Candle in his Hand ; and going to lift her up with one Hand , he said , G - d d - n the Bitch , she 's drunk , and has thrown her self out at Window . Then he dragg 'd her in , shut his Door , went up and shut the Casement , and put out his Candle . Prisoner . Was you or Mr. Furnell nearest my Wife when she fell ? Adams . Mr. Furnell and his Friend were coming by before she fell out . I begg 'd 'em for God 's Sake to stop , for here was a Man that would murder his Wife . And one of 'em said , What have we to do between a Man and his Wife ? But for God 's Sake stay , says I , for fear he should kill his 'Prentice too , who is my Sister 's Son . Elizabeth Mingo . I says to my Mother , Lord Mother ! there 's Mr. Hallam a beating his Wife ! I saw her make her first Escape , and saw him come out and haul her in again , but I did not hear what he said then ; but I heard Blows , and heard her shriek , and then heard her lump out of the Window . Joseph Woodward , Surgeon . The Overseers of the Poor desired me to view the Body of the Deceased . Her Arm was bruised , there were 3 or 4 Marks on it , like the Marks made by a Stick , and there was a Wound in the Palm of her Right Hand , above an Inch long , and a quarter of an Inch deep ; it seem 'd to be a Stab with a Knife . I did not take notice of the small Bruises . On Saturday , the Coroner order 'd me to open the Body . - The Abdomen was full of contused Blood , the Womb was rent 7 Inches , and the Infant , which was dead , but full grown , was forced out of the Womb , all but its Feet . The first thing we saw when the Tegament of the Belly was opened , was the Child 's Right Hand ; and I believe the Fall was the Cause of her and the Child 's immediate Death . Mary Thomson . Coming out of my House I heard dismal Groans , and I called out to Mrs. Adams , that there had been a Woman in Labour ; but Elizabeth Mingo cry 'd Murder ! Then I heard the Deceased cry , For God 's Sake , spare my Life ! Do n't murder me to Night , for my poor Childrens Sake ! The Prisoner ran to the Chimney , and took the Tongs or Shovel , as I guess 'd by the Sound , and gave her several Blows . She shriek 'd , and presently she came backwards two-double out of the Window . I heard her groan , and saw the Prisoner come out with a Candle , and drag her in and shut the Door . Ann Brewit , the Deceased 's Mother . The Prisoner brought a Woman to my House to Lye in ; she was a bold Sort of a Woman ; and he said to my Husband , Father , will you let her stay here ? No ; says my Husband . Why then , says the Prisoner , your Daughter shall suffer for it . My Daughter complained to me , that about a Twelve month ago he put a Knife in his Mouth , and threw her upon the Bed , and went to cut her open . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . I do n't doubt but to give the Court full Satisfaction of my Innocency when I have called my Witnesses . Elizabeth Wilkinson . On Wednesday the 8th of December , between 9 and 10 in the Morning , I went to the Prisoner 's House for a Pot of Beer , ( he keeps an Ale-house , the Three Mariners in Rope-maker 's Fields , Limehouse ) and when I came into the Kitchen , his Wife was sitting before the Fire . I stood at a little Distance , I saw she took no notice of me , and so I said , Pray , Mrs. Hallam , what 's the Matter with ye ? She made me no Answer . I ask 'd her again , but still she said nothing ; and at last , says I , Lord ! Mrs. Hallam , what 's the Matter with ye ? Why , says she , I am thinking when the Devil will come for me . Lydia Stevens . About 4 a Clock on Thursday Morning , I was going to wash at a House at Dick 's Shore ( I am a Washer-woman ) and I called at the Prisoner 's House for a Pint of Beer ; he had got a Pot of Water in his Hand , and he said , Have you heard this unhappy Fate ? My Wife has thrown her self out of the Window . I wish you 'd carry up this Water , while I draw your Drink . I went up with the Water , and said , How do you do , Mrs. Hallam ? How happened this ? Why , says she , I ca n't tell very well ; I unfortunately drop 'd my self out of the Window , I feel a Pain in the Bottom of my Belly ; but if I should do otherwise than well , there 's Anderson and Fleming are so hard-mouth 'd , that if my Husband should come to a Tryal , they will swear his Life away ; and therefore I beg you would speak in his Behalf , for he is innocent of throwing me out of the Window . The Window has 3 Lights , the Casement is in the middle , it is about a Yard high from the Floor . Ruth Tate . I and my Aunt went up Ropemaker 's Fields . I heard Betty Wild , a Fish-Woman , cry out Murder ! and Mr. Pidgeon ( who keeps a Brandy-Shop over-against her ) said , What 's the Matter ? and she said , Mrs. Hallam has thrown her self out of the Window . Prisoner . Does not Betty Wild go by the Name of Mingo ? Tate . Yes ; but Wild was her Maiden Name . I saw the Prisoner take the Deceased up under his Arm ( after she fell out o ' Window ) and carry her in , but I did not hear him say any thing . Hannah Radbourne . I saw the Deceased between 10 and 11 , the Morning before she dy 'd . She was sitting on the Settle by the Fire-side , rubbing her Hands , in a very melancholly Mood . What 's the Matter , says I ? Why , says she , the Devil 's got into me , and I believe he will never leave me till I have made away with my self ; I desir 'd her not to have such Thoughts in her Head ; and she said it was no Business of mine , and I need not trouble my Head about it . Mary Carman . I live about a quarter of a Mile from the Deceased 's House ; she came to me on Saturday Fortnight before she dy 'd , and staid till Sunday Night . She shew 'd me her Arm , it was black ; I ask 'd her how it came ? She said her Husband hit her with a Pint-Pot , and she said , Carman ! if any thing should happen to me extraordinary , those People at the next Door will swear my Husband 's Life away . I suppose she did not then think that her End would be so soon . I went to see her about 8 a Clock that Morning she dy 'd , and she was then warm . Andrew Radbourn , ( the Prisoner 's Brother-in-law . ) About 4 a Clock on Thursday Morning , I came up from Limehouse-Hole , thro ' Ropemaker 's Walk ; I saw Lydia Stevens , the Washer-woman , at the Prisoner 's House , and he was coming up Stairs with a pint of Beer in his Hand . I asked how he came to be up so soon ? and he said , his Wife had hove herself out of the Window . I went up , and asked her how it happened ? and she said , she had been disturbed in her Mind the Day before ; and that she was possess 'd with the fear of the Devil , and so she had hove herself out of the Window . And , says she , Fleming and Anderson are so malicious , that they would swear away my Husband 's Life ; but he was not in the Room , nor nigh me , when I did it ; and therefore I desire you would put off your Voyage , and appear for him at his Tryal , which I accordingly did ; for I was going to Sea , but I lost my Voyage on purpose to serve him . I have eat and drank , and lain in the House many a-time , but I never knew any Dispute between them in my Life . Sabina Gibbs . I was going up Ropemakers-Walk , and heard Betty Wild ( her Name is now Mingo ) cry Murder . Mr. Pidgeon , who lives opposite to her , opened his Window , and said , what 's the Matter ! Why , says she , Mrs. Hallam has thrown herself out of the Window . And then I saw the Prisoner come down in his Shirt , and take her up . Thomas Dowty , the Constable . When the Prisoner was taken by the High Constable ( Mr. Betty ) he brought him to my House , and sent me to take an Inventory of his Goods . I ask 'd Charles Bird , the Prisoner 's 'Prentice , [ who was the first Witness ] where he was when his Master and Mistress had Words ? and he said , abed and asleep ; and about 6 o'Clock I heard my Mistress 's Voice , bidding me strike a Light , and draw some Beer , and set it on the Chest . Court . This is no Contradiction to Bird 's Deposition , for he swore that he was asleep when the Quarrel began , but that the Noise waked him . Prisoner . Pray , Mr. Gull , tell my Lord what you have heard Bird say . Nathaniel Gull . On the Saturday after the Prisoner was committed , I heard Charles Bird say , that the Prisoner was not in the Room , but on the Stairs , when his Mistress fell out of the Window . Charles Bird . I do n't know this Gull , I never saw him in my Life before . Gull . What ! Do n't you know me , Child ? Bird . No , not you , Child ! Prisoner . Mr. Benham , pray give the Court an Account of my Character . John Benbam . Your Character ! I know nothing of ye ! George Taylor . I was with Mr. Dowty when he took the Inventory . I heard Charles Bird say , that he was asleep when the Quarrel began betwixt his Master and Mistress ; but I am subpoened by the Prosecutor as well as by the Prisoner , and therefore I will speak the Truth on both Sides . The Prisoner told me and Frank Me riday , that if he could raise 10 Guineas , there was one who would raise Evidences to confront the King 's Evidence , and prove his Wife was Lunatick , and confirm any thing that his own Witnesses would swear to . I asked him how this Accident came about ? he said , I wo n't wrong my Conscience , I believe the Blows I gave her , and my threatening to fetch my Cane , made her throw herself out of the Window . He said , her Hand was cut with the Glass in throwing herself out , and bid me go to the Window and see if the Glass was not bloody . I look 'd , but found no Blood on the Glass nor was it broke , but only crack 'd ; so that it could not cut her Hand . In looking over the Goods , we found in his Waistcoat-pocket a dirty Cap of his Wife 's , which was a little bloody [ Mr. Furnell , in his Deposition above , says , the Deceas 'd had no Cap on , when she fell from the Window . ] Prisoner . I 'll tell your Lordship how that Cap came in my Pocket . My Wife complained of a Pain in her Belly , and desired me to fetch the Midwife , but before you go , says she , pray lend me the Pot , for I want to make Water : So I reached her the Pot , and she try 'd to make Water , but could not . Then she cry 'd , O my Pains ! - Make haste . Jenny , says I , your Cap is very foul , Is it , says she , then take it , and give me a clean Mob out of the Drawer . But as I was pulling out the Drawer , she cry 'd again , O my Belly ! O Robin , make haste - Run for the Midwife ; and so in the hurry I run down Stairs with the Cap in my Hand , and thrust it into my Pocket as I went along . Thomas Doughty , again . The Prisoner told me that the Deceas 'd cut her Hand with the Hook of the Window , but I looked on it , and it was not bloody . James Turner . I was to have taken Charles Bird 'Prentice . I saw him two Days after his Mistress 's Death : He said , that the Day before she dy 'd , when he came to Dinner , she called him Names , he asked her why she did so ? and she said , She did not care what she said , for she must die that Night . William Perkins . On Wednesday , about 10 o ' Clock , I went to the Prisoner 's House , and ask 'd him to go with me to Cock-Hill , which he did , but missing the Person I wanted , I invited him to dine at my House : We had a Mutton-Pye and a Goose for Dinner , and a Half-crown Bowl of Punch betwixt 8 or 9 of us , and each Man had a Pint of Drink besides , which was all the Liquor that was then drank . Some Men were quarreling at my House , and he parted them - I never knew him quarrelsome - He stayed till past Eleven at Night , and then went away , neither drunk nor sober . Thomas Chetwin , Charles Waters , and several other Evidences , appeared in the Prisoner 's Behalf , who all gave him the Character of an honest Man . Prisoner . I can call 20 or 30 more to my Character , but I will give the Court no farther Trouble : I had ten Hours Time to make my Escape , which I should have done , If I had been guilty ; but I rather chose to stay and take Care of my Children ; and I am as innocent of her going out of the Window , as the Child in the Womb . The Jury found the Prisoner guilty of both Indictments , and the Court past Sentence of Death upon him accordingly . 11. John Platt , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for stealing 3 pair of Shoes , the Goods of Samuel Worsly ; 1 pair of Boots , the Goods of William Cary ; and 1 pair of Boots , the Goods of Barnaby Humby , the 5th of this Instant January . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 12. Elizabeth Turner , was indicted for privately stealing 5 Yards of Cambrick , the Goods of Andrew Biggs , in his Shop , the 16th of December last . The Jury found him guilty to the Value of 4s . 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 13. Corbet Vezey , of Stepney , was indicted , for that he not having God before his Eyes , but being moved by a devilish Instigation , and wholly deprived of Humanity and Christian Charity , on the 10th of December , in the 4th Year of his present Majesty , with Malice afore-thought , on Mary his Wife , then being in Peace in the House of Thomas Finlow , in the said Parish , did make an Assault , and against her Will did put , lock up , and detain her in a Garret in the said House , and did not allow her sufficient Meat , Drink , and other Necessaries to sustain Life , and thus continued to keep her till the 16th day of December , in the 5th Year of his said Majesty , by which Means she languished , and languishing lived from the said 10th Day of December , in the 4th Year of the King , till the 30th Day of December , in the 5th Year of the King , and then miserably perished and died : and that so of his Malice afore-thought , he kill 'd and murder 'd the said Mary his Wife . Christopher Best , Beadle . On the 16th of December last , as I was coming by Mr. Finlow 's House ( the Four Swans in Mile-end Town , near the Turnpike ) a Man run a-cross the Road , and said , there 's a Girl upon the House : I looked up and saw two Legs , and presently she fell down upon an old Shed , and so to the Ground : She was stunned with the Fall , and seemed to be lifeless . I took her up , and enquired who she was ; for presently a great many People were got about me , but no Body could answer my Question : Her Body was all black , and her Legs were perfectly covered with a white Mold . She had on a thin old Crape-Gown , and a Bit of a red Petticoat , but no Shift nor Stockings - By-and-by a Woman came out of the Four Swans , took her under her Arm ( for she was light enough ) and carried her in ; I followed , and still enquired who she was , and at last the Prisoner came , and said it was his Wife . And are you not asham 'd to keep your Wife so ? says I , she looks as if she was starved , she 's nothing but Skin and Bone ! No , no , says he , she 's not starved . Some of the Company gave the poor Woman a Dram , and she began to come to herself . I desired she might be put to Bed , and taken care of : She was carry 'd up Stairs , I would have followed directly , but they refused to let me , for they said they must put her on a clean Shift . Sometime after this , some Women went up , and I followed them into the Garret ; and then she had got a Shift on . There was a half-peck Loaf wrap 'd in a Cloth , and hanging up by a String : It was very hard and mouldy . I asked , why it was hung there ? and somebody answered , to keep it from the Mice . The Deceas 'd being pretty well come to herself , said to me , For God 's Sake stay by me ! I have been used barbarously ! I am starved to Death ! I stay 'd with her about half an Hour , and came again next Day . The Lock and Key of her Door were without side : I asked the Reason of it , and was told by the Woman of the House , that it was to lock the Deceas 'd up . I found several Bits of hard Cheese lying about the Garret . The Deceas 'd said , Those Bits of Cheese are laid for me , and I would eat them if I could , but in the weak Condition I am in , I might as well try to eat a Piece of Board . When they brought me up any Victuals , they used to leave it just within the Door , and if I could not get out of Bed to fetch it , I might lie and starve : And once I made shift to crawl to the Door , but was not able to get back again ; so that I was forced to lie there in the Cold all Night ; and they let me have none but cold hard Victuals , such I can seldom eat , and cold Small Beer . I have begg 'd many a time for a little Water-gruel , but all in vain . They would not so much as let me have a little Fire , or a bit of Candle , or Sheets to my Bed , tho ' they knew I was ready to perish with Cold , so that for want of these and other Necessaries my very Skin has peel 'd off . And so saying , she shew 'd me a Paper in which she had put some of the bits of her Skin as they peel 'd off . They were all white and mouldy , and look 'd just like her Legs which were cover 'd over with a white Mold . Her Flesh was all over wasted , and black where it was not mouldy . - Her Flesh did I say ? No ; I mean her Skin , for I saw no sign of any Flesh that she had . I asked her why she did not cry out for help ? and she said she had done so , and that thereupon the Prisoner came up and Horse-whipp 'd her , and threatened that he would murder her if it was not for the Law . She lived 10 or 11 Days after this . I went to see her every Day . She spit Blood the first Day , and was all along very feeble , and complain 'd of a Weakness inwardly . She said she was 55 or 56 Years of Age . Coroner . Did she tell you why she got upon the House ? Best . Yes : She said she did it thro ' Necessity , as thinking it better to make an end of her Life in that manner , than to starve to Death . Court . You say her Body was black , might not that Blackness come by the Fall ? Best . I believe not , for her Body was all over black , she was stunn 'd with the fall , but recover 'd in about a Quarter of an Hour , and I did not perceive that she had received any further Hurt , for she was so wasted away , that she fell very light , and then her fall was broke by an old Shed . Court . Do you think she could not eat the Cheese ! was it so hard as not to be eatable ? Best . Perhaps hail Man might eat it ; but I believe that a Woman in her weak Condition could not . Court . Did she say why he us 'd her thus ? Best . She said , It was because she refus 'd to sell a small Estate . Court . How long had she been confin 'd thus ? Best . She said a Year and a half . Court . Did she give you this Account more than once ? Best . Yes , several times . Court . And did she never vary in her account ? Best . No , not in the least Circumstance . She repeated the very same Things from the first time to the last . Court . Do you think she was in her right . Senses ? Best . Yes , without doubt , she was examin 'd before Justice Leake . Court . Is her Examination here ? Clerk of the Arraigns . Yes , my Lord ; here it is . Court . Who proves it ? Richard Dun . I , my Lord ; I was present when the Deceas 'd was examin 'd before Mr. Justice Leake . It was on the 17th of Dec. last . Court . Look on it ; Is that her Hand ? Did you see her sign it ? Dun . I did , my Lord . Court . Was it read over to her before she sign 'd it ? Dun . It was , my Lord . Court . Was she in her full Senses when this Examination was taken , and did she seem to consider herself as a dying Woman ? Dun . I thought so , my Lord . Court . Let the Examination be read . Clerk , Reads . Middlesex , ss . The Examination of Mary Vezey , Wife of Corbet Vezey , now of Mile-End old Town , Weaver , taken on her Oath before me Stephen Martin Leake Esq ; One of his Majesty 's Justices of the Peace for the said Country , the 17th Day of December 1731. Who faith , That she came from Christ-Church Hospital about the Month of April 1730 . ( when she was almost recover 'd of a Fever and Learnness she had ) to her said Husband Corbet Vezey , at his Lodgings at the Sign of the Four Swans in Mile-End Old Town aforesaid : At which time he put her in a Garret in the said House , and put a Lock on the outside of the Door thereof , and confin 'd her till November following , about which time she obtained leave of her said Husband to go out and beg a Shift , and about a Week 's time she return 'd , and her said Husband then put her in the said Garret , and confin 'd her to the 16th Instant , and kept her during that time chiefly with cold Meat , and sometimes with dry and mouldy Bread , and cold Small Beer , which she by reason of her Indisposition could not eat , putting it sometimes just within side the Door , which she was obliged to croep on her Hands and Knees to fetch , and bad neither Candle nor Fire all the time , which she often complaining of , and desiring him often to send her hot Victuals , good Bread , warm Beer , or some Water-Gruel , which he always refused ; and desired him to let her have a Minister , which he likewise refused ; and has several times threatened her , that he would kill her , if it was not for the Laws of the Land . And that he used her as above partly upon Account of her refusing to sell a small Estate she had , and his keeping another Woman Company . And that she lately offer 'd to call out at the Window to the Neighbours for Relief , and her said Husband then whipped her with a Horse-whip . And the 16th of this Instant December , in the Evening , after her said Husband brought her up some Bread , and she desiring him to bring her some Water-gruel , which he refused , and she being almost starved and tired of her Life with the above Treatment , got out of a Window of the Said Garret , and tumbled down into the Highway , to make an end thereof . Jur . cor . me 17 die Decembri Anno Domini 1731 . Steph . Martin Leake . The Mark of + Mary Vezey . Philip Betty , High-Constable . On the 17th of December , by Justice Leake 's Order , I went to enquire about this Affair . I found the Prisoner in his Loom , and I ask 'd him , Why he us 'd his Wife in such a Manner ? He took me up shortly , and said , He 'd never use her better . Upon this I secur 'd him , and went to his Wife , who gave me the self same Account , as she did to the Justice upon her Examination . I was present when she sign 'd that Examination , and she then seem 'd to have some Thoughts of Death ; but so perfectly in her Senses , that if the Clerk mistook but a Word in his rough Draught , she always observ 'd it , and desir 'd it might be corrected ; and she repeated it 2 or 3 times , that her Husband refus 'd her Water-gruel that Day , and therefore she thought to end her Life by getting out of Window . Sarah Brees . I went to see the Deceas 'd the Morning after she got out of the Window . I found her a Bed , very weak and sore , full of Pain , and in a sad Condition . She was a mere Skeleton to look at , her Body was as black as Wainscot , and there was nothing but Skin over her Bones . She told me she was starv 'd for want of Necessaries , and had neither Fire nor Candle , and that he often swore he 'd murder her if it was not for the Law . I ask 'd her , why she got out of the Window ? She said , she thought to make an end of a miserable Life , for she had undergone so much , that she was not able to bear it any longer ; that she first attempted to cut her Throat , but the Knife she had was so dull , that she thought it would rather add to her Pain than release her from it . Afterwards she thought to Hang herself , and at another time to strangle herself in the Bed , but at last resolv 'd to throw herself from the Garret Window . She told me the same Story several times ; the last time I saw her was 3 or 4 Days before her Death . I had no Acquaintance with her before this , when the Prisoner asked me to go up and see her ; I said I did not know her , why then , says he , if you do n't know her , nor she know you , she 'll owe you the less Discourse . He was carried to Prison that Night . I believe she did not die by the fall , but was starved to Death . James Badily . Justice Leake sent me Word of what had happened to the Deceas 'd , she being a Relation of mine . I went to see her next Day , and found her a Bed in the Garret . She was very weak and low , and almost wasted away to nothing but Skin and Bones , I enquir 'd why she got out of the Window ; she answer 'd 't was to release herself from her Misery and Consinement , and added , that she had been kept there about 18 Months , except a little time ( Once ) when she was out ; that she had neither Fire nor Candle , nor the common Necessaries of Life to subsist ; that she was kept with mouldy Bread , hard Crust of Cheese , and Small Beer , and sometimes Meat , but all Cold ; that they always set it for her on the Ground , just within her Door , and if she could scramble out of Bed for it she might ; and that sometimes she was so Cold that she could not get the Victuals to her Month , but has been forced to let it drop out of her Fingers again ; and that she did not dare to call for help , because he threatened to beat her : Her Skin was quite discolour 'd , and she look 'd like an Anatomy . I visited her 3 or 4 times before her Death , she was in her Senses all along , and never varied in the Accounts she gave me of the ill Usage she receiv 'd from her Husband . About 2 Months before this happen 'd , I met the Prisoner 's Father in White-Chapel , and asked him , where my Kinswoman ( the Deceas 'd ) was ? He answer 'd , with her Husband . And do they agree any better , says I ? Why , says he , I believe she wants for nothing . I told him I was glad of it , for I had heard otherwise before , and that when she went into the Hospital he would allow her nothing , for though he was but a Journeyman Weaver , yet he must have had some Money , because he took in Pawns . Court . Did she want for Victuals ? J. Badily . She had no such Victuals as was fit for a Person in her Case to eat , and then the Room was in such a Condition with her own Nastiness ( for she had not Necessaries to case herself , and to keep herself clean , ) that the scent of it was very noisome to her . Court . Did she receive any Hurt by the fall ? J. Badily . She told me she thought she had not , and I did not find that she was bruised . Prisoner . What did you say to me when I was in New-Prison ? J. Badily . The Prisoner talk 'd of coming to an Agreement with me . She had a small Estate of about 7 or 8 l. a Year , and he offer 'd that that should be made over to me if she would consent , and that he would allow me 3s . a Week more to maintain her ; but this was after he was taken up . Anne Badily . I went to the Deceased after her Fall , and found her in a very weak and lamentable Condition . She shew 'd me her Legs and Breast ; she was nothing but Skin and Bones ; her Skin was all black , and she look 'd just like an Anatomy that I have seen at a Surgeon 's . She told me she got out of Window to rid her self of a miserable Life . I asked why she did not send word to me , or some of her Neighbours , to come and help her ? She said she had no Body to send , and if she knock 'd or call 'd for Help , the Prisoner would come up and horse-whip her . There was a Half-Peck Loaf hung up in her Room , but it was dry and mouldy ; and several odd bits of Cheese lay about on the Ground , but she said her Stomach was so bad that she could not eat any of it . O Conson , said she , no Tongue can express , nor Heart conceive , the deplorable Miseries that I have felt ! I have been lock 'd up in this Room for a Year and a half , perishing with Hunger and Cold , and in want of the common Necessaries of Life . In the Extremity of Winter , without Candle ! without Fire ! without Conveniences to ease my self ! without Water to keep me clean , or Covering that would keep me Warm ! continually languishing , unable to help my self , and yet without a Friend to help me ! to comfort me ! to pity me ! In this Condition , tho ' I have hardly had Strength to get out of my Bed , my Victuals , cold ! and hard ! and mouldy ! has been brought but just within my Door , and there left upon the Ground , by the Creature that keeps Company with my Husband . I have been forced to crawl thither on my Hands and Knees , and when I have got to it , my Fingers have been so benunim 'd with Cold , that I have not been able to lift it to my Head , but have been necessitated to take it up from the Ground with my Mouth , and then it was seldom that I could eat it ! And sometimes I have been unable to creep back to my Bed again , so that I have been obliged to lie at the Door all Night , in the midst of Winter ! Many a time I have begg 'd for God 's sake for a little warm Beer ; and once , and but once , it was brought me . I had no better Place to case my self in that the Chimney , and there it used to be piled up together , so that not being able to bear the Smell , I have often been forced to lie with my Nose under the Pillow . Once I threw a little Water ( which I had in a broken Pan ) out of Window ; for which he came up and horse me . O ! Mr. Vezey , said I , you can ease your self where you please ! you do n't know what it is to want such Conveniences , sure if you did you would never use me thus ! He damn 'd me for an old stinking Bitch , and swore if it was not for the Law he would murder me ; and so went away again . You see , Consin , how my Hair is matted together ; he will not allow me so much as a Comb . I am almost devour 'd with Vermin , they have eat Holes in my Head . My Hair was so troublesome to me that I have taken a great deal of Pains to cut some of it off with an old rusty Knife . My own Filthiness has been intolerable to me . This , and much more , more than I can speak , I have suffer 'd ; because I was not willing to part with that little Estate of mine . After the Deceased had given me this Account , I desired her to consider with her self that she was a dying Woman , and therefore ought to be very careful that she spoke nothing but the Truth . Consin , said she again I have told you the Truth , and nothing but Truth ; I have suffer 'd more than I can tell you and yet I never called him any thing worse than Mr. Vezey . When I wanted any thing with him , I always said , Mr. Vezy , pray let me speak with you ; and his common Answer was , Damn you , for a Bitch ; if it was not for the Law I would murder you . Court . Was not the Fall the Cause of her Death ? A. Badily . I ask 'd her that Question , and she answer 'd , No ; I felt no Hurt whatever by the Fall , but I feel an inward Sinking and Decay , for want of the common Necessaries of Life ; and I assure you , Consin , on the Word of a dying Person , that I am starved to Death ; for tho ' I had some Victuals , it was such that in my weak Condition I could not sufficiently eat of to support Nature . And she begg 'd of me to get a Minister ; and I have since been very sorry that I did not do it at that time , but I did not then think she was so near her End . When I went into her Room ( tho ' it had been clean 'd out but a little before ) the Scent of it was so offensive that I could hardly bear it . She offer 'd to kiss me , but she was in such a sad Condition , and smelt so strong , that I was obliged to decline it . The Creature that belong 'd to the House was almost constantly with her , to hear what she said , and to keep her from speaking , as much as she could . As for the Prisoner , I know little of him , and never had any Conversation with him . Whenever I talk 'd with the Deceased on this Occasion , she constantly gave me the same Account , and never varied in the Circumstances of any one thing that she repeated . Thomas Panter . I am a Watchman in Mile-End Old Town , and was with Mr. Betty the High Constable when he went to take the Prisoner : and I then heard the Prisoner say that he had been out the Sunday before , and staid beyond Dinner-time , and that when he came home , the People of his House told him that his Wife had been meaning for her Dinner . Upon which he went up and horse-whip 'd her ; and , says he , that has put her in such a Fit of the Sullens , that she wo n't eat these 10 Days . Prisoner . I have not horse-whip 'd her these four Years . Matthew Davis . While the Prisoner was in Custody , he said , that he had been to take a Walk the Sunday before , and staid longer than ordinary , so that the Dinner was later than usual ; and when he came home , the People of the House told him , that the Deceased had call 'd for Victuals ; and he own 'd , that upon that he went up and horse-whip 'd her ; and he said , that ever since she had got a Fit of the Sullens , and would not eat her Victuals . Mary Renshaw . I was near the Deceased when she fell from the House ; I asked who she was , but no Body answer 'd . A Woman came out of the Four Swans , and carried her in . I went to see her the Sunday following , she told me they gave her nothing but dry Bread and hard Cheese , and sometimes cold Meat , and cold Small-Beer . That she had often begg 'd for Christ 's sake for a little warm Small Beer , but could never get it but Once . That they set the Victuals on the Ground just within the Door , and that sometimes she was so weak that she could not get to it . She was very sensible . She told me she was born the Year after the Fire of London . She took me by the Hand , and thank 'd me for coming to see her . Richard Harrison , Brother to the Deceased . Last November was a Twelvemonth , I found my Sister ( the Deceased ) in Forestreet , begging a Dish of Broth . I took her home with me , and kept her about a Fortnight ; but being a poor labouring Man , I could not afford to maintain her any longer , and she being willing to go home again , I went with her to her Husband , and as soon as ever she came in he turn 'd her up Stairs , and said , Get up , you damn 'd Bitch , to your Room , and there you shall starve , and never come out till you are brought out on four Mens Shoulders . I went to see her sometimes on a Sunday ; for as I was a working Man I could not spare time to go any other Day . She had no Shoes on her Bed , and was full of Vermin . When the Prisoner was at home he used to go up with me , but when he was abroad I could not get in , for he commonly took the Key with him . I offer 'd to take her home , if he would allow me for her Maintenance , and take my Bond that she should not be sent home to him again ; but he would not take my single Bond , and I could get no Body to be bound with me . Court . 'T is very strange that you should know your Sister was treated in this manner , and not complain to a Magistrate . Harrison . Why , I did speak of it to some People , and they told me that no Body could hinder him from locking his Wife up if he had a mind to it , for she was his Goods , and he might do what he would with her ; and I was a poor Man , and could not afford to go to Law . Court . What Reason did he give for using her thus ? Harrison . Because she would not part with a small Matter in the Country ; and he told me , if she would but do that he would make her a happy Woman . Court . Did you never sollicite him to let her have her Liberty ? Harrison . Yes ; I talk 'd with him about it the latter End of the Summer , and he told me , if I 'd take her home he 'd allow me 18 Pence a Week ; but I said she was then so weak that I cou 'd not get her home . Prisoner . At the Man-in-the-Moon Tavern in White-Chapel , I offered to settle the Estate upon him and his Brother , and allow him 2 s. a Week to keep her . Mr. Martin the Attorney was there at the same time . Harrison . Yes , he did so ; but that was the Year the King was crown 'd , and the Attorney said I must give Security to maintain her ; and I said I could give none : And as for the Estate he talks of , that was seiz 'd by my Brother , and I had no Money to go to Law about it . Prisoner . One Day when Richard Harrison went up with me to see my Wife , he said he would rather live in a Jail than live as she did . Says I , You talk as if you did not know what a Jail is . Why , says he , here 's Victuals and Drink indeed , but in a Jail I should have Company . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . When I first married this Wife I was a Journeyman Weaver , and I took the Man-in-the-Moon Ale-house in Skinners Street ; and no Couple could live more lovingly , for she was as good a temper 'd Woman as ever trod Shoe of Leather . But she begun to wrong me in my Alehouse , so that I have miss 'd a Guinea at a time ; and she would take my Linen away and carry it out of Doors ; and tho ' I was a good Husband , and very careful and sparing , yet I found I was run out above 60 Pounds , for I was a 100 and odd Pounds in debt , and had but 30 Pounds to pay it with , and I was hard press 'd for Money , and wept bitterly ; and yet I could not believe my own Eyes , for she had got such a fair deluding Tongue , that I loved her as I loved my Life . And she took this Linen - Mrs. Badily . It was none of your Linen . Prisoner . She took this Linen , and a matter of 19 Pounds in Money and Rings , and a Counterpain and other Things , and put them all in a Trunk , and sent them to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel ; but as God would have it , I got Intelligence , and fetch 'd them all back again . Then I open 'd the Trunk , and look 'd over the Goods , and told the Money , and said , Mary , I desire that you would not carry my Things out at this rate , but let my own House hold my own , and if we can get Money let us keep it , there they are all again ! do so no more ; She cry 'd sadly , and said , She did it for fear they should be seiz 'd , and desir 'd me to give her the 3 Rings , which I did to make her easy , and when she got them she said , This is for such a One , and this for such a One , and this for such a One ; Zounds ! Says I , yes , my Lord , I did say Zounds , that I did , Zounds ! Says I , and which is for me ? Then she cry 'd again sadly for a Broad-Piece , which was my former Wife 's , and I told her , If she cry 'd her Heart out she should never have it ; but if she had a mind to look at it now and then she should and welcome . At another time I look 'd under the Bed , and pull 'd out a Handkerchief , and there was 25 s. in Half-pence , all but 2 naughty Farthings , and under the Drawers I found another with 17 l. in Silver in it ; this was 13 Months after we were married . Then she lent 30. in my Name to one Mackey , and she has I believe a great many Things out that I shall never hear of , and that 's the Reason that I confin 'd her . She had me Arrested by Mr. Badily ; she left my House , and I put her in the Postman to invite her Home , and once I gave half a Guinea only for the Sight of her , and then I could not have her away . After this she came again , and said , she was come to live with me ; and I said , Mary , come and welcome , if so be you will live honestly , and not rob me ; she made many fair Promises , and I believ 'd her again . I would have set her up in a little Brandy-Shop , in Bell-Yard , but she did not like the House : Then she pilfer 'd from me again ; if I had but a Farthing's-worth of Oatmeal , she would steal some of it , and hide it . I verily believe , that at times , she has robb 'd me of above a Quart of Oatmeal in this manner , and then she would steal my Butter , and Pudding , and Soap , and the Lord knows how many Things . and hide them upon the Bed's-Teaster , as if that was a Place to put Victuals in . But she would be doing , God knows , tho ' it was but a little . Joseph Avery . I never knew but that the Prisoner behav 'd himself well to his former Wife , and to this too , when they first went to live in Skinner's-Street . He told me of a Trunk , which , as he said , this Wife had carry 'd out , and desir 'd me , as I was Constable , to assist him in getting it again ; we went to the Three Goats-Heads in White-Chapel , and it was readily delivered to us upon demand , and it was sent home again ; I do n't know who carried it out , but this Wife of his had a very bad Name . Elizabeth Finlow . I keep the Four Swans at Mile-End ; my Father rents the House , but he 's very Antient , and I have the Management of every thing .

This Creature would not go out of the Room all the while I was there , on purpose to hear what the Deceas 'd said to me . E. F. It is no such thing . Thomas Finlow , Father to the last Witness . Every Day we din 'd I saw them take a Plate of such Victuals as we had for Dinner , Meat , Pudding , or Dumplin ( hot or cold as it happened ) and carry it up Stairs ; and I saw them bring down the empty plate ; I am sure there was every time 3 times as much as I can eat , and enough for any reasonable Man : And every Day they carried up 2 Bottles of Beer . Court . Are you sure the Deceas 'd had all this ? Thomas Finlow . I know nothing of that , I am a feeble old Man , I never was up in her Room in my Life , and I never saw the Deceas 'd but that once when her Brother brought her Home , and then she was very thin and poor . Ann Crew [ Drew ] a Washerwoman . When I have been washing at Finlow 's House , I have seen them carry up Plates of Victuals , such as they had themselves for Dinner , and as much as I could eat , and seen them bring the empty Plates down again . I have been up in her Room 4 Times . The first Time I went up , she complained for Beer , and said , she was almost parched up with Drought . I told the Prisoner of it , and he took no Notice of it at first , but I speaking to him again , he made me go up , and then Mrs. Finlow was there , and shewed me 4 or 5 Bottles of Beer . I asked the Deceas 'd why she complained for Drink when she had so much ? she said , She let it stand there because she lov 'd to have it stale , and to drink it one under another . Court . Did you see those Bottles when you first went up ? Crew . No ; I was not in the Room then , for he was gone out , and had the Key with him : She spoke to me through the Door . The next Time I went up , I swept the Room , and made the Bed . Court . What kind of Bedding had she ? Crew . There was 1 Sheet , 3 Blankets , and a Counterpain ; they were good tidy Blankets , fit for a poor Body 's Bed . I washed her Shifts . Court . How often ? Crew . As often as she soul 'd them . Court . That 's not the Question . How often have you washed them ? Crew . Why , my Lord , she would not always soul them : She said , she would not wear them out , because she was willing to keep them to go into the Hospital ; and so she cut the Sheets , and pinned the Pieces about her instead of a Shift . Court . You will not answer the Question . Crew . I have washed 2 Shirts . Court . Did you wash any Sheets for her ? every Month , or two Months . Crew . I can not say how often ; but I have washed Sheets . She had 9 Caps . Court . And how often have you washed Caps for her ? Crew . As often as she soul 'd them ; but she would not soul them . Court . When you went up , how did you get in ? Crew . With other Company ; my Mistress let me in : But the last Time the Key was in the Door , and I got in myself , and carried her up a Couple of Eggs and a Rosher of Bacon ; and she said , Very well . This was about 9 or 10 Weeks before she died . Court . What Conveniencies had she ? Crew . A Chamber-pot , and a Pan to spit in . I swept the Room after she fell down ; I never saw any Ordure about the Room , nor any Nastiness in it but Dust . This is one of her Aprons - and this one of her Handkerchiefs - The Deceas 'd gave them me for laying her out . She had 18 Handkerchiefs , 2 colour 'd Aprons , and 1 Muslin Apron ; they were in a Trunk in her Garret , and I did not see that the Trunk was lock 'd . I never saw her out of Bed but once , and then I peeped through the Key-hole , and she was standing on the Floor . Benjamin Vezey , the Prisoner 's Brother . I frequented the House where my Brother lived , and dined there 2 or 3 Times a Week . Elizabeth Finlow is my Wife 's Sister . As soon as the Victuals was taken off of the Spit , or out of the Pot , whether it was Fish , Flesh , or Fowl , a Plate of the same was carried up for the Deceas 'd , and it was more than I could eat . Court . Did you see the Meat given to her ? Vezey . I never was up but once , and that was 5 Months ago . Court . And what had you for Dinner then ? Vezey . A Goose roasted , a Giblet-Pye , and 2 Rabbits . Court . That was very well indeed , considering your Sister boarded both a Man and his Wife for 7 s. a Week . Vezey . And my Sister carried a Plate full , heaped . Court . Are you sure it was given to the Deceas 'd ? Vezey . I do n't know that ; but after Dinner I carried up a Dram of Brandy , and she drank it , and made no complaints to me . Court . Do you know why she was confin 'd ? Vezey . To tell you the Truth , my Brother said , that if she came down , nothing would be too hot nor too heavy for her , she was so given to pilFering . Court . What condition was the Room in ? Vezey . Very clean , handsome and decent . She ask 'd me why I did not come and see her oftener ? I had lodg 'd in the same Room my self before she came . Prisoner . What did she say to you after she fell off of the House ? Vezey . Sister , says I , how do you do ? I do n't know ye , says she . What ! says I , do n't you know your Brother Ben ? O ! says she , is it you ? What a Mercy it was , Brother , that I did not hurt myself with the Fall ? Ay , Sister , said I , so it was ; but you have hurt your Husband , for he is got into Prison about it . Ay , says she , and seemed very much surprized . Elizabeth Hawtrey . I have been divers Times in the Room , and always - almost - found the Key in the Door . I eat and drank with her sometimes . I have clean 'd her Room , made her Bed , washed her and shifted her ; she had tolerable good Shifts ; and a Month afterwards , which was the Morning she got out of the Window , I found her without a Shift ; says I , why do you go so ? Because , says she , I ca n't bear a Shift . I have eat and drank with her many and many a Time , and have carried her up , Fish , Flesh , and Fowl , hot , and sat by her Bed-side while she eat it . She had a very good Stomach , and eat heartily , till latterly . I went up with Dr. Scurry , when he came to see her : He asked her how she did ? and said , it is a Mercy that you got no more Hurt when you fell out of the Window ; and she answer 'd , I know nothing of it . About 3 Months before her Fall , I would have taken her to keep at my House , and her Husband offered to give me 3 s. a Week , but she would not consent , and said , she would stay where she was . About a Year before her Fall , she went out , and said , she would go to her Kinsman , who owed her 100l . she staid a Fortnight , and then her Brother brought her home , and a Porter came with them with a Bundle . Her Brother desired the Prisoner to pay the Porter for bringing the Bundle , but he refus 'd till he saw what it was , and when it was opened , it was nothing but a Bundle of Rags . Corbet Vezey , the Prisoner 's Father . I have seen the Prisoner carry up hot Victuals from Dinner several times , both roast and boil 'd ; I have desired her to let me know if she wanted any thing , but she made no Complaint , and her Husband was not then with me . I have carry 'd her up Victuals myself , since she fell off the House . She was lock 'd up for robbing him , and carrying away his Trunk ; and other Things . William Parker . I often din 'd at the House , and always the Prisoner , or Elizabeth Finlow , carry 'd up a Place of Victuals , the same as we eat , and came down again without the Plate . I called one Sunday , and Elizabeth Finlow said to the Prisoner , Mr. Vezey , your Wife desires to see Mr. Parker . Did she ? says the Prisoner , then he shall go up . I went up and found a Plate of Victuals ; it was part of a Fillet of Veal , and boiled Bag Plumb-pudding . Says she , I think what I eat turns to Phlegm . Says I , can you eat any of this ? What is it , says she ? I ha n't look 'd on it yet . 'T is Veal and Pudding , says I ; then give it me , says she ; and so she eat the Pudding , but says she , I do n't care for the Meat now , set it down . Do you want any thing , says I ? No , says she , only I forgot to ask Mr. Finlow to spit in . I told Mrs. Finlow of it , and she she 'd go to Town on the Morrow , and buy some thing fit for that Use . This was about 5 Months , ago . I afterwards called on a Worky-day the Prisoner was gone to Bromley , and Mrs. Finlow was frying a couple of Mutton-chops ; is that your Father 's Dinner , says I ? No , Father 's gone out , 't is for Mr. Vezey ; for Dinner fell short to Day ; and then I saw her carry it up Stairs . Ann Vezey , the Prisoner 's Sister-in-law . I have din 'd at my Brother-in-law 's 2 or 3 Times Week and saw both him and my Sister Finlow carry up such Victuals as they eat themselves : I have been in her Room , and seen her eat till she left off , and have seen 3 or 4 Bottles of Beer there at a time Three Days after she fell off the House , I asked her , what Reason she had for doing so ? she said , she could not tell , but she was sorry that she had done it . Says I , did you want any thing ? No . never , says she , I always had both roast and boil 'd And when I told her of her Husband , she said , she did not know that she had said any thing against him . And indeed I never knew her make any Complaint . Sarah Skelton . I often dined at the House , and saw hot Victuals and warm Ale carried up several Times , and particularly one Time Mrs. Finlow carried up Veal and Bacon , and Greens , and I went up with her , and saw the Deceas 'd eat it ; and she had on a clean Shift and Mob , and very clean Sheets , and a good Bed . This was a Month before she got out of the Window . I have been up several Times , and seen a Bottle of Beer stand in the Chair by her Bed-side . Edward Hawtrey . I was there on the 21st of December , when Dr. Scurry went up ; I lighted him up Stairs ; the Room was not noisome ; she had on a black and white Crape-Gown , a Shift and a Cap . He said , How do you do ? she answered Indifferent , but should be better if I could see my Husband ; for I know not what I have done , that Justice Leake should send him to Prison . And the Doctor said , No-body can release him but you ; for it is the common Vogue that he has starved you . No , says she , I would not have you believe any such Thing , for I had hot Meat , both roast and boil 'd , every Day , or every other Day , as good as any Body could desire to eat . Mr. Dawson ask 'd her , if her Husband hung up the half-peck Loaf by a String ? and she said , No ; I did it myself to keep the Mice from eating it . I have often seen hot Meat , both roast and boil 'd , Fowls , and other Victuals sent up . Henry Dawson , Collector of the Tax at Mile-end . I went up with Dr. Scurry , only he and I , I told her , there was a Report that her Husband had tied a Loaf up out of her Reach ; she said , No , she hung it there herself to keep it from the Mice . She said , she should be glad if her Husband was out of Prison ; but I heard her say nothing about her Information before the Justice . Solomon Turkey . About 2 o'Clock in the Afternoon , on Sunday the 19th of December , I went up , and asked how she did ? she said , very well , considering her late Misfortune . Says I , why did you get upon the House ? and she answered , Sir , I desire you to ask no Questions ; for if I was to relate to you all the Actions of my Life , it would fill a Book that the World could not contain ; but all my Trouble is , that my Husband is in Trouble , and if I could but see him out , I did not care if the Lord would take me out of the World the next Moment . You seem to be much concerned at his Trouble , says I , but he would have had some , if you had made yourself away . No , says she , it would only have been the Char ge of paying the Coroner and Jury . But she said nothing that she had informed against him . Robert Osborn [ Osmond ] . I asked her if it was true that her Husband had starv 'd her ? she said , No , she had Bread and Cheese enough , and more than she could eat , and Meat 3 Times a Week . I asked her why her Husband confined her ? she said , there were Faults on both Sides : She heartily forgave him , and hoped God would forgive her . James Thurgill . I was the Prisoner 's Apprentice , and during my Time he kept a good House , with Fish , Flesh , and Fowl , and that was very well , you 'll say , for a working Man . His first Wife died 3 Days after my Time was out ; when he married the Deceas 'd he moved into Skinner-street , and they lived very happily at first , till he found Embezzlements , and then they begun to differ , and have Words . He had Information of a Trunk being carried away , which he got again . They were very much unsettled , he found more Embezzlements , and at last lock 'd her up , to hinder her from taking his Money . After she got out of the Window , I heard he was apprehended for starving her , and went to her on the 18th of December : I asked her how she did , and if she had wanted ? she answer 'd , No . I told her , I had heard him say that he had cut for her before he cut himself , and she said so he had . On the 26th of December I went again , and ask 'd her if the Bread was tied up by her or him ? she said , She tied it up herself to keep it from the Mice , and that she was sorry he was in Jail . But I heard her say nothing about her Information . Mary Hawtrey . I went up after her Fall , and asked her how she did ? she said , I thank God , indifferently , considering my Misfortune . How do you sleep ? says I , Very well , says she , but only I sometimes wake in a Fright with the Trouble about my Husband , since he has been in Prison ; but I do n't know what I have said to the Justice , that he has taken him out of the House , any more than the Child unborn . While I was there , Mr. Badily came up , and asked her how she did ? and she said , She did not know him . No ! says he , why , I am your Cousin Badily ; they say you have been starved . No , says she , it is no such thing , and I beg that you would not believe their Lies ; for I had the best of Butchers Meat , both roast and boil 'd , and Bread and Cheese , and small Beer ; but only within this Fortnight my Stomach would not bear it . Mr. Badily . I do n't remember that this Mary Hawtrey was there when I was , but I am certain the Deceas 'd said no such thing , but quite the reverse in every Respect ; for she told me , she had no such Victuals as she could eat , or that was fit for any Person in her Condition ; and that she wanted the common Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life . Mary Hawtrey , and Mrs. Dunbar took hold of the Deceas'd 's Hand , and said , You look better than when you came out of the Hospital . Yes , said she , I am better except my Fall . Mr. Badily . There was no such thing spoke in my hearing . A Juryman . Pray , my Lord , ask Elizabeth Finlow , if she was present when the Deceas 'd was examin 'd before the Justice . Elizabeth Finlow . No . Ann Clark . When Dr. Scurry was there , he ask 'd her why she throw 'd herself off of the House ? and she said , She knew not why : And he said , it was a barbarous Action , and Self-Murder . And somebody ask 'd if she was in her Senses ? and she said , Sometimes she was , and sometimes not . Then the Doctor ask 'd her about the Loaf , and she told him , she hung it there herself to keep the Mice from it . Mr. Scurry . Surgeon . I never ask 'd her why she throw 'd herself off of the House ; Mr. Dawson and I indeed enquir 'd about the Loaf , and she said she ty 'd it up her self , to keep the Mice from it . I went to see her the Day after her Fall , and found no Contusion or Fracture , or any thing like it . She had a Difficulty of breathing , and a Cough , attended with a great Spitting , an ill Habit of Body , was very weak and asthmatic , and prodigiously emaciated . I order 'd her Panada , and such kind of thin Diet . When I open 'd her , I perceiv 'd no inward Contusion , nor extravasated Blood . Upon opening the Thorax I found her Lungs much decay 'd , and an Adhesion on the Left Side . 'T is frequent to find an Adhesion , a Decay of the Lungs , and a general Waste , in Consumptions , for these are the common Symptoms . Court . Do you think you should have found such Symptoms in a consumptive Person who had lived well , and wanted no Necessaries ? Mr. Scurry . Yes . Mr. Coldkam ; Surgeon . I saw the Body of the Deceas 'd open 'd ; her Lungs were wasted and decay 'd , and adher 'd to the Left Side . I believe she dy 'd of an Asthma and Consumption . Court . If she had not been consumptive , but by being kept from the Air , and wanting proper Aliment had only been starved , would that have had the same Effect upon her Lungs ? Mr. Coldham . No , I believe not ; tho ' I never examin 'd the Body of a Person that dy 'd for Want . The Lungs might be entire , for tho ' the Body is emaciated , it does not follow that the Intestines must be corrupted . Mr. Mackenny , Surgeon . I examin 'd the Body with Mr. Scurry , and his Opinion agreed with mine , that she dy 'd of an Asthama . Mr. Scurry . I had heard the Report of her being starved , and asked her if it was true , she said she had Victuals , but complain 'd of her Consinement . Richard Chamberlain . I have known the Prisoner 7 or 8 Years , he was my Journeyman 5 Months , and he always discharged the Trust I reposed in him with Honour and Honestly , and I do n't know that he was inclined to Cruelty . Mary Chamberlain . I have known him 15 or 16 Years ; he was my Journeyman , and behav 'd himself with as much Honesty and Integrity as any I know . I saw nothing disagreeable in his Temper . I intended to put my Son Apprentice to him ; he lived well with his first Wife . Joseph Lemon . I have known him 16 or 17 Years , he was a mighty pretty , frank , free Man , without Fraction . There was a Report indeed that he had had several Bastards by the Woman of the House where he lodged , but I can say nothing to that , for I know nothing of it . Prisoner . I can call 50 more to my Character , but I will give the Court no farther Trouble . The Jury , after a few Minutes consideration , brought in their Verdict , Not Guilty ; and found , on the Coroner 's Inquisition , that Mary Vezey dy 'd ( by the Visitation of God ) of an Asthma . 14. George Scroggs , of Tottenham , was indicted for assaulting Charles Bellinger , Clerk , in an open Place , near the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Gold-Ring with a Cornelian-Seal , value 10 s. 1 Silk Purse , value 1 d. and 3 s. and 6 d. in Money , on the 14th of February last . Charles Bellinger . I am Curate of Tottenham-Church . On Sunday the 14th of February last , about 10 in the Morning , as I was going from my House to the Church , in a publick Way , about a Quarter of a Mile from the Church , and a 100 Yards from the Houses , I was stopp 'd by the Prisoner , who came out of a Lane Parallel with the Road . He presented a Pistol , and said , If I spoke a Word he would shoot me dead . He took half a Crown from me , and other lose Money , besides a GEOGIUS Half-penny , ( an R being wanting in the Name ) which were all in a Silk-Purse , and from the little Finger of my Left Hand , he took a Gold Ring with a Cornelian Stone , impress 'd with a Mole , which was my Grandmother 's Coat of Arms , and then he return 'd to the Lane he came out of ; I would have gone back into the Road , but with his Pistol he oblig 'd me to go to Church . Since which , he was committed by Justice Bobun of Enfield , for an Assault , with Intent to commit a Robbery . I saw him last Sunday in Newgate . The Keeper refus 'd to let me see him alone , but call 'd all the Prisoners and made them pass by me . I pick 'd him out from the others . The Keeper said that Man 's Name was West ; but , says I , let his Newgate Name be what it will , I know him perfectly well , for he was not disguis 'd when he robb 'd me . William Glover . As soon as Mr. Bellinger came to the Grate in Newgate , he said , I see him already ; the Prisoner in passing held down his Head . Prisoner . I am as Innocent of the Fact as the Child unborn . I was sick of an Ague and Fever at the time the Prosecutor says he was robb 'd , but my Mother , who knows it to be true , and would have been an Evidence for me , is now sick in Shreyshire , and this is sworn upon me only for the sake of the Reward .

What does the Fellow want ? says I , and gave him a Cuff , that beat off his Hat and Wig .

Elizabeth Gammer and Mary Rodes , were indicted for assaulting Thomas Edwards , [ a black Boy ] in the House of the said Mary Rodes , putting him in Fear , and taking from him , 1 Silk Handkerchief , Value 2s . and an Iron Key , Value 1s . the Good of Reginald Bray , Esq ; on the 13th of December last . Thomas Edwards . Between 5 and 6 at Night , as I was going thro ' Colston's-Court in Drury-Lane , Gammer took me by the Hand , and asked me to give her a Dram ; I said , I would not , for I was in haste , and going about my Master 's Business ; and with that , she snatch 'd off my Hat , and run in a Doors ; I followed her , and she locked the Door upon me , and called for Liquor , and told me , I should pay for it ; I told her , I would neither pay nor drink . Then she pulled out a Knife , and swore I should . So I was in amaze , and gave 6 d. for the Brandy to another Woman that belong 'd to the House , and Gammer took it from her , and said , it was not Good . Then they called their Landlady Rodes ( the other Prisoner ) and I said , if they would give me back that 6d . and another , I would give them a Shilling , but Rodes would have the Shilling first , and when I had given it her , she would give me no Change . Then I begged them to let me out , but they beat me and made my Mouth bleed , and made game of me , and they pick 'd my Pocket of a Counter , but when they saw what it was , they gave it me again , and said , Damn him , he 'll swear a Robbery against us . Then the two Prisoners made me go up Stairs , and Gammer knocked me down on the Bed , and called Rodes and they both together turned my Pockets inside out , and took a Handkerchief , a Key , and a Snuff-Box from me ; but when they saw the Snuff-Box was not Silver , they gave it me again . Mary Rodes . When I came in I found the black Boy and Elizabeth Gammer sitting in a publick Room , and drinking Brandy , but I never touch 'd him . Thomas Edwards . Yes , you gave me several Blows on the Face with your Fist , and made me drink some of the Brandy . Thomas Bartlett . When Rodes was before the Justice , she begged for Mercy , and said , she had never been guilty of any such thing before . But , said the Justice , I have had you 4 or 5 Times for Riots . When they were at the Constable 's House they both said , they had never seen the Black . Elizabeth Gammer . As I was going home , about 9 at Night , the black Boy met me , and offered to make me drink , for he said he had not drank with a white Woman a good while . He called for 2 Quarterns , and wanted to go into a private Room to have carnal Knowledge with me . He said he had but a Shilling to pay for the Brandy , but if I would oblige him , he would call again , and satisfy me . John White . When Gammer was before Justice Mitford , she swore the Black was dmn 'd , for she had never seen him in her Life . Margaret Williams . I have laid Mrs. Rodes of five Children , but I do n't know what sort of a House she keeps , for I never looked into it ; for my Business is to be here and there , and every where , you know . Sarah Cart . Mary Rodes is my own Sister , I hope she has a good Character . Her Husband left her big with her last Child . Court . Is her Husband living ? Sarah Cart . I never heard to the contrary . Mary Rodes . My Husband 's Name is William Davis . Court . If she has a Husband the Indictment is laid wrong , for the Robbery is said to be committed in the House of Mary Rodes , but it can not be her House if her Husband is living . The Jury acquitted the Prisoners . Constantine Conway , and Samuel Quan , of St. Dunstan 's in the West , were indicted for Assaulting Job Nutton , in an open Place , called Bolt-Court , near the High-way , putting him in Fear , and taking from him 3 Guineas , and 20 Shillings , Jan. 12 . [ At the Desire of the Prisoners , the Witnesses against them were examined apart . ] Job Nutton . About 7 a Clock , last Wednesday Night , I was going along Fleet-street , to my Master ( who was at the Bull-head Tavern at Temple-bar ) and , on this Side Shoe Lane , there were two Girls , who were singing Ballads ; and a Gentleman threatned to beat the Girls , because some-body had pick 'd his Pocket . I stood a little to see what was the Matter , when Quan ( the tallest of the Prisoners ) stoop 'd down before me , and took up Half a Crown . Sir , says he to me , I believe 't is a good one ; let 's go to the Light at that Shop-window , and see , and , if it is , I 'll give you Half a Pint . We went ; he rubb 'd some of the wet Dirt off : It was a very remarkable Piece ; it was bent , and look 'd as if a Coach-wheel had ran over it . Sir , says he , pray lend me another Half-Crown to compare with it . I did so . He rubb 'd 'em one upon the other , and said , I find 't is good , and for Luck 's sake , I 'll treat you . I have a Friend lives at the upper-end of this Court ( we were then at the lower-end of Bolt-Court ) where we can have a Glass of good Wine . - Come , Sir , I 'll shew you the Way . I was got but a little up the Court , when Conway ( the short , lame Prisoner ) clapp 'd a Pistol to my Breast , and said , Damn you , Sir , deposit . Quan presented another Pistol , at the same Time ; and Conway put his Right-hand into my Left Pocket , and took out 3 Guineas , and 20s . A Woman came up the Court . Quan swore , if I made the least Noise , he would shoot me thro ' the Head . When she was pass 'd , Conway said , Damn you Sir , you have got a Watch , we must have that ; and began to search for it . The String of my Watch was thrust into my Fob , so that they could not get at it readily ; and more Company coming up the Court , Conway walk 'd off , and Quan took me by the Shoulder , led me into the Street , bade me go forward quietly , and swore , if I offer 'd to speak , or turn back , he would be my Death . I went to my Master at Temple-bar , and from thence to the Queen's-head in Red-Lion-Court , in Long-Acre , where I related what had happen 'd , and described the Prisoners so perfectly , that some in the Company said , they knew 'em by the Description , and would send for Mr. Haton , the Constable , who knew their Haunts , and would take 'em . Mr. Haton came ; I gave him the same Description , and he apprehended 'em at a Baudy-house the same Night , and they were carried before a Justice . I swore to Quan , and to the bent Half-crown , which was taken upon him . I was a little scrupulous of swearing too positively against Conway , that Night , on account of his Crutch , For , when Conway robb 'd me , he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket , and I took Notice that his Crutch reached above the Bend of his Arm , and when he was brought before the Justice , I thought that his Crutch , ( which was a short Hand-crutch ) appear 'd to be shorter than it was over Night ; but , next Morning , I consider 'd , that the Difference consisted only in the Position of his Body ; for , when he stooped , his Crutch might reach above the Bend of his Arm , tho ' , when he stood upright , it would reach no higher than his Hand . My Scruple about his Crutch being thus removed ( for I had no doubt as to his Person ) I was fully satisfied , and swore to him as positively as to the other , and I am now certain , that the Prisoners are the two Men that robbed me in Bolt-Court last Wednesday Night . I saw Quan plainly at the Shop-window when we look 'd at the Half-crown ; and I saw them both , when they took my Money , by a Light that came from Bolt-Court Coffee-house . They had light natural Wigs on then , tho ' now they have got dark Wigs to disguise themselves . Conway . Was not you drinking , and playing at Cards with me , at the Mourning-Bush Tavern , at Aldersgate , the Day before you say we robbed you ? Nutton . No : I never was in your Company before you robbed me . Quan . When you was before the Justice , you , at first , said , that you could not swear positively to either of us . Nutton . When I first came into the Room , at the Justice 's , there was but one Candle , and you stood on one Side of me , so that I had not then a full View of your Face . Three more Candles were brought in ; the Half-crown was shewn me , which I knew at first Sight , and swore to be the same that we look 'd on at the Shop-window . Then I turned about , and saw you ; and , as soon as I had looked you full in the Face , I was certain , and swore positively that you was the Man . Quan . What Hour was it when ( as you say ) you was robbed ? Nutton . About 7 , or between 7 and 8 at Night . Joseph Haton , Constable . About 9 a Clock , on Wednesday last , a Gentleman came to me , and told me , that a young Man , who was at the Queen's-Head in Red-Lion-Court , had been robb 'd . I went thither , and found the Prosecutor , who gave me so exact a Description of the Persons who had robb 'd him , that I presently believ 'd the Prisoners to be the Men . He said , That near Bolt-Court in Fleet-street , the tallest of the two Rogues stooped down before him , and took up a Half-crown ; That they went to a Shop-window , to see if it was good : It was dirty , bent in the Middle , and bruised in the Head ; That this Rogue offer 'd to treat him with Half a Pint for Luck 's sake , and carried him up Bolt-Court , where a short , thick , lame Rogue clapp 'd a Pistol to his Breast , and bade him deposit : The tall Rogue presented another Pistol ; the lame Rogue rifled him ; a Woman came up the Court ; the tall Rogue threatned to shoot him , if he spoke ; the lame Rogue felt for his Watch , but the String being in his Fob , and other People coming by , he went off ; and then the tall Rogue , taking him ( the Prosecutor ) by the Shoulder , led him down the Court , and bade him go off quietly , or he was a dead Man . - I knew the Prisoners Haunts , and taking two Men to assist me , I went in search of 'em to James Thomson 's ( a notorious Baudy-house ) in Holsford 's Alley in Drury-lane . This was abouthalf an Hour after Ten . I found no Body at Home but a Woman . I took a Turn in the Neighbourhood , and , posting my two Assistants in a proper Place ( to avoid Suspicion ) I came to the same House again . It was then about 10 or 15 Minutes past 11 , and found 'em both sitting by the Fire . T hey asked me how I did , and if I had any thing to say to them ? I pretended that I had got a Warrant to search for a Woman . They said , they believed them were more Whores and Thieves in Fleet-street , than in Drury-lane . I went out again to see for my Assistants , and ordered one of them to go into the Court , at one End , and one at the other , and so meet at Thomson 's Door . At my return , Quan was standing at the End of the Alley : I seized him , and searching his Pockets , found some Gold and Silver , and this very batter 'd , bent Half-crown . One of his Madams , who was standing by him , lent me this Paper to wrap it in . Then we went into the House , and took Conway . They have followed the Trade of dropping Half-crowns a pretty while . We carried them before Justice Mitford , and sent for the Prosecutor . When the Prosecutor came in , there was but one Candle , but three more were brought , and Quan was standing on one Side of the Prosecutor . I shew 'd the batter 'd Half-crown to the Prosecutor , and as soon as he saw it , he said , I 'll swear to this . The Justice bade him see if he knew any Body there . He turned about , and taking a full View of Quan 's Face , he swore positively , that Quan was one of 'em . You Rascal , says Quan , do you say that I held a Pistol to you ? I never saw you in my Life . The Prosecutor , turning to Conway , said , And I believe this to be the other ; but when he stooped to take the Money out of my Pocket , I thought his Crutch was longer then , than it appears to be now . To which Conway answer 'd much as Quan had done ; You Rascal , did I hold a Pistol to you ? I never saw your Face before . And yet , next Day , one of 'em said to the Prosecutor , How could you be such a Rascal , to swear we robb 'd you , when we won the Money of you at Cards , at the Mourning-Bush at Aldgate - Aldgate ! said the other , No ; it was Aldersgate , and the Drawer will swear it . I asked the Drawer about it , and he said , he did not know the Prosecutor . Joseph Dudley . I went with the Constable to take the Prisoners . When they were examined before the Justice , they both said to the Prosecutor , Ye Rascal , did we hold Pistols to you ? We never saw you in our Lives . But next day they both said they had won it of him at Cards , at the Mourning-Bush , the Day before the Robbery was committed . The Defence of the Prisoners . Quan . Last Tuesday Night , as I was going along Fleetstreet , I found Half-a-Crown , and taking it up , the Prosecutor cry 'd Halves !

They went up one Pair of Stairs into the Room where she lay-in . She was a-bed and asleep . I desired them not to disturb her , and told them that Ann Davis ( who lodged at Mrs. Gray 's next Door ) was married that Day , and the Company were gone to the George Alehouse . I suppose they were acquainted with her . So they went away directly , telling me that they 'd go and sit at the Ale-house a little till my Mistress waked . About an Hour afterwards I was going to Market to get a Leg of Mutton for the Wedding-Supper , and call 'd in at the George to know what Victuals they would have for the Wedding-Supper .

I happen 'd to be coming from London very much in Liquor , and I went into the View of Oxford , about 6 or 7 at Night , on the 17th of December - 't is a Sign - the View of Oxford is a Sign in Chelsea-Road , Mr. Figg keeps the House . I had been drinking frequently , and I may say heartily , in the City of London , so that I was got a little too much by the Head ; and coming into the View of Oxford , the Prisoner was setting by me , and ask 'd me to give her half a Pint of Wine . Prisoner . You say that you pick 'd me up at the View of Oxford . C - B - . No ; I met her in the Park , and took her with me to the View of Oxford , and there I gave her half a Pint of Wine ; and when she went out I felt for my Watch to see if it was Time for me to go home , but I could not find it . Mr. Figg went after her and fetch 'd her in again , and I took the Watch out of her Stomach . Henry Whitby . I am Drawer at the View of Oxford , Mr. C - B - and this Woman came in together about 7 , I shewed them into a private ground Room ; they called for half a Pint of Wine and two Cakes ; after they had staid some time , I heard the Woman sumbling at the back Door , and before I came to her she was got out ; I presently run to the Room where I had left them , to see if he was not gone too , without paying the Reckoning , but I found him there , and he said he had lost his Watch . My Master pursued her : I met him as he was bringing her back , and he told me she was got about 100 Yards towards Buckingham-House when he took her . She deny 'd that she had the Watch . Prisoner . I never deny 'd that I had it , for it was given me as a Pledge for a Guinea . Whitby . She did not pretend then that it was given her , but when he brought her into the Room to search her , I observ 'd that she kept down her right Arm , and examining under that Armpit , I felt the Watch , and said , Here it is ! But , says she , if you take it , I 'll swear a Robbery against you . Then the Prosecutor took it out of her Bosom . Prisoner . I had been but three Weeks in London , and was in St. James's-Park when the Prosecutor came up , and ask 'd if I was a Quaker ? No , Sir , says I . Why do you look so discontented ? says he ; Are you in Service ? No , Sir , I said again , but a Woman in Westminster has promis 'd to get me into one . Why , Child , says he , I am a Gentleman 's Butler , and can provide you with a Place if you will go along with me . The Gentleman being a Stranger I refused to go with him for a good while ; but at last , being willing to get into Business , I was over-persuaded , and he brought me to the View of Oxford , which I have since heard is a very ill House : There he began to be very rude , and offer 'd to put his - I am ashamed to speak it - his Hands up my Petticoats . - I gave him ! to understand , that if he did not behave himself civilly , and like a Gentleman , I would leave the Room . Whereof he said , he had not much Money about him , but if I would oblige him so and so , he would leave his Watch in my Hands till he help 'd me to a Guinea . I was in a great Straight what to do ; I was out of Service , and had no Money , nor any Acquaintance in Town , but Mr. Oakes and his Wife in Swallow-street , and so at last , when he had given me his Watch for a Pledge , I did let him have his Will to the full ; and after he had fulfill 'd his Desire , he asked me several odious , filthy Questions , which my Modesty will not let me repeat . Then I desir 'd him to take his Watch , and let me have the Guinea that he promis 'd me ; but he said , he had but a Shilling in his Pocket , and half of it must pay for the Wine , and a Groat for Cakes , and he would give me the rest . I told him Two-pence was very short of a Guinea . He said , if I would go and fetch some Rods to whip him , he would send for the Guinea . I told him I did not know what he meant by such Discourse , and that that was no Place to get Rods in ; and so I went out , and Mr. Figg follow 'd , and brought me in again . I did not deny the Watch , and Figg took it out of my right Bosom , and then they sent for Thomas Adams , the Constable , and hurry 'd me before Justice Robinson . C - B - . She says that I had to do with her , but upon my Honour I had no Design whatever upon her . Court . Do you use to pick up Women , and carry them into a private Room without any Design ? C - B - . I had no Design , upon Honour , for I have a Wife of my own , who is here in Court . And the Prisoner and I were in a publick Room . Court . The Drawer swears it was a private Room . Was any Body in the Room besides yourself and the Prisoner ? C - B - . No ; but upon my Honour it was a publick Room . I do n't know what other People may call publick ; but I think any Room must needs be publick , if it is in a Publick-House . I took the Watch from her myself , but I was very much suddled , and can not tell whether I took it out of her Bosom or from under her Arm . The Jury acquitted her . 41.

And as I was couching down ( in Hanging-Sword-Alley in Fleet-street ) the Prisoner came up to me , and very immodestly put her Hand betwixt my Legs . The first thing that she laid hold on was my - my Watch-String , and she held it so fast , and Jugg 'd it so hard , that tho ' I catch 'd hold of it myself to save it , I thought in my Conscience she would have pull 'd it off - and so indeed she did at last [ for what could a Man do with such a Woman when his Breeches were down ? She got my Watch out , but the Hook of it hitch 'd in my Fob . Damn you , says she , I never had such a Tustle for a Watch in my Life ; and with that she gave me a punch , and push 'd me clever backwards , and then the Swivel broke , and away she run a-cross the Way . I got up , but had not Presence of Mind to cry Stop Thief ; and so she made off with my Watch , and I afterward , found the String in the Alley . She was three Minutes a struggling with me . Prisoner . How many Women did you charge with this Robbery before you charged me ? Russel . Nell Walker being of the same Size and having the same Voice , I charged the Constable with her ; but said she , it was not I , but Moll Skettlebank that took it , for I was but two Yards off when it was done , and as soon as I saw Moll , I knew her to be the Woman . Court . Did you see the Prisoner 's Face when you lost your Watch ? Russel . No ; but I know her by her Voice and Bulk . Court . You say that Eleanor Walker has the same Voice and Bulk , and how then do you know the Difference ? Russel I am sure that the Prisoner is the Woman . Prisoner . He charged the Constable with Mary James and Betty Gordon , as well as with Nell Walker and me . Russel . I do n't know that I charged any but Nell Walker . Eleanor Walker . I lodge at Mary James 's in Hanging-Sword Court . After he had charg 'd Betty Gordon , he came to my Lodgings , and seeing my Landlady , who is a very fat Woman , and has not been out of Doors these three Weeks . You Son of a Whore , says my Landlord , do you charge my Wife , who has had an Ague and Fever these three Weeks ? my Landlord called me down , I found the Prosecutor there , and Mr. Foquet the Constable ; says Mr. Foquet , is this the Woman ? Yes , says the Prosecutor , and with that I was frighted , and told them , that I passed to and fro in the Alley , I saw Mol l Skettlebank there in a Squabble ; then I went with them to the Crown next Door but one to us . Mr. Foquet . About 11 at Night , the Prisoner came the Watch-house , and I went with him next Day to Nell Walker , By God , says Nell , I 'll never swear for another , it was Moll Sketttlebank that took the Watch , and then ran over the Way to me . We went to Suttle-streets , her Husband Durrel said , he would enquire after it , but his Wife had moved her Lodgings . We could not find her all that Week ; but at last I met her Girls who runs at these Backey-houses , and threatened to send her to Roosewell ; for Fear of which , she told me , where to find the Prisoner . The Prosecutor first me with Mary James , and then with Nell Walker he said , she was such Woman as Mary James . The Jury acquitted her . 42.

He was a second time indicted on the Coroner 's inquisition for the said Murder . Robert Nichols . I am Apprentice to Mr. Bently at the King's-Arms Tavern at Charing-Cross ; I do n't know at what Hour the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner came in , for I was busy in the Cellar , but I came up about 11 in the Morning . The Bell rung , and I went into the Room where the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner were : When I came in , the Prisoner was standing by the Fire-side , and the Deceas 'd was walking about . The Prisoner had me send to the Gunsmith for a pair of Pocket-Pistols with Powder and Bail . I went to the Bar , where John Simmons ( my Fellow-Servant ) was waiting for some Bread and Cheese , which the Deceas 'd had called for . I sent him to the Gunsmith 's , and carried in the Bread and Cheese myself , and leaving it there , I went and dress 'd myself : When I was dress 'd I went in again and stirred up the Fire . The Prisoner said to the Deceas 'd , Turner , Why do n't you send for your Sword ? the Deceas 'd answer 'd , You know the Reason why ; 't is because I have got no Money . And the Prisoner reply 'd , Damn your Blood , you know that I have Money enough . The Deceas 'd rung the Bell , and called for Pen , Ink , and Paper , which was brought , and I went out . I did not see the Pistols brought , but between 12 and 1 , as I was standing at the Street-Door ( which is a Pannel distant from the Door of the Room where the Deceas 'd and the Prisoner were ) I heard a Pistol go off , at which I was startded , and flew from the Door to the Kennel , and presently be thought myself of the Pistols that were sent for about an Hour and a half before . Council . Before the Pistol went off , did you hear any Noise in the Room like struggling ? Nichols . I heard a Noise in the Room just before like walking about , but not like struggling . Immediately after the Pistol went off , the Prisoner came out of the Room , and pulled the Door to , twice , to shut it ; He look 'd as white and as pale as Death , and came hastily out at the Street-Door . Council . Did any Body stand in his Way ? Nichols . There was an Oyster-girl putting up her Oysters at the Door ; he pushed her aside , but did not push her down , and then made his Way up Church-Court . Council . Did he run ? Nichols . No ; he stagger 'd , and seem 'd to be so frighted that he could not run . My Master presently came to the Door , and asked which Way he went ? I told him , and he order 'd the Potter to pursue . My Master and the Porter run up the Court , but return 'd and said , they could not see him . Council . Do you know why they called for Pen and Ink ? Nichols . The Porter told me it was to send for a Sword . Council . Who did you see in the Room when you first went in ? Nichols . No Body but the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd ; but the other Drawer told me there had been a Woman with them before I came . Council . Did you go into the Room soon after the Pistol went off ? Nichols . Yes ; in less than a Minute : The Deceas 'd was sitting on the Ground betwixt two Chairs , with his Back against the Window ; his right Hand was near his Knee , and the Pistol lying on the Ground , within two or three Inches of his right Hand , with the Cock next his Hand , and the Muzzle from him . I saw Blood run out at his right Ear . Prisoner . The first Time you went into the Room , did you not observe Mr. Turner , the Deceas 'd , walking in a melancholly-mad Posture ? Nichols . When I first went in , he was walking gravely , and the second time he was singing . Prisoner . Did not I come out of the Room before you got off of the Steps at the Door ? Nichols . I was by the Kennel-side when I first saw you come out , and pull the Door to , twice . William Bently , Master of the King's-Arms Tavern . I did not see the Prisoner come into my House , but about 11 o'Clock I saw him come out of the Room and hand Mrs. Falkingham into a Coach , and then return into the Room . I was not in the Room all the Time , till the Deceas 'd was Dead . My Drawer told me , that two Gentlemen had order 'd a pair of Pistols , and then , and not before , I knew that there were two in the Room . I was in the Kitchen when the Pistol went off , and my Cook said , I 'll be hang 'd if they have not shot one another . My Cook ran immediately and open 'd the Door ; I followed and looked in , and seeing the Deceas 'd lying on the Ground , I flew after the Prisoner ; I run up Church-Court with all Expedition , but could not get Sight of him ; when I return 'd I found the Deceas 'd sitting on the Ground , his Head leaning to the left Side , which was towards that Side of the Room where the Door was , and the Blood was streaming from the Wound . Council . When the Prisoner handed Mrs. Falkingham into the Coach , did you see any Sword that she had with her ? Mr. Bently . No . Council . Had the Deceas 'd any Sword on after he was shot ? Mr. Bently . I saw none ; and I do n't know of any Alteration that was made in the Room from the Time he was shot to the Time I returned from pursuing the Prisoner , which was but very short ; and when I came back I lock 'd up that Door , leaving every thing in the same Condition as I found it . Prisoner . Was the Deceas'd 's Back close to the Wainscot ? Mr. Bently . Yes ; quite close Prisoner . Was his Back to the Window or his Face ? Mr. Bently . His Back . Prisoner . If his Face had been towards the Window when he received the Wound could he have turned himself about after wards ? Mr. Bently . No . Prisoner . Did Mrs. Falkingham or the Deceas 'd send for me ? Mr. Bently . I know nothing of that but what my Servants told me . John Simmonds , Servant to Mr. Bently . On Friday Morning , the 7th of this Month , the Deceas 'd , and Mrs. Falkingham came in a Coach to my Master 's . I shew 'd them into a Fore-Room . The Prisoner came an Hour afterwards , and went to them ; I carried them in a Pint of White Wine , the Deceas 'd call 'd for Bread and Cheese , and the Prisoner said , Do n't bring a Knife with it . Before I could carry it in they rung again , and Robert Nichols ( my Fellow 'Prentice ) went in , and coming out again , order 'd me to go to a Gunsmith 's , and bid him bring a Brace of small Pistols , with Powder and Ball . I left the Bread and Cheese for Nichols to carry in , and went to speak for the Pistols . The Gunsmith 's young Man came with a Pair , and carry 'd them in ; but I do n't know how long he staid , for I did not see him come out again . The Bell was rung again , I went in , and the Deceas 'd bid me go and see why the Gunsmith did not make haste with the other Pistols ; I went , and met his Man coming down Lancaster-Court with a larger Pair , which he carry 'd into the Room . This is one of them . Mr. Bently . And it is the Same that I took from the Side of the Deceas 'd ; here is still some Hair of the Perriwig sticking to the Muzzle , between the Stock and the Barrel ; and this is the Wig that the Deceas 'd then wore , the Hair is a little sindged on the Right-side . Prisoner to Simmonds . Did the Deceas 'd order you to bring a Knife with the Bread and Cheese ? Simmonds . No . Prisoner . Is it not usual to bring a Knife without Orders ? Simmonds . Yes . Jane Thrasher . I am 'Prentice with Mrs. Goldfinch , a Child 's Coat and Mantua-Maker , in Johnson 's Court , in Fleet-Street . Mrs. Falkingham lodges at our House . On Thursday the 6th of this Month , about 2 in the Afternoon , Mr. Hiller and the Deceas 'd came to Mrs. Falkingham 's ; they went away again , and return 'd in about half an Hour . The Deceas 'd came about 5 ; between 5 and 6 Mr. Hiller and he quarrel 'd prodigiously , they had very high Words , and talked of going to fight the next Day . The Prisoner desir 'd them to be Friends , and not talk of Fighting . With much ado he persuaded them to agree , and they appear 'd to be pretty well reconcil 'd about Six , and sent for a Bottle of Wine , and drank to one another , and all was like to be well . I went into the Parlour , and soon after Mr. Hiller came down , and went away . It was not long before I heard a fresh Noise above ; I went up and found them all 3 standing , the Prisoner , the Deceas 'd , and Mrs. Falkingham . The Prisoner said , Sir , ( or Damn you , Sir , I do n't know which ) bring Sword and Pistol ; and the Deceas 'd answer 'd , I 'll come ready arm 'd . With that I came down , and they all 3 soon follow 'd , and the 2 Men went into the Court , and began to quarrel and make a Noise . The Deceas 'd was standing near the Door , and the Prisoner walking at a Distance . I desir 'd them , if they had any thing to say , that they would come in , and not speak so loud to make a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood . The Deceas 'd would not come in , but the Prisoner did , tho ' he presently went out again , and then they went together down the Court , and thro ' the Arch that leads to Gough's-Square . Neither of them had Sword or Pistol . Mrs. Falkingham said , they were going to fight , and sent me after them to bring them back . I took hold of the Prisoner 's Arm , and desir 'd him to return , but he forc 'd himself from me , and went forward . The Deceas 'd follow 'd , and in going I heard him Name the Word Whore ; but who he meant I do n't know . Between 8 and 9 I went down into the Kitchin , and found the Deceased walking about in great Disorder , and beating his Breast in a violent Passion . I asked him what was the Matter ? He struck his Hand very hard upon his Breast , and said , You can not tell ; but it lies here - Damn her ! she has done her worst , for she has set two Men to kill me . He named no Names , but I thought by the Word her , he might mean Mrs. Falkingham . Council . It seems the Deceased was there late and early , did he lodge at Mrs. Falkingham 's ? Thrasher . No ; Mrs. Falkingham is a married Woman , and has lodged at our House 3 quarters of a Year . Mr. Hiller used to come to see her sometimes , but he has not been so long acquainted with her as the other two . The Prisoner used to come oftner than Mr. Hiller , but the Deceased frequented the House more than both of 'em . Mrs. Falkingham hearing what a Passion the Deceased was in , came down . He made a great Noise at her , so that she said she would go out , that she might prevent a Disturbance in the Neighbourhood . He begg 'd her to stay , because , he said , Mr. Noakes ( the Prisoner ) was coming . She told him she 'd stay for no Noakes , but go directly . His Sword lay in the Kitchin ; she bid me take care of it , and lay it in her Room ; and if Mr. Noakes came , to tell him they were gone to the King's-Arms in the Strand . The Prisoner came about an Hour after , and asked-if Mrs. Falkingham was within ? I told him , No ; she was gone with Mr. Turner ( the Deceased ) to the King's-Arms Tavern . He said , Very well : And seemed dubious whether he should go to them or not , and did not appear to be resolved when he went away . Council . Had the Prisoner a Sword on then ? Thrasher . I am not certain ; but about 11 , or later , a Porter brought this Letter to me . Clerk reads . 'To Mrs. Thrasher , at Mrs. 'Goldfinches , in Johnson 's Court , Fleetstreet . 'Mrs . Thrasher , ' I desire you would be so kind to send by 'the Bearer , my Sword and Belt , and you 'will oblige your humble Servant , W . Turner . Thrasher . I remembered what had hapned over Night , and asked the Porter if there was any Quarrel between the Gentlemen ? and he said , No . The Porter came again before One , and enquir 'd what was the Gentleman 's Name who sent for the Sword ? I ask 'd him his Reason , and he told me he was shot . Then I directed him where he might hear of the Gentleman 's Friends . Council . Did you let the Prisoner know that you had carried the Deceased 's Sword into Mrs. Falkingham 's Chamber . Thrasher . No . Prisoner . Was there not a Quarrel between Mr. Hiller and the Deceased , on the Wednesday before the Accident ? Thrasher . Yes , a great one , and they fought in Hyde-Park . It begun on Sunday Night . Mr. Turner ( the Deceased ) dined with Mrs. Falkingham , and after Dinner they went out , and return 'd with Mr. Hiller , and they were all free and good-humour 'd . The Deceased and Mrs. Falkingham order 'd me to deny her to the Prisoner , if he came ; and so I did . He went from the Door , but turning back presently , said , How could you deny Mrs. Falkingbam ? Says I , She is not within . Who 's above in the Dining-Room ? says he . Why there 's Mr. Turner , says I . And with that the Prisoner went up , and found Mr. Turner and Mr. Hiller , but Mrs. Falkingham was retir 'd , because the Prisoner should not see her . The Prisoner and the Deceased were good Friends ; they ask 'd one another how they did ? and the Prisoner sat down . Mrs. Falkingham desir 'd me to tell Mr. Hiller to go away , and come again in a little time , that so she might get rid of the Prisoner , who she thought would not stay when Mr. Hiller was gone . I took an Opportunity of letting him know her Mind . He went away ; and both the Prisoner and the Deceased followed . Mr. Hiller return 'd before Supper , and while he was there the Deceased came up , and flew into a violent Passion ; Now , says he , I am a happy Man ! I have met my best Friend , Mr. Noakes ! ( the Prisoner ) He 's the best Friend I have in the World ! for now I have found her out ! Then he desired Mr. Hiller to go with him to White 's Coffee-house in Chancery Lane . Mrs. Falkingham said that he should not go , and the Deceased said that he should ; For , says he , I have given Mr. Noakes my Honour upon it that you was not at Home to day when you was deny 'd to him , and I have engaged , on Forfeiture of a Crown ( which I have left in his Hands ) that I will bring Mr. Hiller to vouch it ; and therefore he shall go with me . Well , says Mrs. Falkingham , if you will force Mr. Hiller to go with you , I will go too , and let Mr. Noakes know that I was at home when I was deny 'd . This put the Deceased in a violent Passion again ; he swore and rav 'd , and called her all the ill Words , and abused her at a strange Rate indeed . And he jangled a little with Mr. Hiller ; for , says Mrs. Falkingham , you should not make this Noise , if Mr. Falkingham was at home . No , says the Deceased , and if he was , that snotty-nosed Fellow ( pointing to Mr. Hiller ) should not sit there , neither . Council . Where was Mr. Falkingham then ? Thrasher . In the Country , for his Health . The Deceased was still very uneasy ; he swore and made a Noise , and beat himself several Blows on the Breast , and was very angry . And he still insisted on Mr. Hiller 's going with him . Mr. Hiller was willing , but Mrs. Falkingham would not let him . At last , a Coach was called , and she went with 'em ; and none of 'em came home that Night . On Wednesday Evening , between 4 and 5 , Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea ; and in about half an hour the Deceased came , and another Man with him . While the Gentleman was talking to me , the Deceased went up Stairs . I heard a Noise , and followed . Mrs. Falkingham strove to shove him out of the Room ; but he forced his Way in , and ( going up to Mr. Hiller ) said , Damn you , Sir , you are the Man I wanted ! Come down this Minute , or I 'll lug you out by the Nose . Mr. Hiller was in some Confusion , and the Deceased swore he would have his Will of him ; and he swore at Mrs. Falkingham too ; but she would not let Mr. Hiller go out with him . The Deceased abused her , and said , I will stay then till he goes ; and so sat down , but in the greatest Disorder imaginable , swearing and beating his Breast violently , till at last he had work 'd Mr. Hiller up to a Passion , who then got up , and said , Pray , Sir , what Tavern are you for ? The other answer 'd , The Horn . Mr. Hiller went down , and was follow 'd by the Deceased and the Gentleman who came with him . I afterwards went to enquire for 'em at the Horn , but they were gone . It was past 10 , before they came back to Mrs. Falkingham 's ; she was sitting with her Apron over her Face when they came up , and pulling it off , she saw Mr. Hiller first , and said , Thank God , you 're come home alive ; but turning her Head short , and seeing the Deceased , she gave a Shriek , and fell into a sort of a Fit . After she recover 'd , Mr. Hiller said to the Deceased , Shall I proceed ? and he answer 'd , No , not for the World ; I will not live to hear it . But , says Hiller , I will tell , and tell the Truth ; and so addressing himself to Mrs. Falkingham , Madam , says he , Thank God I am come home alive ! for Turner ( the Deceased ) has wounded me , and it might as well have been my Death as not . Then turning to Mr. Turner , he said again , Shall I proceed ? No , not for the World , says Mr. Turner . But Mr. Hiller went on . We have been and fough t , Madam . We have been as far as Hyde-Park . When we were at the Horn Tavern , we sent for Swords , but the Master of the Tavern would not let us have any . But I got two at a Sword-Cutler 's . We went to the Park together ; Turner would have had me to have gone on farther ; but I refused . Then draw , says he ; and I did . He prick 'd me in the Hip , my Foot slip 'd , and I fell . He came and stood over me with his Sword . Now , says he , if you do n't promise to ask Mrs. Falkingham to pardon me , you are a dead Man . It being dark , and I being frighted , I gave him my Promise ; and so we return 'd hither in a Coach . And now , Madam , I must desire that you would grant him your Pardon . When Mr. Hiller had spoke this , the Deceased fell on his Knees to Mrs. Falkingham , and begg 'd her Pardon , and confess 'd that he had injur 'd her wrongfully . She said , I 'll forgive you as a Christian , if you 'll never disturb my Peace any more . He begg 'd for leave to visit her , as formerly , she deny 'd him . Then he begg 'd for leave to come and drink Tea with her at 3 the next Day ; which she at last consented to ; and then appeared as much over-joyed and elevated as he was passionate before . And will you forgive me , says he , then I am this Night the happiest Man living ! How am I obliged to Mr. Hiller for making us Friends ! He was subject to very extravagant Passions . Prisoner . Did you never hear him threaten to kill himself ? Thrasher . One Sunday I heard him tell Mrs. Falkingham that he would go and hang himself . He went into another Room , and she bid me go and watch him ; but I laugh 'd and said he had more Wit than that came to . Council . Did not the Deceased charge the Prisoner with being too great with Mrs. Falkingham ? Thrasher . The Night before Mr. Turner was shot , I heard him reflect on Mrs. Falkingham for being too great with the Prisoner ; but I never heard him speak to the Prisoner about it , nor never heard that they quarrelled on that account . Council . Did you never hear that Mr. Falkingham left Mr. Turner as a Guardian over Mrs. Falkingham ? Thrasher . I have heard her say that Mr. Turner said he was left as a sort of a Guardian over her by her Husband . Richard Turner , Brother of the Deceased . A Day or two after Mr. Falkingham went out of Town , which , I think , was on the first of January , my Brother ( the Deceased ) among other Discourse said ; Before Mr. Falkingham went , he desired his Wife to see no Man but me . My Brother lodged with me , and , about 9 the Night before he was murder 'd , he call 'd at the Door , and gave me his Pocket-Book , a Letter , and Haunthal 's Overthrow , and bid me take care of 'em , and let no Body see them , and especially the Letter . I asked him , if he would come in ? He said , No . I saw one with him , and asked , who it was ? He said , Mr. Noakes . I did not know Mr. Noakes ; and I never saw my Brother any more . Eliz . Whiscard . The Deceased came Home on Monday Night , sate down by the Fire , pulled out a Letter , and stooped down to read it by the Fire-light . When he had read it , he said to his Mother , Ca n't I take up a Man that threatens my Life ? Yes , sure , said his Mother . Why , says he , I am threatned to be shot through the Head . Let me know who it is , Child , said she , and I 'll secure him . That would be pretty indeed , says he . Mary Wilkinson . I heard Words to the same Purpose . He read the Letter by the Fire , and , Madam , says he , ca n't I send any Body to Newgate , that threatens my Life ? Yes , Child , says his Mother , let me know who it is , and I 'll take care of him . Aye ! says he , that would be very pretty indeed . But , ca n't I swear the Peace against him ? Yes , to be sure , said she . Pray , Madam , says he , put your Hand in my Bosom , and feel my Heart . She smiled ; but he , repeating his Request , she did so , and declared , she never felt any thing flutter so in her Life . He was so out of Order , that he did not go to the Office the next Day , but staid till the Day following . He was Clerk at the East-India-House . We do n't know who the Letter came from : But on Thursday , about two a Clock , he was sent for ( by Mr. Hiller , as it was said ) and he went out gay and lively . Ann Armor . I was in the next Room to the Deceased . I heard him say twice , That his Life was threatned , and that he was not to live a Week longer . James Wilky , Surgeon . Between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon , after the Deceased was shot , I opened his Head ; the Wound entred at the Right Ear , and past neither upward nor downward , but parallel . The Pistol was clapp 'd so close to the Head , that no Powder appear 'd on the outside , but it all pass 'd into the middle of the Brain , and being confined , had split the Skull , and raised the upper-part of it , so that I had no need to make use of a Saw . If the Pistol had been held with a full extended Arm , it might have recoil 'd . The two Bullets were lodged close to the Left Side of the Scull , but had not perforated it . C. Was the Pistol put into the Ear ? Mr. Wilky . No , but a little higher than the natural Orifice of the Ear : The Bullets split the Flap of the Ear , went thro ' the Temporal-Bone , and made but one Orifice in the Skull , and one continued Wound . These are the 2 Bullets ; I found 'em thus close together , and one dented against the other . The Instant the Powder enter 'd the Brain , the Deceased could have no Sense , or feeling of Pain . It was immediate Death . John Sergeant , Surgeon . The Wound was just above the Meatus Anditorium . The Explosion of the Powder has raised the Skull . The Bullets inclined rather upwards than on a Level . They had broke the Cranium on the other Side , but had not gone thro ' the Scalp . C. Could a Man , in shooting himself hold a Pistol so that the Wound would not have gone more instant upwords ? Mr . Sergeant That would be according to the Position of his Head , whether he it upright , or leaned it aside . John Spranger . I lodged White 's Coffee-house , in Chancery-lane . The Deceased , and Mr. Hutton came to see me and brought the Prisoner with them . Then began to talk about Mrs. Falkingham . The Prisoner said to the Deceased , Pray was she at Home with I was there to ask for her ? The Deceas 'd seem 'd unwilling to answer at first , but afterwards he gave the Prisoner his Honour the she was not . To which the Prisoner reply 'd , If I should find that she was at Home , I hope that you will not refuse - and then mutter 'd something which I could not hear . After this , I heard the Prisoner say , I would not value shooting any Man in the Head ; and , if it was not for the Law , I would rob all the Company . Prisoner . Was not that spoke in a merry Way only ? Spranger . We were upon a serious Subject - Religion . He spoke of Religion in a merry , ludicrous Way , but , I believe , he was very serious in it . He said , There was no such Thing as a God ; and if there was a God , that he himself was Part of the Divine Being . The Deceased went away , and brought a Lady to the Door in a Coach . I would not let her come in , because the House is a civil House , and the Woman that keeps it , will not admit of such Company . The Prisoner hearing she was come , spoke to her in the Coach , and then took his Hat and went away . Prisoner . Did you ever see me before ? Spranger . No ; nor never desired to see you again , after I had heard your Discourse . Robert Hutton . I was with the Prisoner at White 's in Chancery-Lane . He said , He did not believe there was either God , or Devil , or Jesus Christ , or Saviour , or any Thing else . And if it was not for being hang 'd , and for his Honour he would rob all the Company round , and think it no Sin to knock 'em o ' the Head . C. Did you hear him say any thing of shooting Men in the Head ? Hutton . No . On the Thursday following , about 9 at Night , the Deceased came , and a Man with him , to borrow my Sword ( as my Maid told me , for I was not at Home ) and the Maid lent it him . But this is my Sword , and I had it again from the Coroner : The dge is nick 'd , asif it had clashed against another . Jane Thrasher . This I believe to be the same Sword that the Deceased left with me , and Mrs. Falkingham bade me take care of . Hutton . He sent his Brother to borrow it on the Wednesday Night , but then it was brought back again ; and the next Night ( as I said ) my Maid lent it him . Richard Turner . On Wednesday Night , my Brother ( the Deceased ) sent a Porter to desire me to borrow a Sword . I borrowed it of Mr. Hutton , and went with it to the Tavern , and left it at the Bar , for the Drawer would not let me carry it in , because he said , the Gentlemen were quarrelling . I went in to them , and the Prisoner said , If they wo n't let us have 'em , we will send to a Sword-Cutlers for two ; and you shall fight Hiller , and I will fight your Brother . Susan Williams . I am Maid to Mrs. Goldfinch , at the uppermost House on the Left-hand in Johnson 's Court . On Thursday the Prisoner , and the Deceased , and Mr. Hiller , were in Mrs. Falkingham 's Room . I carried up the Tea . The Deceased and Mr. Hiller had high Words , but were afterwards pacified , and had a Bottle of Wine together . They went away between 9 and 10 ; and between 12 and 1 , I heard a clashing of Swords in the Court , and , as I thought , the Voices of the Prisoner and the Deceased . I have often seen the Deceased behave himself much out of Order . And the Sunday Night before he quarrell 'd with Mr. Hiller . Tho Jones , a Porter . About Noon , the Deceased sent me from the King's-Arms Tavern , in the Strand , to Mrs. Thrasher for the Sword . I knock 'd , the Maid came to the Door , and Mrs. Thrasher brought the Sword , and asked me , if the Gentleman had a Lady in Company ? I did not answer it directly , for fear Mrs. Thrasher should be his Wife . I afterwards went to her again , to tell her that the Deceased was shot . Prisoner . Did not Mrs. Falkingham send you for me to the Huminums ? Jones . Yes ; about 9 in the Morning I went , by her Directions , with a Letter for you , and asked , if you did not come about 4 in the Morning ? The Waiter said , he 'd go and see . I staid a quarter of an Hour , and he came and said , you was not there . I asked him , if he was sure of it ? and he said , Yes . So I brought the Letter back again , and laid it on the Table . The Deceased took it up , open 'd it , and look 'd in it , and then threw it in the Fire . Prisoner . How long had Mrs. Falkingham and the Deceased been at the King's-Arms , before I was sent for ? Jones . Hardly a quarter of an Hour . The Prisoner 's Defence . Dorothy Falkingham . The Deceased dined with me on Sunday . After Dinner we went together , and called on Mr. Hiller , in Hatton-Garden , and from thence we all 3 went into the City , and returned in the Evening . The Deceased desired , that I might be denied to the Prisoner , and he bid the Maid tell him ( if he came ) that I was not at Home . He came before Supper . Mrs. Thrasher denied me ; he went from the Door , and I coming down at the same Time , I suppose he heard my Voice , for he turned about , and asked Mrs. Thrasher , why she denied me ? She insisted upon it . He asked her who was above ? She said , Mr. Turner ( the Deceased . ) He came up , I retired . He staid half an Hour , and then he and the Deceased went together , to White 's Coffee-house in Chancery-lane , but Mr. Hiller staid to Supper . The Deceased left Word that he would be back again in half an Hour . He did not stay long , and when he returned , he said to me , that he had told the Prisoner , upon his Honour , that I was gone into the City , and would not be at Home all Night . I said , I was surprized that he should give his Word and Honour upon any Thing that was so false , and that I would send the Prisoner Word that I was at home . He swore and called me Bitch , and other ill Names ; I asked Mr. Hiller to go with me ; we called a Coach : The Deceas 'd made such a Noise , and behaved himself so strangely , that he rais 'd a Mob in the Street , and while the Coach was driving along , he never called for the Coachman to stop , but forced the Door open , and jump 'd in . When we came to the Coffee-House , Mr. Hiller , to avoid Quarrelling , went out and left me with him in the Coach , where he abused me , and called me Names . I sent in for the Prisoner , who came out to know my Business ; I told him I came to satisfy him that I was at home when the Maid denied me , and asked him to go with me to the King's-Arms at Charing-Cross , because I would not have a Noise at home to disturb the Neighbours . I desired the Deceas 'd to go home to Bed , for he was much disturb 'd and not in his Senses , but he would go with us . When we came to the Tavern , the Prisoner called for a Stake , for says he to the Deceas 'd , You have supp 'd , but I have not . The Deceas 'd abused me so there , that I said it was unsufferable , and I would stay no longer , and so I desired the Prisoner to call a Coach . About 10 the next Morning , Mr. Hiller called on me , and told me if ever I suffered Turner to come into my Lodgings again I should be very much to blame , and I ordered myself to be deny 'd to him . There was no bearing his Company , he made such a Disturbance . A Week before this , at Chelsea , he threatened to kill himself , and ask 'd me to lend him a Penknife , he said he had ruin 'd a Woman in Exeter-Street , and she had ruin 'd him ; he behav 'd himself like a mad Man , and I do n't believe he knew what he did . On Wednesday , about Four , Mr. Hiller came to drink Tea with me , in half an Hour my Maid came up and told me , the Deceas 'd was below . I lock 'd the Door ; he forced it open . I asked him what he wanted ? and why he made such a Disturbance ? he turned to Mr. Hiller , and said , I have found the Villain I wanted ; come out this Moment , or I 'll pull you out by the Nose . G - d damn you , I have lost my own Peace , and I care for No-body 's else . Mr. Hiller slipt down and left his Hat , the Deceas 'd follow 'd , and they went away together . I took Coach and call 'd at several Taverns to enquire after them , but could not find them . They came back after 10 , says Mr. Hiller . We have been to fight in Hyde-Park , my Foot slipp 'd , and Turner taking the Advantage , made me promise to get his Pardon of you . Turner ask 'd Leave to come and drink Tea with me at 4 next Day ; I told him , if he behaved himself civilly he might . Next Day they both came to drink Tea ; the Deceas 'd asked me if we were Friends ? I said , Yes . But , says he , I must fight Hiller again ; I will have his Blood , or he shall have mine ; for I am resolved not to live . Mr. Hiller was then present . The Prisoner came up about 5 , I told him I was glad he was come to vindicate me , tho ' I wonder 'd he should take the Liberty of saying such Things of me to Mr. Turner . Council . What Things ? Mrs. Falkingham . Mr. Hiller told me that Mr. Turner said , the Prisoner had told him , that he lay with me all Night . Council . That who lay with you ? Mrs. Falkingham . That the Prisoner did , and then told Turner of it , and Turner told Hiller : Upon this Turner said that Hiller had bely 'd him in saying so , and Hiller insisted upon it , that Turner did tell him . The Prisoner endeavoured to make them Friends , and at last prevailed with them so far , that Hiller begged Turner 's Pardon , and owned that what he had said was false . They appeared to be pretty well pacified ; but as Mr. Hiller was going away , Mr. Turner , the Deceas 'd , said to him , I expect to see you to-Morrow , or I 'll pull you by the Nose in the India-House . I found that the Deceas 'd was not yet easy , and therefore I said to the Prisoner , Let us go to the Horn to Supper and avoid him . Upon this the Deceas 'd began to swear and rave , and call me Bitch and Whore . We came down to the Door , and he and the Prisoner went into the Court Mrs. Thrasher desired them to come in , and not make a Noise there to disturb all the Neighbours . The Deceas 'd says to the Prisoner , If you have any thing to say to me I 'll answer you . The Prisoner replies , Sword and Pistol then . With all my Heart , says t'other , and so away they went . I sent Mrs Thrasher after them to persuade them to come in again , but I saw no more of them till between 12 and 1 that Night . Prisoner . In what Manner did I speak when I said Sword and Pistol ? Mrs. Falkingham . You spoke it laughing , in a joaking Manner . Between 12 and 1 , as I lay abed , I thought I heard them quarrelling under my Window , I got up and look 'd out , and ask 'd them what they meant by making that Disturbance to fright me ? They both burst out a laughing and went away . Between 4 and 5 the same Morning they came again , and walked to and fro under my Window ; I heard the Prisoner say to the Deceas 'd , Turner , This is as bad as walking upon the Quarter-Deck at Sea , at which Turner laugh 'd . I look 'd out again , and said to them , Why do you disturb the Neighbourhood thus ? I thought you bad bad more Sense , Mr. Noakes , tho ' Turner has not . Upon this Mr. Noakes , the Prisoner , went away , and Turner sung and tanted , and by and by he fell on his Knees and ask 'd me Forgiveness , and said he was the happiest Man living , and Mr. Noakes was his best Friend for reconciling us . I asked him why they came there to fight ? he said 't was only to frighten me , and then he went away . Between 7 and 8 he knock 'd at my Door , the Maid let him in ; I stepp 'd down and ask 'd him why he disturb 'd me so early ? says he , I have been rambling all Night , Mr. Noakes is my best Friend , and now I have no Body to make my Peace with but you . I am surprized , said I , that you behave yourself in this Manner : You have made such a Noise , and a such a Disturbance in the Court , that I must be forced to leave my Lodgings , my Landlady wo n't let me stay in the House any longer . G - d damn your Landlady , says he , she 's an old Bitch ; lend me a Knife , and I 'll rip her up . I desir 'd him to be easy till I was dress 'd : I went and dress 'd me , and bid the Maid call a Coach ; he said he would not go yet , for his dear Friend Noakes was a coming . I told him he might stay if he would , but I would go ; with that he threw down his Sword , and I bid the Maid take Care of it . We took Coach together , and drove to the King's-Arms , and were shown into the Fore-Room next the Street ; we called for a Pint of Mountain and a French-Roll ; says he , Are you sure you are Friends with me ? I told him he had ruin 'd me , and I must abandon my my Lodgings and go-but I knew not where . Then he cry 'd and stamp 'd , and pull 'd a hot Poker out of the Fire , and run it against his Breast twice or thrice . I call 'd the Drawer , and then he laid by the Poker and sat down . I told him I wanted to see Mr. Noakes , the Prisoner , before I went , and d esired him to tell me where he was ; he said that he knew , and that Mr. Noakes was his best Friend , but that he would not tell me . I thinking he might go to the Bagnio after he went from my Window that Morning , I wrote a Letter and sent a Porter with it to the Hummums to see if he could find him ; the Porter returned , but could not hear of him , and laying the Letter down , the Deceas 'd took it up and read it , and then threw it in the Fire . In about half an Hour after , the Prisoner came , asked the Deceas 'd how he did , and they shook Hands . Then the Prisoner ask 'd me if I wanted him ? I said Yes ; I am going away , and thought it proper to see you before I went , that if any Reflections should be made on my Conduct , you may give me no worse Character than I deserve . The Deceas 'd said , And will you go ? Then I am a ruin 'd Man ; and burst out a crying - and you shall bear of it very soon . Mr. Noakes had on a mourning Sword ; the Deceased snatch 'd it suddenly from his Side , and run himself into the Breast with it ; and had run himself through if we had not prevented him . He pull 'd out his Shirt , it was bloody , and said , See - I have not done it effectually yet - but it 's no Matter . Then he fell into a great Passion again , and sweated and swore , and behav 'd himself like one distracted . Well , says I , 't is no Time for me to stay ; for since you are a mad Man I will be gone . Pray , says the Prisoner , take the Sword with you for Fear of Danger . I went from thence to Mr. Hiller in Hatton-Garden , and about 5 a Clock the same Day , I saw the Prisoner again . Council . Did he take the Poker out himself ? Mrs. F. Yes . Council . What sort of a Poker was it ? Mrs. F. It was pretty thick , and about 3 quarters of a Yard long . Coun . How did he hold it ? Mrs. F. By the middle . Council . Was he standing or sitting ? Mrs. F. He sat in a Chair , and taking the Poker , he said , I 'll rip my self up with this . His Coat was open , and I think he run the the Poker against his Waistcoat . Council . After he laid the Poker down , did you take it up ? Mrs. F. Yes . Council . And how did you hold it ? Mrs. F. By the Top . Council . Was it hot ? Mrs. F. I do n't know how hot it was , I had my Gloves on , and after he had laid down the Poker , he run about the Room , and said , he was damn 'd , and nothing but damnation could make him easy . Council . How did he take the Sword ? Mrs. F. We were all sitting at the Table . He sat at the Prisoner 's Left-Hand , betwixt him and the Fire , and starting up suddenly he snatch 'd the Sword , and run round one side of the Table to the Window . He said , He had ruin 'd one Woman in Exeter-Street , and now be had ruin 'd me , and nothing but his Life would make amends . Council . Did you appoint the Prisoner to meet you in the Evening ? Mrs. F. Yes ; I desir 'd him to be at the India Coffee-House about 5 , and I went thither and found him . Council . Did the Deceas 'd hear you make that Appointment ? Mrs. F. Yes . Council . What great Business had you with the Prisoner , that you made this Assignation to meet him at a precise Time and Place . Mrs. F. Business ? I wanted to see him ; I did not appoint 5 a Clock precisely , I said , I would call on him in the Evening about 4 or 5 , and I knew that he was usually to be found at that Coffee-House . Council . You had seen him but that Morning , why did you want to see him again so soon ? Mrs. F. If I had a Mind to see him again , and again , I hope there was no harm in that . Council . To what other Places did you go that Night ? Mrs. F. I was that Night with Mr. Hiller and a Relation , at the Vine in Holborn , and at a Friend 's House on London-bridge . Council . When you came to the Prisoner at the India Coffee-house , did he tell you presently what had happen 'd ? Mrs. F. No ; I sent the Sword in by the Coachman . Council . Do you know such a Person as Mr. Falkingham . Mrs. F. Yes ; he is my Husband . Council . Where is he now ? Mrs. F. In Derby . Council . What Discourse had the Deceased with you about your Husband ? Mrs. F. Nothing Material . Council . Did you never hear that your Husband left him to be your Guardian ? Mrs. F. I have heard the Girls in the House call him my Guardian , in a merry Way , but no otherwise . Council . Who took those Lodgings for you at Mrs. Goldfinch 's ? Mrs. F. My Husband . Council . Did the Deceased never tell you that your Husband had desir 'd him to caution you against keeping Company with the Prisoner ? Mrs. F. No . Council . You say , that as soon as the Deceased had attempted to stab himself at the King 's Arms , you saw that his Shirt was bloody ; did you then look in his Bosom to see if there was any Wound ? Mrs. F. No . Council . You say , that he frequently behav 'd himself like a Madman ; How came you to venture yourself to a Tavern with a Madman ? Mrs. F. I was not apprehensive that he would hurt me , for he din 'd at our House almost every Day . Jame Freeman , the Gunsmith 's Apprentice . The Drawer of the King 's Arms came for a Pair of small Pistols with Powder and Bullets . I went with them into a Room where the Prisoner and the Deceased were . Each of 'em took one . The Deceased said that these were too small ; that they wanted a Pair three times as long ; and that an old Pair would do ; for they only wanted to borrow them , for they were going to Windsor in a Chaise ; and then he bid me fetch a larger Pair , and bring Powder and Bullets . I went back , and as I was returning , I met the Drawer coming to hasten me . I carry 'd the Pistols in ; each of the Gentlemen took one . The Deceased asked the Price , I told him a Guinea ; for they were old Pistols . The Prisoner asked if they must leave the full Value ; I told him Yes . The Deceased said , that then , one wou 'd be sufficient , and gave me half a Guinea ; and ask 'd me if I brought Powder and Ball ? I told him , Yes . He bid me charge it ; and when I had put in the Powder , he bade me put in more . The Prisoner try 'd with the Rammer , and said there was enough . Then I put in a Ball ; the Deceased bid me put in another . The Prisoner said , Why so ? Because ( says the Deceased ) when I do any thing , I love to do it to the Purpose ; and if they come , I 'll pop 'em . I suppose he meant he would pop the Rogues , if he met any . When I had loaded the Pistol , I put it into the Deceased 's Hand . He open 'd the Pan to see if it was primed , and then shut it again , and laid it down . The Prisoner was then standing on the other Side of the Table ; that Side from the Door , and the Deceased near the Window , that Side next the Fire-place , on the Right-Hand of the Fire ; I heard of the Accident in about half an hour after . Council . How did the Deceased behave himself , did he appear to be any way disordered in his Senses ? Freeman . I did not see any uncommon Behaviour in him , and I thought he talked rationally . William Penkethman . On Thursday Night , or rather Friday Morning , 'twixt 2 and 3 ; the Prisoner and Deceased , 'Rack Punch were drinking at the Rummer Tavern in Drury-Lane - for then I found 'em there , and sociable they seem 'd , and drank and talk 'd like Friends , till Watchmen cry 'd Past 4 a Clock ! The Reckoning was a Crown , Noakes paid it all . From thence we rambled to King 's Coffee-house , in Covent-Garden . Ale and Orange there we drank , and still they cordial Friends appear 'd - They told me that they had been serenading some Ladies , but they did not tell me who . And what ( said they ) is your Opinion , Sir , of such Diversion ? I assured 'em that I was not fond of Catterwauling Frolicks . At 5 I left 'em , and return 'd at 6 , and found 'em still together very friendly . 'T was after 7 when the Deceased arose , and asked the Prisoner if he would go with him ? But he refused to go ; then the Deceased bad him Good Morrow , and went out alone . Council . Did the Deceased appear to be out of his Senses ? Mr. Penkethman . No , Sir , I did not take him to be mad , but rather thought he was a little silly . For he wou 'd laugh at every thing that pass 'd , at every Word was spoke , tho ' nothing merry , nor fit to raise a Smile ; the meerest Trifle imaginable wou 'd set him on the twitter - When he was gone I importuned the Prisoner to cross the Water with me and two more who were in Company , to spend the Day in Merriment ; ( for I had then no Knowledge that I should at the Theatre be wanted ) the Prisoner gave Consent , we all agreed , and down Southampton-Street we took our Way ; a Servant to the Theatre by chance we met ; his Business was at Tavern Doors and City Gates the Play-house Bills to fix . I view 'd his Bills , and found , that very Night a Part appointed was for me to act , in Th ' Amorous Widow , or the Wanton Wife ; and by His Royal Highness 's Command . Our Journey then was stopp 'd , and so to the Rummer in Drury-Lane we all return 'd , at 9 , but did not tarry , for they had no Fire . We to the Play-house went , and breakfasted , and after 10 we parted . Council . If you had not met that Man with the Play-house Bills , should you and the Prisoner have gone over the Water together ? Mr. Penkethman . Yes , we had so agreed ; and I believe , had we not thus prevented been , we had spent the whole Day together . Tho Hiller [ Helar . ] On Friday Morning Mrs. Falkingham came to me in a Coach . Madam , says I , where are you going ? I do n't know , says she , I have left Turner and Noakes together . I saw her have a mourning Sword , and was afraid the Deceased had sent it to me as a Challenge , and begg 'd her to satisfy me whether it was so or not . She said , No ; but she brought it away to prevent Mischief , for Turner was very obstreperous . Several People taking notice of my talking to her at the Coach Door , I stepp 'd in , to prevent farther Observation , and bid the Coachman drive on towards the City . We stopp 'd at the Fountain at Snow-Hill . There she told me that the Deceased had called on her before she was up , and had made such a Disturbance that she must be forced to leave her Lodgings . The Deceased was always in a great Passion when he saw me , but would give no Reason for it . He would stamp about , and use such violent Expressions - Council . Did she tell you that Turner had attempted to kill himself ? Hiller . Yes , she said he had endeavoured it two or three times . Council . Did she say in what manner ? Hiller . I think not . Council . Did she say any thing of a Poker ? Hiller . I heard her speak of the Poker , but I do n't remember the Particulars . Council . Did she tell you in what Place he was when he took the Poker . Hiller . No . Council . Did you ever hear the Deceased talk of killing himself ? Hiller . Yes , he has talked of it in my Hearing , and he has desired me to do it for him . Council . On what Occasion did he talk thus ? Hiller . I do n't know . Council . How long have you known him ? Hiller . Two Years . He belong 'd to the India-House , and so do I ; but I never before knew him in such a Condition as he was in for a Fortnight past . John Rice . I keep the East-India Coffee-house in Leaden-hall street . The Prisoner came in at about a Quarter past One ; sate down in a publick Room next the Street , without drawing the Curtains , and wrote a Letter . He staid about 20 Minutes ; then he went out , and , in a little Time , came in again , and went up Stairs , and staid about two Hours and a half . He went out with a Coachman that came to him . John Holms . On Friday , in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came into our Coffee-house , and went up Stairs into the Billiard-Room , where he play 'd at Billiards , and staid about 2 Hours , but I did not see him when he first came in . Joseph Coltman . I had been at the India Coffee-house , with my Musick-Master , and going out between 1 and 2 , I met the Prisoner . He seem 'd surprized , and said , He had just seen the Death of a young Fellow . I asked him , how ? He answer 'd , he shot himself . Do I know him ? says I . His Name is Turner , says he , and he belongs to the India-House . Says I , You will infallibly be taken up , and therefore I would advise you to go to your Father 's . Was there any Difference betwixt ye ? No , says he . What was it about , then ? said I . A Woman , says he , and I saw him falling as I came out of the Room , and I hardly know how I got hither . I came down Stairs with the Prisoner , between 2 and 3 , and saw a Coachman give him a Mourning Sword . The Prisoner told me , there was a Woman in the Coach , and so he went away . I have known him three Years , he was a good-natur 'd , quiet Man . - Hartop , Esq ; The Prisoner is my Cousin , I have known him from his Youth , he was never quarrelsome , but always ready to make up Quarrels Robert Manwaring . I am intimate in the Family , and never saw any thing in his Behaviour but what was decent and sober . Mr. Hays . I have known him from a Child . I never knew him in a Quarrel ; he was very good-natur 'd . Mr. Barus . I have known him several Years to be a quiet , peaceable Man . Dr. Bamber . I have known him from his Birth , to be peaceable and good-natur 'd . Mr. Booth . I have known him 16 Years , to be a good-natur 'd , familiar , pleasant , merry , jocose Man . Mr. Daniel . I have been very intimate with him , and often in his Company for 3 Years past . He was very civil and good-natur 'd , and never given to use ill Words . Council . Where 's Mr. Wilky the Surgeon ? - Sir , when you examin 'd the Deceased , did you observe any Blood on his Shirt , or any Wound in his Breast ? Mr. Wilky . I examin 'd no farther than his Head ; but the Blood that came from the Wound had cover 'd the Breast of his Shirt . Robert Sherot . I saw the Body stript , there was much Blood on the Shirt , and jelly 'd about the Breast , but I did not see it cleaned , nor did I look for a Wound . John Parker . I saw the Body cleaned ; I do n't remember any Wound in the Breast : But I took no Observation , as not thinking of any such Thing . And the Waistcoat has since been scoured , so that one ca n't see whether it was finged on the Breast ; for the Scouring has fetch 'd off the Nap .
