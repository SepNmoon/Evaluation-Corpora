I stopt the Goods 'till they should satisfy me as to their Characters ; they told me they would fetch a Person who knew them , but I never saw them any more . By Dodd 's Information Harris was directed to me for the Goods I remember one of the Lads told me his Name was Nixon , and the other Thomas Cole . Acquitted of the Burglary , guilty of the Felony 39s 39 . He was a second Time indicted with William Dobson , for stealing two Cocks , value 2 s. and eight Hens value 8 s. the Goods of John Peacock . John Peacock The Fowls were in my Yard on the Friday Night the 2d of April : The next Morning my Pales were broke and the Fowls were gone . While I was at Change , a Man left Notice at my House , that this Dodd was seen with a Sack full of Fowls : We took him before Justice Farmer : He would own nothing till we took the little Boy Dobson ; then he made himself an Evidence , and by his Directions , we took Nixon , and found five of my Fowls alive at one Nevet 's in the & ack lane , Well-street . Nevet denied them , but upon searching with a Warrant , I found five in his House . Thomas Dodd . The 3d of April Dobson and I was going down Armitage street , and Nixon coming by , he told us there was Fowls in this Yard , and we agreed to have them . We went down and broke the Pales , and took out two Cocks and 8 Hens ; 5 of which we sold to Nevet alive ; 2 we sold dead over against Nevet 's House ; two we sold in Petticoat-lane , and one we gave away : When the Fowls were disposed of , we all three went into Petticoat-lane ; there we shared the Money , and bought a Hog 's Face , which we eat in an Alehouse . Nevet appeared , and was examined ; but the Court understanding that he was indicted as an Accessary , the Jury was inform 'd that they must not regard his Evidence . Dobson 's Defence . I met with Dodd and Nixon in Well Street , and they made me drink half a Pint of Gin ; I was drunk , and went with them to the Corner of the Lane ; I stood at the Corner , and they brought the Fowls to me . Jane Dobson . I know nothing but that my Child is very honest . Susan Bunn . I never heard any Harm of him . I have known him 4 or 5 Years . Susan Spolston . I may say I have known him before he was born , for I knew his Mother before he was born , and know nothing of him but that the Boy 's a little short witted . Nixon acquitted . Dobson guilty 10 d.

William Stephens , was indicted for that he March 15 on Catherine Skelton wilfully , maliciously , and feloniously , did make an Assault , and with both his Hands and Feet , in and on the Ground , the said Skelton did cast and throw ; and the said Skelton so lying , he the said Stevens did divers Times strike and kick , giving her then and there , on the Head , Face , Stomach . Belly and Sides , several Mortal Wounds and Bruises , of which Wounds and Bruises from the 15th to the 20th of the same Month she languished and languishingly liv 'd and then and there died . He was indicted a second time on the Coroner 's Inquest for the said Murder . Hannah Smith . The Deceased died last Saturday was Six Weeks : On Monday before the Prisoner beat her and stamped on her in a violent Manner , and drag 'd her out by the Hair of her Head . I saw no Provocation given , for she was darning a Stocking , and he struck her in the Face with his Hands and Feet , and stamped upon her right Side , so violently , that there was a great deal of Blood came out of her Nose . On the Tuesday he beat her again , and stamped upon her in the Entry , drag 'd her out of the Brandy-shop , stamp 'd upon her again , and she cried out , Dear , God , save my Life , he has killed me ! Q . What Relation was the Prisoner to Skelton ? Smith . They were Bedfellows I believe . This was in Bridges-street , where he had co-habited with her three Years , I sell Oranges just by them at the Door of the Play-house . I have seen him pull her in , and lock the Door upon her , and have heard her cry out , Murder . On Wednesday I saw the Deceased , and said Katey , how came you to be so used ? and she told me , that he came up again at two a-Clock and whipt her so violently , that the Scourges were on her Face when the Coroner sat on her Body . I saw her when she was dying on Saturday Night a Quarter before 9 , and she died a quarter of an Hour before 10 . She sent Jenny Hall for me . I went and found her sitting upright in her Bed ; she said she was dying , and wished I would send f r a Minister : I am starv 'd says she , pray let me have a Gill of Wine . I sent Jenny Hall for it to the Genoa Arms . Then she desired me to go to her Father , and tell him that William Stevens had killed and murdered her ; but my Father , says she , wo n't do me Justice , I hope the World will . There was not , my Lord , a free Place , from Head to Foot , but all black as the Gentlemens Gowns . Q . Had she any Physician or Surgeon ? Smith . Yes , Mr. Coldham was sent for , after she was dead : He would not let any one come near her while she was alive . I went to Stevens , to tell him the Deceased desired to have a Minister sent for : G - d D - n Kate Skelton , say he , the Minister , and you too ; if she dies , she must be buried . This was at the Castle the Corner of Vinegar-Yard . I do believe she might be a little out of her Senses between whiles , because she told me , my Husband lay across the Feet of the Bed , and he was not there . and talk 'd of a Child burning in the Fire . Prisoner . I ask what time you saw me beat her , and whereabouts it was ? Smith . From two a-Clock to 8 a-Clock on Monday , I saw him beat her several Times in the Brandy-shop ; then she went in , there he locked her in and beat her , and she cried out , Help ! Murder ! Sarah Whitehead . I was coming by on Monday , and I went in for a Farthing 's worth of small Beer ; and while I was there , the Prisoner came in and tapp 'd her in the Face ; she said Will , do n't beat me , and then he gave her a Punch in the Eye : I believe the Blow might do her a Prejudice . Q . Was the tap in the Face given with Violence ? Whitehead . I ca n't say that ; but a Man 's Hand is heavy , I can tell that my self . Then he said , Kate come go to bed ; says I , do Kate , go up with him , and the Woman in the Shop , said fye upon you , to stand by and see a Woman beat ; why says I ; if we say any Thing he 'll beat us . She went up with him , and the next Morning she told me she was kill 'd Will . Stevens had kill 'd her ; he had laid her down and trampled upon her . On Saturday I heard she was dead , and was so surpriz 'd that I have never been myself since . I saw her after she had been dead about an Hour ; when she was laid out , and after Mr. Coldham had opened her ; her Side very black and bruised , but I can not tell which Side , and there was a Plaister on it , other Parts of her Body was much bruised , and her poor Eye sunk in her head . Prisoner . I ask if you never heard of her falling down Stairs drunk ? Whitehead . No never , I know once the Prisoner threw her down Stairs , and put-her Finger and Thumb out of joint . Ann Thomas . I went up Stairs on Friday to see the poor Creature , and ask 'd her if I should do any Thing for her ; she desired me to get her half a Pint of Beer . I did , and made it hot , with Sugar and Nutmeg : I am afraid said I , that the Fellow has murdered you Mrs. Thomas . Says she . I am not long for this World , then the World will see this , when I am dead ; and on Saturday she died . I was there when she was dead , and pull 'd the Plaister off her Side , and there was not a free Place from the Crown of her Head to the Sole of her Feet , all black as a Shoe , and the Stripes in her Fore-head were as big as my little Finger ; both Sides were black , but the right side was blackest . About a Month before , I saw her Arms whaled as thick as a Cane ; I have seen him beat her so , that I thought no Christian Creature could have lived . About half an Hour before she died , I says to her , Katey , do you want any Thing ? Will Stevens was hanging over her , and he said you want something under your Head ; and he put her Petticoat behind her Head ; there is no Occasion for it now , says she . I saw her after she was dead , and never saw the Fellow of her in my life . Susan Turner . I was coming through the Play-house Passage on Saturday Night , and the Prisoner was standing there . I asked him how she did ; he said very bad , and told me I might go up to see her . Jenny Hill was with her ; her hands were very cold and she in a clammy Sweat . She told me she was very bad , and that she had desired Stevens to get her some Small-beer ; but he not coming , I made her half a Pint of Sage Tea . The Woman in the Room help 'd me to get her up , and we made her Bed , and aired her Sheets , and got her to Bed again , for she told us she was very faint . When she was got to bed , she put her Hands round my Wast , gritted her Teeth , and with a very low Voice , said he had killed her . After she was dead , I saw a Plaister on her Right-side , and her Body was all over Bruises . I believe she was now and then not in her Senses , for she told me , that Jenny Hall had bepissed her self , and talked of a Child burning . She died with her Head in my Bosom . Margaret Rialton . On Sunday Night she came to my Room , and begged I would let her sit up there that Night , for Stevens had threatned to murder her ; this about a Month before . I said , Kitty , be persuaded and go home : if I go home , says she , he will murder me . On Tuesday she came again , and said , Will . had beat her with a Broom stick , which he made her fetch out of the Closet , and broke her Arm , and put out her Finger . I said you are a Fool to live with him , you are not married to him ; Aye , says she , it is fine talking , if I should go home to my Fathers , he will get me away again ; he has threatned to murder me , but he need not do any thing more , he has done enough already . When she was dead , one came and told me that Kate Plump was gone ; with that I ran and met the Prisoner with a full Pot of Beer upon the Stairs . I viewed her Body ; her Right-side and Shoulder were very black , and her left Eye , and her right Finger and Arm . Mary Griffiths . On Monday Morning she was waiting in my Shop for Stevens ; when he came in , she desired him to go to bed , for he had been up all Night : He bid her get up Stairs , and gave her some Blows , not very unmercifull , about the Head , but she got a black Eye : I told him , if he must abuse the Woman , he must take her up Stairs . I saw no more Blows , nor did I hear her cry out ; they went up Stairs together . On Tuesday Morning , she had two Strokes on the Forehead , and a black Eye . I had been ill , and the Deceased looked after me . ( Dr. Coldham was my Surgeon , ) and I was afraid he had beat her for being with me ; but she told me no , Griffiths , I wont belie him , he is not against my doing good to any one . The next Day she fell before the Fire , and told me her Pains were too great to bear . I asked her what occasioned her Pains ; and she told me , they who laid her out would see how she had been used by him . Mr. Coldham . About the latter end of March , the Church Wardens of Covent Garden Parish sent to me , to desire me to open the Deceased . I viewed the Body , and saw several Bruises on her Arms and Sides ; I cut into them , and found they went no farther than the Fat , so they could not be mortal . On opening the Body , I found both the Lobes of the Lungs adhered to the Breast , and in the right Lobe was formed a large Ulcer , with a Collection of Matter ; the Liver was of a parboil 'd Complection , and larger than ordinary , the Stomach much diminished , and the Tone entirely lost . I believe the Occasion of her Death was from a Complication of Disorders occasioned by irregular living . Mr. Hicks . I assisted Mr. Coldham , and am of the same Opinion . Jane Hill . I was with her two Days before she died , and never heard her complain ; she was never easy when he was away from her . Elizabeth Cooling . I was with her the Night she died , and did not hear any thing of her being murdered . Several Persons giving the Prisoner the Character of an honest , quiet Man , and others deposing that the Deceased was excessively addicted to drinking , the Jury acquitted the Prisoner , and found on the Coroner 's Inquest , that Catherine Skelton died a natural Death . 41.

I had a suspicion of these People ; they had lived in the Neighbourhood 2 or 3 Days , and Daniel Malden came on the Sunday to me for a Shirt , a Shift , and an Apron , which I had to wash for him and his Wife ; and I observed him to walk several times backward and forward , viewing ( I suppose ) which way he might get in .

John Banford . Malden own 'd to me in the Lodge at Newgate , that he broke open Henshaw 's House , and said he could help me to some of the Linnen again ; Holbert , he said , was concerned with him in this Fact .

The Stable belongs to Mr. Armitstead : I saw him go three Times , about 8 o'Clock at Night the 6th of March ; and the Second Time he went in , I heard a Noise , saw a Flash like the Noise and Flash of a Gun : he came out , and went back again , shut the Stable Door and I saw no more of him . I was the first Person that saw the Fire in the Stable , and the Smoke coming out of the Windows ; it was about half a quarter of an Hour after I saw the Flash and heard the Noise . I ran in Doors , ( for I was sitting at a Shop in the Inn-Yard ) and cry 'd out Fire ; and when I came out the Flames flared out of the Windows . James Rathall .

He had a long Beard , and it was very much sing 'd as were his Eye-lashes , which was done by the Flashing of the Powder in his Face . He could give no Account why he did it . Will . Harrison . I am Engineer to the Hand in Hand Fire-Office : The Prisoner used to go out with the Engine : He came down and told me , the Bell-Inn in Warwick-Lane was on Fire : I ask 'd him if it was a Chimney , ( for I was loth to put the Company to Charge without asking ) and he told me he saw the Stable all in Flames before he came away .

They had been about a Week in my House When she made this Declaration ; indeed she never told me afterwards that she was married . Council . Did any Body visit her while she liv 'd in your House ?

One Mrs. Savage in Mark Lane paid me for her Lodging , and Board . The latter Part of the Time she was with me , she was sick , and was to go into the Hospital ; I asked him ( the Prisoner ) who was to be at the Charge of it ? he would he said , if I would pay the Money , for he would not be blown for the World .

In the Beginning of this Affair with Fast , I lived at the Bull in Spratt Bottom , and had about 40 or 50 l. This Arabella Fast used frequently to come to the House : We soon became acquainted , and she told me , she had something to offer me ; if I was in my own Interest , I would embrace it : There is , says she , a Minister , ( naming his Name ) who often lies with me , and if you 'll say you are my Husband , we may get some Money out of him , I thought 'twould be no more Harm in me to say the Words , than for him to do the Deed ; so I came up to London to take a Room for her as my Wife : I brought in this Arabella , and lay with her myself ; and while I was in Town , willing to be getting something , I got employed at the Three Artichoaks . Within a Fortnight after our coming to Town , she told me the Parson was come to London , and now was the Time to make him our Prize : Come into our Room , says she , about 10 o'Clock at Night . I did , and found Arabella and he abed . Hey ! says I , how came you to be abed with my Spouse , and I called up Mr . Marshal to bear Witness . Sir , says he , I only lay with her to keep my Back warm : O Sir , says I , if she has kept your Back warm , you have kept her Belly warm : However , the Gentleman lay with her all Night , and in the Morning he asked for the Certificate of our Marriage : I must make you a Present , says he , if you can produce a Certificate . I knew not what to say , Guilty Conscience needs no Accuser . Sir , says Arabella , we were married at the Fleet ; and , says she to me , for a Crown , I can get a Certificate from thence . I gave her a Crown , and in half an Hour she brings me a Certificate . I can call People to my Character . C.

Mr. Greaves , of Council with the King , open 'd the Indictment , and Mr. Attorney General open 'd the Evidence in a very eloquent Speech . Then the Reverend Mr. John Wilson was call 'd , and the Charter of the University , was produced and read . Justice . No one has prov 'd that Charter : They should be obliged to shew that Trinity College was incorporated by Letters Patent : there is no time mentioned in the Indictment when it was incorporated : And as Mr. Attorney General has opened the Indictment , they should produce the Warrant , by Virtue of which they seized the Books . Council . What Book is that in your Hand Sir ? Wilson . This is , Opus novum Gildas Britannus Monachus , cui Sapientis Cognomentum est inditum de Calamitate excidio & Cononeila Britaniac , quam Angliam nane vocant , author vetustus , a multis diu desideratus & nuper in Gratiam D. Cuthberti Tonstalli Londinen . Episcopi formulis excusus . Justice . Is that the whole Title of the Book ? Wilson . 'T is all that is in the Indictment . Justice . Read the whole Title of the Book : Is it in the Indictment ? Council for the Prisoner . We have an Objection to make to all the Books on this Account : In the Indictment they say Triate Col. C. K. 'T is so in the Charter . 'T is not necessary to set forth every Thing that is mentioned in the Title Page ; for the Description of the Book and the Title Page , are two different Things . The Title is set forth , tho ' what giveth an Account of the Contents of the Book be omitted . Wilson . The next is intituled , Literarum quibus invictissimus Princeps Henricus Octavus Rex Angliae et Franciae , Dns Hiberniae ac Fidei Defensor , respondit ad quandam Epistolam Martini Lutheri ad se missam , et ipsius Lutheranae quoq ; Epistolae Exemplum , value 5 s. in the Indictment . C. P. How is Dominus spelt there ? Wilson . Dns . C. K. 'T is not material , tho ' there be a Contraction in one Place , and the whole Word be set forth in another . C. K. What was the Value of the first Book ? Wilson . 'T is a curious scarce Book , that Gildas ; it has , I know , been sold for 10 s. a curious Man would give more : I value this at a Crown . C. K. What is the Worth of Luther ? Wilson . Half a Crown . Justice . What , worth Half a Crown , and imperfect ? C. K. Make some Allowance , if there be a Leaf wanting . Wilson . 'T is worth Half a Crown still I believe . C. K. Go to the next Sir . Wilson . This is Gulielmi Postelli Baren . Doleriensis de Onginibus seu de Hebraicae Linguae & Gentis Antiquitate ; deque variarum Linguarum affinitate Liber . Justice . Does the Title end there ? C. Yes , this Title ends at Liber . Justice . I beg to look at that Book . C. K. What 's the Value of this Book ? Wilson . One Shilling . C. K. What is the next , Sir ? Wilson . I will take them in Order . The next is Pyramidographia , or a Description of the Pyramid in Egypt , by John Greaves . The Indictment mentions four Tracts bound up together ; we found them separate as they are now ; but I remember them bound up together in the Library : I remember them particularly . . If they were in the Library bound up together , and have afterwards been separated , they may be said to be one Book , containing four Tracts : Pulling off the Cover alters not the Thing at all . Justice . I ask whether or no these Books at the Time of finding the Indictment , and taking them from me , were then in one Book as laid in the Indictment . Can Mr. Wilson say they were bound all together when they were taken ? Wilson . I can not say they were . But I had them at my Chamber bound all together ; and I lent them to the Master of Pembroke bound all together ; and there 's an Account of the four Parts wrote upon a Leaf , which I do n't find now . Charles Mason . I remember they were bound together , but I ca n't be certain whether these Tracts were the 4 that were bound in this very Cover ; but I remember , a Scholar desired he might have the Use of it , and I got it from the Master of Pembroke , and lent it him , and returned it to the Library about 3 Months before Mr. Justice went away ; when I returned it , they were all bound together in a brown Calf-Skin Cover . Another Witness . That was the Book that was lent to the Master of Pembroke , and I remember the Tracts were bound up in a brown Cover . C. K. What were the Tracts contain 'd in that Book ? C. Mason . Pyramidographia , or a Description of the Pyramids of Egypt ; a Discourse o the Roman Foot and Denarius , by John Greaves Jacobi Usserii Armachani Macedonici Asianorum Anno Solari Dissertatio Graecorum Astronomorum Parapemateiad Macedonici & Juliani Anni Rationes accommodato , and Roberti Stephani Notae Novum Testamentum . This last was an imprfect Piece . C. K. What is the Value of the Pyramids ? Wilson . I asked the Price of that , and I could not get one under 10 s. 6 d. The Deescription of the Pyramids , and the Discourse of the Roman Foot are reckoned very curious Piece C. K. What is Usher 's Book worth ? Wilson . About 18 d. Stephanus is imp , is worth 6 d. I believe . Justice . If I mind the Indictment right , it says , Book containing 4 Tracts ; the Pyramids and Roman Foot : Usher & Robertus Stephanus in Novum Testamentum . C. K. The different Tracts have been mentioned : and here is the Stephanus . Wilson . The next is an Epitaph of D. Edmund Bonner : declaring the Life and End of D. Edmund Bonner : And another made by a Papist , in Praise of D Edmund Bonner , and set up in Paul 's Cross : Also a Reply to a scandalous Lie cast abroad in Defence of D. Edmund Bonner The Value I believe is 1 Shilling , and Authores rei venaticae antiqui cum Commentariis Jam Ulitii ad Christinam Augustam . C. K. What is the next Book ? Wilson . De Francicae Linguae recta pronunciatione Theodoro Beza Auctore . C. K. What is the Value of this ? Wilson . One Shilling I believe Sir . C. K. While they are looking for the next Book , I will ask you Sir , whether you believe all these belong to Trinity College Library ? Wilson . I believe they do : The next is Bonner 's Articles , but they are not at hand : The next is , La Bibliotheque D ' Antoine du Verdier Seigneur de Vauprivas : This was found in Mr. Justice 's Bureau , and has Trinity College Arms upon it . We can prove the Book to belong to the Library . C. K. Mr. Hutchinson , had you such a Book in the Library ? Hutchison . It is now missing from the Library ; it was there within these 2 Years . C. K. Mr. Wilson , when did you see this Book there ? Wilson . I know by the Catalogue there was such a Book there , I ca n't remember I have seen it : 'T is not now in the Class referr 'd to in the Catalogue ; here is the Arms of the College upon it . C. P. I would ask whether Books may not often be misplaced in the Library , and put into an improper Class ? Wilson . 'T is possible , but not commonly so . C. P. I would ask whether the Books in the Library are chain 'd ? Wilson . No . they are not . C. P. Are they all loose ? Wilson . Yes : and any of the Fellows have Liberty to borrow a Book . C. K. What is the Value of the Book , of which that Leaf was the Title ? Wilson . About 10 s. C. K. What is the next ? Wilson . The next is , Jacobi Sadoleti de laudibus Philosophiae , Libri duo . And the Value of this is 2 s. The next is , D. Camerarius de Fortitudine , Doctrina & Pietate Scotorum : The Title is wanting : The current Title begins with the Words Introductio Generalis . C. P. Then this is not in the Indictment . C. K. We can put it by ; we have enough without it . What is the next ? Wilson . La Methode nouvelle & Invention extraordinaire de dresser les Chevaux les travailler selon la Nature & parfair la Nature par la Subtilite de Part ; la quelle n ' a jamaisete trouvee que par le tres noble haut & tres puissant Prince Guillaume , Marquis & Comptede Newcastle . I know not the Value of this myself , but I have known some Gentlemen have given 10 l. for it . Justice . Let me see the Book : I know it very well : I know not whether 't is material or not , but Newcastle is imperfect ; here is one Leaf paged 5. and the next Leaf is 7 . C. K. How come you to know this so suddenly ? Justice . I own the Book was found in my Chamber . Wilson . The next is Notitia Monastica , or a short History of the Religious Houses in England and Wales , by Thomas Tanner . C. K. What is the Value of that ? Wilson . About a Guinea ; 't is a very scarce Book . The next is D.Junii Juvenalis Satyrae ; the Louvre Edition : I have seen it valued in a Catalogue at 10 or 12 s. C. K. Go to the next , Sir . Wilson . The next is sacrae Scripturae veteris noviq ; Testa mentiomnia . This is an Aldus Edition , a very valuable Book , worth three orfour Guineas . C. K. What is the next ? Wilson . I quattro Libri dell ' Architettura di Andrea Palladio , the value of this is one Guinea or a Guinea and half . The next is Les Memoires de Messire Philippe de Comines , Seigneur d'Argenton ; the Paris Edition , Value 1 l. 1 s. C. K. Pray go to the next , Sir . Wilson . The next are three Volumes . The first is , Prima Pars Romanae Urbis Topograhiae & Antiquitatum ; and all the Volumes consist of two Parts . The 2d Part is , Secunda Pars Antiquitatum Romanorum seu Topographia Romanae Urbis . C. P. The Title is not compleat in the Indictment , the Title of the Book ends at Accuratissine , and not at Antiquitatum . C. K. I believe it is so ; lay them by . Wilson . The next is , Addenda to the Statutes at large . C. P. All the Title here too , is not in the Indictment . ( This was laid by likewise ) . Wilson . The next in the Indictment , is , the Statutes at Large , beginning , & c. C. P. You have not all the Title ; 't is only the Statutes at Large , in the Indictment . This was laid by also . Wilson . The next is the French Plutarch : Les Vies des Hommes illustres Grecs & Romains comparees l'une avec l'autre , par Plutarch de Chaeronee ; it is worth two Guineas . The next is Quinti Horatij Flacci a Louvre Horace , worth about a Guinea . The next is an English Field 's Bible . The Title is , The Holy Bible , consisting the Books of the Old and New Testament . C. K. What is the Value ? Wilson . Twenty Guineas , both of them . C. K. What is the next ? Wilson . The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacrements , and other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of England ; with the Psalter or Psalms of Devil . This and the other I value at twenty Guineas . C. K. Go on , Sir . Wilson . This is Godefridi Bidleo , Medicinae Doctoris & Chiruurgi Anantomia Humani Corporis . C. P. This is a Copper-Plate ; and not set forth right in the Indictment . Wilson . The next is , De Bello Belgico Decas prima Famianae Stradae , Rom . Soc . Jesu . I value the two Vols . at a Guinea , they are worth more . The next is , Vetus Testamentum multiplici Lingua nune primo impressum : & imprimis Pentatenchus Hebraico Greco atq ; Chaldaico Idiomate , adjuncta unicuiq ; sua Latina Interpretatione : Here are four Volumes , and this is the Complatensian Edition , worth about twenty Guineas . Mr. Richardson . The next is the Aeschylus ; but while we were in Mr. Justice 's Chamber , that was convey 'd away . ( The Council for the King , did not think proper to take up any more Time in proving the Books , but went to the Fact . ) C. K. Do you remember that Gildas to have been in the Library ? Wilson . I can not say I do ; but there is a particular mark on it , by which we know it to be ours . We found many of our Books in the Library defac 'd : Prints taken out of curious Books , some of which were found at Mr. Justice 's , and made a Report to the College of what we found there . C. K. Give an Account how this was discovered . Wilson . 'T is known ( I suppose ) that there was a Report of the Temple Library being robb 'd ; this gave us a Suspicion that the Libraries with us had suffered likewise . On that Occasion we examined Trinity Library , and found many Books wanting , and many defaced . The Vice-Chancellor then commissioned the Register to consult Lawyers , that we might know what was proper to be done : And according to their Advice , Mr. Allen , Mr. Hutchenson our Librarian , and my self , were sent up in January last , to take the Direction of Council , in order to our proceeding further in this Business : We waited on Mr. Baron Thomson , and he gave us a Search-Warrant : We search 'd Mr. Justice 's Chambers , and there we found all the Books that have now been produced in Court . C. K. Is there any Marks on that Book by which you know it to be yours ? Wilson . I found several Tracts taken out of books of Miscellanies : These I laid aside , and gave Account of them to the College : Mr. Jackson examined the Library particularly , and found this Volume in my Hand with the Tracts cut out . King Henry the Eighth 's Answer to Luther was cut out of this Book : Upon the Leaves of it ( 23 ) being marked , the Belly of the 3 was wanting : And this very Tract we found in his Chambers , and putting it in that part of the Volume , from whence it had been taken , it tally 'd exctly , and made up exactly the Figure 3 , which before was deficient ; and this Volume I had out of the Library Mr. Jackson . The Gildas was cut out likewise of another Volume . On the Inside of the Binding there is a Catalogue of the Tracts contained therein ; this was wanting and was found at Mr. Justice 's Chambers . It comes in , in the same Order , as mentioned in the Catalogue , the Colour of the Leaves is the same , and it tallies exactly : And for a farther Confirmation there is the Coll . Arms upon it . There is another Tract wanting , which we ca n't find ; but we have got the College Catalogue , which mentions every one of them : this was Numb . 32 . C. K. Is it a Manuscript Catalogue ? Jackson . Yes , Sir . Justice . I submit it to the Court , whether that Catalogue should not be proved by somebody who has compared the Books in the Library with the Catalogue ; otherwise the Catalogue can be of no Service : Besides , how does it appear that these Books ever were in the Library . C. K. What , must we bring a Man to prove a Catalogue , that was wrote , perhaps , a Hundred Years ago ? Jackson . I believe it to be a true Catalogue : I found the Volume , out of which these Tracts were taken , by the Help of Catalogue . C. K. I would ask you Sir , whether as far as you have compared it , it is always been found agreeable to the Books . Jackson . As far as I have observed , 't is an accurate Catalogue . C. K. Have you often seen him in the Library ? Wilson . I have often seen him there last Summer , but never observed what he was doing ; he came from College in October ( I think . ) He entered himself a Gentleman Commoner , in August was two Years . C. K. Was the Postellus Hebraicae Linguae in the Library ? Jackson . By Mr. Wilson 's giving an Account of the Tract , I found the Volume in which it was bound , in the Library thus mutilated : the Tract was missing : here is a Catalogue of the Tracts in the Book , and putting this in its Place , from whence it was cut , it fitteth exactly : and the College Arms are upon it . We found it in Mr. Justice 's Chamber . Justice . I acknowledge all this ; 't is all true ; but I would - C. K. Do n't confess what you should not . Did not you take this Book from Trinity College ? Justice . I ca n't say that I - But before I was sent to Newgate , I would ask Mr. Wilson , whether I did not own to you Mr. Wilson ( Here Mr. Justice burst into Tears , and when he had composed himself , he went I would ask whether I did not own I had a great Number of Trinity College Books : Did not I own it , before I was taken up by Warrant from Baron Thomson ? Did not I acknowledge it ? Did not I give you up the Key of my Chambers , that you might take them ? Wilson . We had some Conversation with you , and you did say you had many Books belonging to Trinity , and you did say we might take them ; but it was thought adviseable not to do so , as there were Warrants out . We were advised to proceed regularly , by Warrant from Mr. Baron Thomson . Mr. Justice . And when you found them in my Chamber , were not many of them directed to my Tutor ? Was not Professor Taylor my Tutor ? Was there not two Boxes of Books packed up and directed to Professor Taylor ? And was there not in one of them , a Letter to him ? Q . When was it you searched Mr. Justice 's Chambers and found the Books ? Wilson . It was on the Monday . Mr. Justice did say on the Saturday we might take the Books , but we did not obtain the Search-Warrant till Monday . Mr. Justice was in Custody when the two Boxes were packed up , and had been in the Custody of the Constable three Days , at the Bolt and Tun . C.K . Were the Books pack 'd up before or after Notice was sent to Cambridge ? Wilson . After . Justice . I admit I had a great Number of these Books , and that a great many of them belong to Trinity College : I was so far from altering them or defacing them , that the Arms of the College are in many of them to this Hour . I would not give the Court trouble , I admit them all , and never did deny it . C.K . Which Books were in the Boxes , and which were not packed up ? Wilson . Juvenal was in one of the Boxes ; The Aldus Bible , Palladio , the Complut . Bible , the Statutes at Large , the French Plutarch , the Paris Horace , Field 's Bible and Common-Prayer , and Strada , were in Boxes . Justice . Was there not more in the Boxes than are in the Indictment ? Wilson . Yes ; Gildas was not packed up , that we found in his Chamber . Henry the 8th 's Answer to Luther , Postellus , Beza de Francicae Pronunciationis , Newcastle 's Horsemanship , were not packed up : Greaves 's Pyramids , the Account of the Roman Foot , Sadeletus , Bonner 's Epitaphs , Authores reivenatica , these were not pack'd-up ; there are more mentioned in the Indictment , but you have not gone thro ' them , so they have not come before you . C.K . Were any of the Tracts taken out of the Volumes packed up ? Wilson . No , none of them . Justice . Have you done with Mr. Wilson ? I would ask him , whether it is not usual to give Pupils leave to take what Books they have occasion for ? Mr. Wilson is a Tutor himself . Wilson . It is ; to take them regularly sending a Note , Permit such a one to take such a Book , and place it to my Account : None of these were placed to Mr. Taylor 's Account . Justice . I would ask whether you remember where my Chambers were ? Wilson . I remember where you liv 'd last . Justice . I would ask you , how far 't is between the Library and my Chamber ? Wilson . The Library is at some Distance . Justice . Is it not quite cross both the great Courts ? Wilson . 'T is not so : Your Chamber is in the first Court , and the Library is by the River . Justice . I would ask how 't is possible for any one to carry them away unseen ? How came I by this Privilege ? Wilson . That you best know . C.K . Do you give leave to any but Members of the College to take Books ? Wilson . No . Justice . And in what Capacity was I ? Wilson . A Fellow Commoner . Justice . What are the Privileges of Fellow Commoners ? Wilson . They sit at the Fellows Table , and take the other Advantages that Fellows have ; they have no Right to take Books ad libitum . You have a Right to take a Book if your Tutor gives leave , and 't is placed to his Account . Fellow-Commoners we look on as Boarders ; they are no part of the Corporation , and have no Right to take Books without this Licence . Just There are two sorts of Scholars : A Foundation Scholar , who lives on the Stipend of the College ; and one who pays for what they have , and are at their own Expence : Do n't you look on a Student as a Scholar ? did not I on my Admission pay a Guinea , or a Guinea and a half , according to the Custom of the College ( as you do ) to the Library Keeper . Wilson . 'T is paid upon Admission . Justice . Can you swear these Books were all taken in London ? Wilson . They were taken in your Chambers . C.P . I asked before , whether there was any Fastening to these Books ? Wilson . None , in Trinity College Library . Justice . You say , that Tutors licence their Pupils to take Books , and they are entered by Order of the Tutor in the Register Book . Now I would ask you , Sir , whether it is not a frequent Practice to borrow Books without making such Entry ? Wilson . I have something to do with Pupils my self . I write , Let such a Person have such a Book , and place it to my Account . C. P. You are a cautious Man . I would ask whether any Body can go into the Library without the Librarian 's Leave . Wilson . 'T is not always open : There are Hours when the Keeper attends . When a Gentleman studies there , he has leave of a Fellow . A Fellow Commoner of a House is indulged with leave to study there ; but he ca n't take them to his Chamber without his Tutor 's Note . C.P . I would ask whether any one can go into the Library without leave of the Librarian ? Wilson . When any come to see the Library , the Librarian walks with the Person : If he comes to study ; he has leave to sit down . Justice . Has it not been common for Books to be wanting in Trinity College Library ? Wilson . There are many Books out : Because Fellows , according to their particular Studies , have particular Books . I have some ; Mr.Taylor has some . C.P . Ask him if they do n't keep them 20 or 30 Years ? And if they do n't bring them away with them to London ? Wilson . If they do , they should not . C.P . I ask if you do n't know of Books belonging to Trinity , now in London ? Wilson . There are a great many here now . I know but of a Volume of Stillingfleet beside , and that is charged on his Head ; he is a Fellow , and is now in Court . Justice . Who is the under Library-Keeper ? Wilson . The present Man 's Name is Harris , he is about 18 Years old . Justice . In relation to a Fellow Commoner , I would ask whether they have not more Privileges than other Graduates . Wilson . We allow you to go into the Library to study there , not on any other account . Justice . Are not Fellow Commoners looked upon as superior to Scholars ? Wilson . Yes . - Justice . What do you mean by a Fellow Commoner ? Wilson . One who sits at the same Table with Fellows , and enjoys their Conversation . C. P. Pray does Mr. Justice 's Name still continue in the Buttery Book ? When did you see it last there ? Wilson . His Name was on the Buttery Boards in October , whether it is now taken off or not , I can not tell . C. P. Is it not usual for a Fellow Commoner to have the Liberty of taking a Book without a Note from the Tutor ? C. K. And I would ask if he knows they are allowed to take them , not only out of the Library , but out of Cambridge . C. P. Have you , every time any of your Pupils have wanted a Book , given them a Note ? Wilson . Yes . C. K. I would ask whether in all your Time , you ever knew leave given to any Body to cut a Treatise out of a Book , carry it away , and leave the rest behind ? Wilson . No . Mr. Brounker sworn . C. K. Do you know where Mr. Justice 's Chambers are ? Brounker . In London , in Elm Court . We reckon all the east part of Temple-lane to be in London . Take a Line from Sheer-Lane , and run it down to the Water-side , all on this side the Line we reckon in London . All on this Side the Middle-Temple-Lane we call London . New Court and the Garden is called Middlesex . E'm-Court is on this side of Middle-Temple-Lane . Mr. Atkinson , the Constable was sworn . C. K. Had you any Search Warrant brought you ? Atkinson . Yes ; It was signed by Baron Thomson . ( The Warrant being proved was read ) C. K How did you proceed upon this ? Atkinson . As I am a City Constable , I did not care to serve it in the Temple without leave from the Benchers . I had leave , and with Esquire Taylor , and Mr. Brounker , we found these Books , which I have had in Custody ever since . We took Mr. Justice in his Chambers , and carried him before Baron Thomson on the Wednesday , who asked him Questions , and told him he hoped he could give a good account how he came by them : He said , he thought he could : and the Baron gave him 3 Days to do it in : I was ordered to keep the Books , and he had leave to go at liberty from Wednesday to Saturday : I was ordered to bring him again before the Baron , on Saturday . and he then not giving a good Account how he came by them , he was order 'd to get Bail , and 'till he could find Bail , he was to remain in my Custody ; I kept him at my House 'till Monday , then I took him again before Baron Thomson , and he committed him . C. K. Do you know any thing about his packing up Books ? Atkinson . Yes . On Sunday in the Evening he desired I would let him go to his Chambers , to put some Papers in order . I went with him , and he then packed up these Books in order to send them to Cambridge , and put in a Letter to one Mr. Taylor I believe : When the Books were packed up , he went home with me again . Justice . I do n't know whether your Lordship understood him as I do : I think he said , when he came with the Warrant to my Chambers , he found these Books here , or else he speaks of another Parcel of Books . Atkinson . I do n't know whether the Books that are here are the same Books that you pack 'd up . Justice . Did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant ? Atkinson . No . Justice . I ask you who it was that pressed you to execute the Warrant ? Atkinson . I believe his Name was Kinaston . Justice . There was a second Warrant granted . When was that ? before or after the packing up of the Books ? Atkinson . The Books were packed up , before the second Warrant was granted . Justice . There was no Warrant against me then for Trinity College . Mr. John Taylor . I am a Fellow of St. John 's . Justice . I beg leave to say one Thing ; I have an Objection to the Gentleman 's Evidence ; it will appear that he was Under Librarian , and had the Care of the University Library . Taylor . I received Orders from the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge ; about Christmas last , to procure a Warrant to search Mr. Justice 's Chambers : Baron Thomson granted a Warrant on the 6th of January . On the 7th they were searched , and Mr. Justice taken before the Baron . I saw some Books which were missing in the Library : On Saturday Morning he was before him again , and then he was put into the Constable 's Hands ; and on Sunday Night I was informed that Mr. Justice was packing up Books : I went to him and asked him the Reason of his packing the Books up ; he said , he was advised to do it , but that it was contrary to his own Judgment . C. K. How came the Gentlemen of Trinity to suspect Mr. Justice ? Taylor . The Gentlemen desired me in my Search for the University Library , to look for Newcastle 's Horsemanship ; I saw it in Mr. Justice 's Chambers , and sent them word of it . Justice . When you came to search , was not my Study Door lock 'd ? Taylor . Yes . Justice . When I gave you the Key , did you find any of the Books mentioned in the Warrant ? Taylor . No . Justice . My Lord , when they came to my Chambers , tho ' my Name was not in the Warrant , yet I freely let them search , and they found none of the Books mentioned in the Warrant . There was a Trunk that was lock 'd ; I opened it , and there was nothing there that they wanted . I will go farther , to shew how willing I was to give Satisfaction , I let Mr. Taylor and Mr. Brounker the next Day search , even my very Cellar , without Constable or Warrant . On their second coming , they found me at Liberty , and my Doors open , and they ca n't say there was any Obstruction to their searching . Taylor . There were some Covers of Books in the Cellar . ( The Council for the King rested the Evidence here , and the Prisoner was called on to make his Defence . Justice . My Lord , I acknowledge , as I always did , and have now done , that I had the Books . I apprehend , I had Authority to take them . First , a General Authority to take what Books I wanted , out of the Library . Secondly , An Authority in my own Right , as a Scholar of the College ; and if this appears , this Matter will be so far from being Felony , that it ca n't be a Trespass . I intended to return them , and this may appear from my declaring that I had them , delivering up my Keys , and packing them up before the Warrant for the College-Books was granted . There was no Warrant against me for the College-Books , before I endeavoured to send them away . As to the Matter of my being a Scholar ; it will appear from the Statutes , there are two sorts of Scholars . From the Statute 25 Sept. 12 . Eliz . where 't is said , Nullus Scholaris quicunq ; & c From this Statute it appears , that there are stipendiary Scholars , who receive Money or Victuals , who are supported by the College , and Scholars who live at their own Expence ; of which Number I am one : And if any Doubt arises on that , I hope these Gentlemen ( my Council ) will be permitted to argue for me . But I apprehend , if I had no Right as a Scholar of the College , yet I hope this Clause in the 2d of Eliz . Chap . 14. which says , Omnes Scholasticos , & c. will give me the Right of a Fellow . I beg leave to observe , that the constant Word in all Statutes and Chapters , when a Scholar is spoken of , is Scholaris : A Foundation-Scholar is called Discipulus , and I must be the Scholaris . The Pensionaries are the Stipendiaries of the College . Fellow-Commoners have always the same Privileges with Fellows . My Lord , I was so far from secreting these Books , that 't is intirely owing to the Negligence of a Child , whom they have made Library-Keeper , that my Name was not entered with the Books , according to my Order . But if I had not ordered them to be entered , yet by the Statutes it can not be a Felony . They lay openly in my Room ; they have the College Arms on them , and have particular Marks : Could any body ( intending to secret them ) be so mad , as to let them lie about openly , with these Marks . There were many Books I intended to send down , before there were any Complaints against me , but they would not suffer me . I had a Message from my Tutor , to inform me , he thought it proper I should send down the Books I had , belonging to the Library , which I had from him . I sent him word , I hoped I should spend my Christmas with him , then all the Books should be put in order ; but this Affair happening , prevented my going , or sending the Books . There is something appears in my Behalf from the very Face of these Books . My Chambers were in the Corner of the first Court , and the Library in the Corner of the other great Court ; I appeal to any Man , whether it was possible for any one to carry these great Books , ( and some there are which are much bigger ) out of the Library to my Chambers without Discovery ; here are these Bibles , and Plutarch 's Lives ; the Thing speaks itself ; 't is impossible to remove these Books in a clandestine Manner . But , my Lord , I never was there , but the Boy , the Library-Keeper , was with me : He is a negligent Boy , and , I believe , 't is no Wonder that Books should be lost from Trinity Library . When I was at College there was 15 or 1600 Books wanting , and must I be answerable for their Neglect , and be subject to Punishments and Indictments ? I hope your Lordship does not think it necessary for me to call any Manner of Evidence ; the Books are the Books of the Master , Fellows , and Scholars and I am a Scholar , consequently the Books I have a Right in , and they will be as much mine as theirs , therefore it can not be Felony : If they have been carried away , it can not be feloniously . I desire my Council may be heard . But it not being proved that Mr. Justice was a Member of the Corporation , his Objection was over ruled . Justice . I would ask Mr . Professor Taylor if he did not give Directions to the Library-Keeper , that I should have what Books I wanted . Taylor . Yes , I gave Orders that Mr. Justice should have what Books he had occasion for . Justice . You are Greek Professor Sir , and was my Tutor : Is it not an usual Method for Tutors to give Orders , that their Pupils may have what Books they want ? Taylor . 'T is not very common ; but as Mr. Justice was a Gentleman , I indulged him . Justice . I would know whether Fellow Commoners are not indulged with particular Privileges ? Taylor . We make some Distinction to be sure : They sit among Masters of Arts at Church , and in the publick Schools . Justice . Do n't they frequently attend the Schools ? Taylor . Yes . Justice . What do you take a Scholar to be in Trinity College ? Taylor . They have about 14 l. a Year allowed them . Q . Do you take Fellow Commoners to be Part of the Corporation ? Taylor . 'T is taken in the College that they are not . Justice . I desire to know if 't is not taken in the College , that there are two sorts of Scholars , and the general Name for them is Scholaris , and that is , because they attend the Schools ; do n't Fellow Commoners attend the Schools ? Taylor . Yes , and take Degrees as others do . Justice . There are Scholars in the College who have Pensions , and many others who have not : Well , Sir , I would know the Custom and Practice of the University : There is a Jurisdiction by some of the Charters , granted to the Chancellor , Master and Scholars . Taylor . Yes , Sir . Justice . If I had Money owing me , or owed Money , where must I sue , or where might I be sued ? Taylor . In the Vice-Chancellor 's Court . Justice . Why so ? Taylor . 'T is always the Way . Q . Suppose a Gentleman at Trinity is not matriculated , how is it then ? Justice . The very same Thing . Taylor . This Question was never asked in any Suit in the University Courts , whether a Man was matriculated or not . C. K. Your suing and being sued , is as you are a Member of the University , not as you are a Member of a College . Justice . I apprehend what I am upon is material , because in all the Charters of Colleges , Scholars , as I am , are called Scholares , and the Stipendiary Scholars are called Discipuli . As the Distinction depends upon the Charter of the University , I would make use of the Words of the Charter , to describe the two sorts of Scholars . I would ask Mr. Taylor , is not a Fellow Commoner looked upon as a Member of a College ? Taylor . He is an admitted Member ; I can not say an incorporated one . Justice . On the Admission of any one into the College , are there not Fees paid ? Taylor . Did not you pay those Fees ? Justice . I can not tell : 'T is not material , whether you or I paid them : But I would ask whether the Bed Makers have not Keys of our Chambers as well as we ? Taylor . Yes . Justice . Then if I had stolen the Books , they would easily have been discovered . But did not you about November or December , send me word , you thought it proper I should return the Books I had taken ? Taylor . Yes , I said the Library was to be review 'd , and it would be proper to replace the Books . Justice . What Answer did I send you ? Taylor . You said you should come down at Christmas , and then the Books should be replaced . Jury . We desire to know if there were any Books enter 'd in the Library-Book to Mr. Justice on Mr. Taylor 's Account ? Taylor . The last time he was at College there were some enter 'd to him . Jury . Were the Books now produced , or any of them enter 'd ? Wilson . Not one of these were enter 'd . Justice . I hope the first thing we shall go upon , will be to see whether I am a Scholar or not . Hutchinson . This is a Register of the Books lent out to the Fellows of Trinity . I am Head Library-Keeper , and keep the Book ; it always lies in the Library , and I look into it every Day . There are some enter 'd to Mr. Justice on Professor Taylor 's Head , and made Return 'd . Our Method is , when a borrow 'd Book is return 'd , the Under Library-Keeper gives a Stroke through the Name of the Book . Rhymer 's Faedera , Vol . 1 . Ashmole 's Order of the Garter , are scratched out . Justice . Mr. Taylor says , that Fellow Commoners are so far look 'd on as Scholars , that they attend the publick Schools , come to Lectures , take Degrees , and therefore I am a Scholaris . I would ask him , whether for neglect of Duty they are not punished ? Taylor . Yes , as junior Fellows are . Jury . I would ask Mr. Taylor , whether he apprehended he was regular in giving such Licence to Mr. Justice , as he says he did ? and whether when he wrote the Letter to him , he apprehended he had more Books than were entered to his Name ? Taylor . I had no suspicion that he had , at that time . C. K. Pray of whom does your Foundation consist ? What do you call your selves ? Taylor . Master , Fellows and Scholars ; a Fellow Commoner is not considered as a Fellow , nor as a Scholar . C. K. Are Fellow Commoners and Scholars chose in election ? Taylor . Those that are Scholars in the House are chosen by Election ; Fellow Commoners are not ; they are examined , but not elected , nor are they considered as Scholars of the House . A Fellow Commoner may be chosen a Fellow , but he must be chosen a Foundation Scholar first . C. K. Is there any Form of their Admittance ? Taylor . Yes , they write their own Names in a Register Book , and are sworn before the Vice-master C. K. Are there any Advancements in the Colledge ; to which if a Man be raised , it is necessary that he has been admitted a Scholar Can a Man be Master without he has been a Scholar ? Taylor . Yes ; in such Cases the King nominates . C. P. King Edward VI . gave them a Body of Statutes : and Queen Elizabeth gave them another , which are the Rule of Government ; and on one of these Statutes , if I rightly understand , Mr. Justice depends . Here the Charter of the College was referred to , which incorporated them by the Names of Magister , Socii & c Scholares . C. K. There is no Description in the Charter what a Scholar shall be . Henry VIII . when he gave this Charter reversed the Power to himself to give Statutes ; but dying without giving them , Queen Elizabeth gave these , and there is a Distinction throughout between the Socii and Scholares . Justice . In the 14th Chapter of Queen Elizabeth , you may observe the Stipendiary Scholar is called Discipulus , not Scholaris : Scholaris is another Word for Fellow . The Scholares & Socii are the constituent Parts of the Body . Common Pensioners are not elected , they take no Oath , therefore they can not be on the Foundation . Commoners are part of the Foundation , the others are no part of the Foundation ; if there be any Revenues to be divided they have no part of the Profit . Here the Statutes were read concerning the Number of , and Distinction between , the Socii Scholares and the Discipuli Scholares . C. P. I am far from saying that a Crime of this Nature is not punishable . I do not mean any such thing , nor advance any such Doctrine ; but what I would insist upon , is , whether it is not a Larceny ; punishable it is , but whether it is Felony is the Question . Justice . I believe the University-Statutes may be given in Evidence , to shew the Meaning of the Word Scholaris . I apprehend it may be material to shew there are stipendiary Scholars , and Scholars of another kind . ( Read the Statutes . ) C. K. This does not shew that Fellow-Commoners are Members of the Corporation ; here are Sociis Scholares and Discipuli Scholares , and these are all that are mentioned , and you do n't pretend to be of the Discipuli Scholares . There are to be 62 Discipuli Scholares , one of these you will not allow your self to be . Justice . No , not a stipendiary Scholar , but a Scholar in general . I desire the Statutes of Edward VI . may be produced . C. K. We had no notice of them . Here is the Charter of Henry VIII . and the Statutes of the College with relation to Fellow Commoners . There was a Dispute how far the Statutes of Edward VI . were in force ; and they are now in the Bishop of Ely 's Hands . He has the only authentick Copy of them ; it was ordered by the Privy Council that they should be put in to his Hands . Justice . I desire the 29th Chapter of Elizabeth may be read . Mr. Taylor gave a general Order for me to take what Books I had occasion for , and by Vertue of that Order , I took these ; I ordered the Boy to set them to Mr. Taylor 's Account ; 't is hardly possible I should take them secretly . Taylor . I supposed they were to be regularly enter 'd in my Name . Justice . Call Robert Marsam . ( Who was sworn . ) Marsam . I liv 'd with Mr. Justice as a Servant , about a quarter of a Year before he was taken up ; he had many Books , I can not swear to any in particular . Justice . The Books always lay about in publick , openly , and my Study-Door always unlock 'd ; a Man that had stole them feloniously , would have been fitter for Bedlam than Newgate - ( Weeps ) Do not you remember ( to Marsam ) a great large Bible lying openly ? Shew him the Book . Marsam I ca n't say that ever I saw that Book . Taylor . We found Newcastle 's Horsemanship on the Floor in the Study , without its Binding , and the Study Door was lock 'd . Marsam . I ca n't say I saw that Book . Justice . He is no Scholar , and so might not take notice of Latin and Greek Books . My Lord , I hope the Distinction as to the Scholares is plainly express 'd by Queen Elizabeth 's Statutes , and I hope it will be look 'd upon , that Scholar is a Student , and every Student a Scholar . The Council for the Prisoner very learnedly spoke to the Points in Debate , viz . Whether he was not to be considered as a Member of the Corporation . Whether a Member of a Corporation could be guilty of Felony in taking the Goods of that Corporation ; and though the Prisoner should not be prov 'd an integral or Foundation-Member ; yet considering the Liberty or Indulgence granted him , whether it would not be too hard to construct his Crime into any Species of Felony . Their Arguments were severally and distinctly answered by the Council for the King , and the whole Evidence and the Substance of the Arguments on both sides being laid before the Jury in a very judicious and learned Charge , they withdrew , and in short time return 'd , and found the Prisoner guilty . He was a second time indicted for stealing a great Number of Books to a considerable value , being the Goods and Chattels of the Chancellor , Master , and Fellows of the University of Cambridge : To which he had pleaded not Guilty : But the Jury finding him guilty of the first Indictment , he desired leave to retract his Plea , and pleaded guilty , and recommended himself to the Favour of the Court , and hoped for their Intercession to his Majesty for Mercy . On Monday Evening the 10th of May , Mr. Justice was brought down from Newgate , to receive the Judgment of the Court ; and being asked , what he had to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against him according to Law : His Answer was as follows : Justice . My Lord , In my unhappy Situation , I have nothing left , but to plead the Benefit of the Statute , and pray the Favour of the Court , that I mny not be sent abroad , for the sake of the Prosecutors . My Lord , I was so far from denying that I had the Books , that I always ackowledged it ; and I should be glad of an Opportunity of making them a farther Reparation , than they have at present . But if I am under a Necessity of going abroad , it will be absolutely impracticable . As therefore it will be more for their Interest than my own , I hope that will be considered . I speak not from any Desire I have to stay here ; for I declare , that if I was to be discharged immediately , no one should see my Face more . ( then wept ) I own I took these Things , but with no Design to keep them : And I have many more belonging to them ; which , if I must go abroad , they will never come at : Therefore , I hope , as the Law gives a discretionary Power to send abroad , or to punish at Home , by burning in the Hand , I hope for Punishment here , that I may be of Service to People with whom I have great Transactions . The Situation I have been in in Life , has occasioned my being intrusted with the Affairs of other People , and the Notice I have of my being to be sent away , is so short , 't is impossible for me to settle them , or put them into any Method , whereby they may know what Course to take . I have also a young Family to take care of ; and , I hope , for their Sake , as Justice has already had its course , and taken Place , your Lordship will think proper that Mercy should take its turn : And , indeed , it will be more Mercy to others , than myself . I have the Honour to be acquainted with many Gentlemen of the same Honourable Profession ; I am not unknown to your Lordship ; but this fatal Error has been a terrible one to me , and the Consequences of it will always lie upon me ; and has deprived me of the Profits and Satisfaction I had Reason to hope for from an Honourable Employment . Instead of being punished , by being sent abroad I beg for Punishment here , for the first Reason assigned ; viz . that I may have it in my Power to make Reparation to the People injur 'd . I never deny 'd the Books ; always acknowledged them , and took them with an honest Intent ; yet , I have been obliged to remove a great many : I ow 'd Rent to my Landlord , and was under a Necessity to send them into the Country , and afterwards to Holland ; If I am sent away , they can never come by their own , therefore I hope they will not be averse to what I offer . I have not much more to offer : But as I have the Honour to be known to some Gentlemen on the Bench , I should be glad to have the Favour of the Court , that I may be useful to the People I have injur 'd . My Lord , there is one thing which bore pretty hard upon me at my Trial , and which I mention now , not to extenuate my Guilt , but for the Preservation of those who otherwise may fall into my unhappy Condition : In Relation to the Bibles and Newcastle 's Horsemanship , I solemnly declare , that I did charge the Librarian to put them to my Account . If a Man goes and takes a Book according to the Rules of the College , and orders the Book to be set down , if it should be neglected , no Gentleman can be safe : I mention this that they may take more Care , and that Accidents of this kind may be prevented for the future . I am now going to suffer the Law , and the Sentence to be pronounced . The Act gives a discretionary Power to the Court , and if they think fit , the Offender may be burnt in the Hand : But whether the Court will use that discretionary Power with Mercy to me , I know not . For my own Part , I had now rather go abroad , than stay at home ; but there are some Reasons which make it better for me to stay at home . I have been confined half a Year already , and I do n't know whether I shall have Opportunity to make Application for Mercy , or to make any Discoveries before the Transports go . Then the Sentence of Transportation was pronounced . On Tuesday , May 11 . Mr. Justice mov 'd by his Council , that he might be allow 'd to transport himself , or that a worthy Gentleman of the City of York might contract for him ; but the Court would not grant him such Liberty . 104. Jacob Dell of St. Botolph Aldgate , was indicted that he on the 21 of January , with Force and Arms , 14 Dozen Pounds of the Candles , Parcel of the 20 Dozen , feloniously stolen , did receive , knowing them to be stolen . Elizabeth Grigson . Richard Yates the younger , convicted for stealing the Candles , lived in my House ; I sold the Candles for him , and paid him the Money . Mr. Dell had 14 Dozen of them . I sold them to him for 4 s. a Dozen . Council . Did you never sell any for less than 4 d. a Pound ? Grigson . No . Council . Did you never sell any for a half Penny a Candle ? Grigson . No * ; I sold them for three Farthings a Candle , and to Dell for 4 s. a Dozen . The Man lodged in my House , and owed me Money , and said he would pay me if I sold the Candles , and I thought Dell a proper Person to buy them . I keep a Chandler 's Shop and sold Candles in the Shop . * See Elizabeth Holden 's Evidence on Yates 's Trial ; Sessions Paper , No . 3 . Q . Did you use to sell such Quantities as 14 Dozen at a Time ? Grigson . No . Q . Was Mr. Dell ever your Customer , but for Candles ? Grigson . No , and he had these all at one Price . Pris . What Quantities of them were broke ? Grigson . Near half of them . Q . Did you apply to Dell , or did Dell apply to you ? Grigson . I went to him , and asked him if he wanted any Candles ; he asked what Candles they were I told him there were 17 or 18 to the 3 Pounds ; he asked me whence they came ; I said , they were Perquisites of the King 's Servants . Council . Perquisite Candles ! have all you sold been li't or broken ? Grigson . I can bring some People who have had Candles neither li't nor broke . Q . And do n't you think they are such Perquisites as Peop ' e are try 'd here for . Juryman . What induced you to apply to Mr. Dell ? Grigson . I dealt with him for Butter , Cheese and Bacon . Council . Other Candles you sold for 5 d. a Pound , how came you to sell these for 4 d. when they were thicker and larger ? Grigson . They were indeed thicker and larger , but I believe there was almost one half of them broke , and Dell said he did not think them any great Penny-worth on that account . Prisoner . Did not you tell me they were Dutch Candels ? Q . If she told you they were Dutch Candles , how came you to imagine they were the King 's Candles ? Grigson . I thought they were Perquisite Candles , come from Holland . Henry Willonghby . On the 21st of January , I was sent for and told , that the Excise-Officers had seized a large Quantity of Candles , supposing them not to have paid the Duty : Upon Enquiry I found them to be my Mother in Law 's Candles , They were seized about Two o'Clock , and about Eight I was sent for , and then Dell came to me and said , I have got some of Mrs. Greswell 's Candles that were stole ; this was after the Discovery . I am surpriz 'd , says I , that you should encourage any Thing of this Kind , I have 10 or 11 Dozen , says he , I bought them for Perquisite Candles : They must be broke or lit then , said I . No , he told me , that there was not one broke , nor one that had been lighted . I asked him what could tempt him to buy such Quantities , they were more than could be Perquisite Candles fairly , the King should not be here any more than a private Person ; but now the Thieves are tied , you make the Discovery . However , I would have thought as well of Mr. Dell . as I could , and hoped he would have assisted me in the Prosecution of the Persons concerned , but he told me he would not come . I had put this Woman into the Indictment with the two Yates 's , but I knew I could not convict the Prisoners without him : He came at last , and was in the Court when the Bill was drawn , but went away , and I was forced to have another Bill drawn , and to admit the Woman an Evidence in this , who was a Principal in the other , else I could not have made any thing out . Council Are you sure Dell told you , that none of the Candles were broke , nor lit ? Willoughby . On my Conscience and Oath , he told me they were not ; and that he bought them as Perquisite Candles from St. James 's . After the Trial was over , I asked him what he designed to do with the Candles : he said he would keep them . What , says I , after you have heard the Property prov 'd ? Do you act like an honest Man ? Prisoner . Did not I freely own I bought the Candles , and told you the Price ? Willoughby . He did , and threatned me if I did so and so , if I went on with the Prosecution , what he would do . Prisoner . Did you apprehend this Indictment was Felony ? Willoughby . I did not know what it was . Prisoner . Did not you say you was shock 'd at it ? Willoughby . I said I was sorry , and was , perhaps , more uneasy , than he was himself Prisoner . Did not I bring this Letter to you , which Grigson sent to me , by which means the Thief was taken ? Willoughby . I believe I might see this Letter , but , I believe it was a Day or two afterward . Clerk reads the Letter . To Mr. Dell , These , Signed Eliz Grigson . Sir . ' I am in the Concern in Life to ' hear of the Trouble you are like to have on my ' Account , but depend on my appearing to ' you . I am innocent of their being stole , as ' you are . He told me , they were Perquisites ' of the King 's Servants : I took them as such , ' and , he says , they came from Holland : I ' have heard he is in Farthing Fields . There ' are 4 or 5 near Houses , and he is at the 3d ' and the Persons Name is Malt , and I should ' be glad if Mr Bray and you could take him ' to clear us . Sir , be satisfied , I will appear ' whenever you have necessity for me , or I ' should think myself the worst of Creatures ; ' or if it was that which would hang me , I ' will appear and own I sold them for Perquisite ' Candles , and he brought them to me open , ' and I unhappily brought them to you unknown ' to him : When I see you , I will give ' you a more particular Account , which shall be ' whenever you fix the Time . ' Q What do Candles sell for in the common Way of Trade ? Willoughby I gave my Mother five Shillings a Dozen : I had twelve Dozen , for which I paid 3 l. John Speller . Mr. Dell call 'd me in one Day , before the Thing was found out , and shewed me a Candle ; ( I was Mrs Greswell 's Apprentice ) and he said he had those Candles out of the Country at four Shillings a Dozen . I said I would give him four Shillings and six Pence for an Hundred Dozen . It was a whole Candle ; he bid me break it , and I did , and I am sure they could not be made nor sold under five Shillings to get any Thing by them . Allen Parsons . After the Thing was known , Mr. Dell shewed me about five Papers , a Dozen in a Paper : The Chief Part was whole , and there might be here and there a broken one , but very few , and all with whole Cottons : I believe there might be half a Dozen Pounds broke in the five Papers : He told me , he gave four Shillings a Dozen for them : I believe I made part of them myself , and they stood us in more , who were the Makers . Prisoner . Did I not tell you my self , that I had bought Candles , and ask your Opinion ? A. Parsons . After the Thing was found out , you came to me and said , you believed you had some of our Candles , and that you had them of Grigson . William Cogan . After the Affair was known , I saw about five Dozen of Candles ; and in the whole I believe there might be half a Dozen Pounds broken . I know they could not be sold under 5 s. a Dozen . Prisoner 's Defence . The Charge against me is of a heinous Nature ; no less than Felony ; the Proof therefore ought to be strong , and bear a Proportion to the Charge , especially if it be against a Person of Reputation , as I shall prove my self to be . It may be the Misfortune of the honestest Man to buy Things in thus Manner ; and if he is to answer for a second or third Hand , what Tradesman can be safe ? Thomas Weedward . My Master asked Speller his Opinion of the Candles , he had then no more than one Dozen in the House , which he had by way of trial , I did not hear my Master say from whence they came : They were brought in openly , and when we had Customers in the Shop Our Porter told my Master . Mrs. Greswell had lost Candles , and her Journeyman came over with my Master to look at those . Joseph Delafield . Mr. Dell freely shewed me the Candles , and told me and others what he gave for them ; I can not remember the particular time , but it was before the Discovery that they were stolen , and there were some of them broke ; he said they were Perquisite Candles . John Hattersley , deposed to the same Effect , adding that Grigson was a good Customer to him ; that if she had come to him he should have taken them of her ; that the Commissioners of the Navy at that time gave but 4 s. 2 d. a Dozen , and at that time Candles were sold at different Prices by different People . Richard Norman . I sold good condition 'd Candles at that time for 4 s. 4 d. if these Candles were in the condition they have been sworn , I would not have given 3 s. 6 d. The Victualling Office a little before , gave 3 s. 11 d. I offered them at 3 s. 11 pence half penny per Dozen . - Bracebridge . Mr. Willoughby told me this Prosecution was owing to Dell 's Obstinacy ; if he had not been obstinate he had never gone so far . Justice Richards . I heard Willoughby say he expected Dell shou 'd have return 'd the Candles ; that he was concerned at what was done , and had not had a Wink of Sleep all Night ; but Mr. Dell he said , had not used him well , for he had told him , he had paid for the Candles and would keep them , had he returned them , Mr. Willoughby said he should not have prosecuted him , and if the thing was to do again , he would not do it for the World . Samuel Wright . I have bought Perquisite Candles , some of which had been lit , and some only prepared for lighting , at three , four , or half a Dozen Pounds at a time , at three Shillings and eight Pence , or three Shillings and ten Pence , I can not say , but I should have been cautious of buying them had the Cottons never been cut . Charles Bray . Allen Parsons in my hearing own 'd that his fellow Servant told him , Mr. Dell had shewn him the Candles , and asked him , if his Mistress would sell such Candles , so cheap ; that he told him , there was a great deal of Stuff in them , to put him out of conceit with them , but that they were indeed as good Candles as ever he saw in his Life . Mr. Willoughby I believe might say at the Sessions House Gate that if Mr. Dell would not deliver the Candles he would proceed in another manner . Q . You had no Colour to think the Property of the Candles was alter 'd ; why did not you deliver the Candles ? Prisoner . I told him I would deliver them in a proper manner . John Hattersley , Mr Burroughs , Mr. Delafield , Justice Rickets , Mr . Overall , Mr. White , and Mr. Wright , gave the Prisoner a very good Character ; and informed the Court , that he was a Man of Credit and Reputation ; and one of too much Honour and Conscience to be capable of committing a mean or base Action . Acquitted . After the Trial was over , the Prisoner moved by his Council for a Copy of his Indictment , but the Court would not grant it . 105 , 106.
