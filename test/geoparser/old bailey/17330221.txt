John Crow . I live in Cary-street , Westminster . The Prisoner had been my Servant 8 or 9 Days , and went away on the 14th of June last , in order to go for a Month to see her Friends in Shropshire . My House was robbed in the Night between the 22d and 23d of June , but none of the outward Part of my House being broken , I imagin 'd that the Person who robb 'd me had got in , in the Evening , and lay conceal 'd till I and my Family were a bed , and then committed the Fact , and went out at the Door , for the Door was found a jar in the Morning . I had some Suspicion of the Prisoner , because she was seen in the Neighbourhood the Day before , and was well acquainted with my House . Upon which I went to her Lodging , and heard that she did not lie there that Night as I was robb 'd . On the 28th of September I went after her to Shrewsbury , and - Court . Why did you stay so long before you pursued her ? Crow . Because I expected her up again in a Month , and so thought to have saved that Trouble and Charge ; but hearing she had taken a House at Oswistry in Shropshire , in order to settle there , I went , as I was saying , to Shrewsbury , where I got a Warrant to search her House . When I came thither , I found her at Home , and as soon as she saw me , she open 'd a Chest , and took out a Pair of Stays that I had lost , and gave 'em to me . Jenny , says I , Where 's your Mistress 's Cloak and Hat ? She said she 'd fetch them ; and so she did . And then she took the Tea-Spoons and Tongs out of the Chest , but told me , they were none of mine . I believe they were the same that I lost ; but I ca n't swear to them , because they were not mark 'd . I charg 'd her with stealing these , and other Goods from me ; but she said , those Goods and 20 l. were given her , by the Person who did the Robbery , that she might not discover it , and that she had nothing that belong 'd to me , but what she had return 'd to me ; but next Day ( Sept . 29 . ) when she was carry 'd before the Justice , she said , she had bought the Goods ; and her Father and Brother coming to intercede for her , I shew 'd them a List of what I had lost , and ask 'd them , if they knew any thing of those Goods ? They said , Yes ; and ( while her Father staid ) her Brother went and fetch 'd my Coat , Waistcoat and Breeches , and she said , she bought them too . Elizabeth Crow . The Prisoner went from me June 14 , and came on Wednesday , June 21 , to take her Leave of me , and said , she must lye that Night in the City , near the Inn from whence she was to go with the Carrier , that she might be ready in the Morning , but she was seen in my Neighbourhood all the next Day ; I was robbed that Night , and we went out of Town next Morning . Sarah Corbet . I am the Prisoner 's Half-Sister , and being to go down with her into the Country , she agreed to come and lye with me at my Lodging the Night before she went ; but she did not come till 4 o'Clock in the Morning , and then she hurry 'd me to get up and go to the Inn , tho ' I told her , the Pack-Horses did not go out till Two in the Afternoon ; she had carried her Box before to the Inn . Elizabeth Grimston , I live in White's-Alley , Mrs. Corbet lodg 'd with me , and the Prisoner bid me tell her that she would come to her by Five in the Evening , but she did not come till Four in the Morning , and between 5 and 6 , she and her Sister Corbet , went out and took Coach in Chancery-Lane to go to the Inn . John Warle . I lodg 'd at the Prosecutor 's . On Thursday the 22d of June , my Maid let me in about 11 at Night : I told her , I suppos 'd Mr. Crow and his Wife were gone to Bed , because I saw a Light in their Chamber ; and therefore , I bid her fasten the Door , and I staid in the Entry while she did it . Elizabeth Gilby . Yes , I lock 'd the Door and bolted it . Elizabeth Chester , the Prosecutor 's Servant . I came down first on Friday Morning ( June 23 , ) and found the Street Door standing a-jar . The Prisoner in her Defence , pretended that her Master ( the Prosecutor ) had given her the Goods to lye with her , and that she had miscarried by him . The Jury acquited her of the Burglary , and found her guilty of the Felony only . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 12.

On the 31st of Jan . I lost 43 Pair of Boys Stockings out of my Shop , and on Feb. 5 , I sent my Boy to search for them in Rosemary-Lane . Thomas Bonn .

On Wednesday , the Prisoner came to Richard Bays , who keeps the Chequer-Ale-House , and exposed the Stockings to sale . A Man bought them for two Guineas and gave a Shilling Earnest ; but afterwards thinking them too dear , he relinquish 'd his Bargain and lost his Earnest ; they then lay at the Ale-house four Days , and I at last bought them at 9 s. per Dozen , which was a Guinea and a Half for the Whole . Ray told me the Prisoner was an Attorney at Law . Court . What ! and sold Stockings by the Dozen at an Ale-house ? Richard Ray . I never saw the Prisoner but three Times before . Court . And yet you gave him a Character to Hancock . Ray . My Landlord told me , that the Prisoner 's Uncle was very rich , and dealt in Stockings , and the Prisoner might have them from him . Prisoner . I hope they have not made it appear that I stole the Stockings . Court . Something very like it . The Goods were found in your Possession . Prisoner . I once had the Honour to be called an Attorney of the King's-Bench , I was sworn in , and I am sure I paid for it ; but I have met with Vicissitudes in Life , as any Man may . Court . Are you a wholesale Dealer in Stockings too ? How came you by those Goods ? Prisoner . Why , there 's the Mischief of it . 'T is my Unhappiness that I ca n't prove how I came by them .

I said , about Nine ; and suspecting them to be Rogues I run for it . They followed , and one coming close after me swore by God , he wou 'd make me remember running ; I held up my Stick , upon which another said , Damn him , does he resist ? Kill him . Then the first struck at me with a Stick , I warded off 2 or 3 Blows , but at last I was knock 'd down and stunned , and got a mighty Cut in my Head .

Mr. Justice Hilder . Simmonds surrender 'd himself voluntarily to me ; I ask 'd the Prisoners if they knew him , and they said , Yes . John Berry .

Nathaniel Adams . Harry Fowl had been my Servant 2 or 3 Years . I lost a great many Goods in that Time ; but did not suspect him , for I took him to be very honest . I have laid no more to his Charge in the Indictment , than what I found again at his Lodging in Honey-Lane Market , and at other Places , and what I have here to produce . When these Goods were restored to me , I compared several of the Quantities with the Pieces I had from whence they were cut , and they tallied . This Piece of White Mantua Silk in particular , has his own Mark of 36 half Yards on it , and-this , with the Piece I have at home , from whence it was parted , makes exactly that Measure ; here are 49 Quantities cut off , which make 169 Yards in all , which we have put up in 7 Parcels , seal 'd and mark 'd ; 5 of these Parcels I swear to , but the other 2 , my Partner knows better than I. Richard Manning . I keep the Sign of the Carpenter and Weavers Arms , in Honey-Lane Market , the Weavers use my House to sell their Goods to other Weavers and Macklers , and I have a great many Warehouses on purpose to lay their Goods in ; a Porter having at several Times brought several Parcels for the Prisoner - , to dispose of , I at last open 'd some of them , and found them not to be whole Pieces nor Remnants , but Quantities cut off , which gave me some Suspicion . I shew 'd them to several Weavers , who believ 'd , with me , that they were stolen ; upon which , I order 'd my Boy ( next time the Porter came ) to dog him . The Boy did , and told me , that he follow 'd the Porter to Mr. Biard 's , at the Queen's-Arms , on Ludgate-Hill ; I went to Mr. Biard 's , and and told him , that his Porter had brought 9 Pieces of Silk to my House that Day for - . Mr. Biard came to my House , but did not own any of the Goods ; however , he took one Piece of Cloth-colour 'd Mantua , and went with me to several Mercers Shops , and at last matched it at Mr. Adams 's . The Prisoner Fowl was not then within , but he came while we staid . He was charged with the Fact , and confess 'd that he sent those and a great many other Goods by the Porter to my House for Mr. - . I met with - , and said to him , How came you to take such cut Goods from a Servant ? You could not think he came honestly by them ; I believe I have had as many left for you as came to 1000 l. It 's no such Thing , says he , for I never paid Fowl above 100 l. for what I have had of him . Court . What Business does - follow ? Manning . He 's a Mackler - one that sells Goods for the Weavers ; and sometimes he makes Goods himself . Court . Is it not usual for Macklers to sell for Mercers as well as Weavers ? Manning . No . Court . He own 'd , you say , that he had the Goods from Fowl ; did he say any thing how Fowl came by them ? Manning . He told me that Fowl said he had them at a Sale . Samuel Biard , Porter . Fowl has given me , I believe , 10 Parcels , to carry to Mr. Manning 's for Mr. - . They were ty 'd up handsomely , like whole Pieces , but I never saw them open , and so ca n't swear to them . Mr. Maynard . Mr. Manning charged me with - , and then we went to Fowl 's Lodgings , and there , in his Burean , found these 49 Pieces ; this Parcel was taken out of - Cupboard , which he rents in Mr. Manning 's House . This Parcel we found at Mr. Bullock 's a Piece-Broker , at the Black-Raven behind St. Clement 's , and this other at Mr . Waters 's , at the White-Swan , in the same Street . Bullock and Waters own 'd they had such Goods of - , and said , it was as usual for the Piece-Brokers to buy such Pieces of the Macklers , as of the Weavers . George Fothergill . We found these Goods in Fowl 's Lodging , and - directed us to Bullock 's and Waters 's , where we found these other 2 Parcels , which I swear to be mine . Samuel Edwards . Fowl serv 'd his Time with me , and afterwards set up for himself , but met with Misfortunes . I always thought him honest , and was surpriz 'd when I heard this of him . Several Witnesses appear 'd for - , they gave him , in general , a good Character , and said , it belong 'd to his Business to sell Remnants , as well as whole Pieces . But being ask 'd , if one who they knew to be a Mercer 's Man , had brought them Parcels which were not Remnants , but Quantities cut off of whole Pieces , whether they should not have had some Suspicion that he did not come honestly by them ? They said , Yes . One Evidence depos 'd , that being at - House , she heard Fowl tell him , there was to be a Sale next Week . And , another ( a Velvet Weaver ) that sometimes , in making a large Piece of Velvet , they happen to make a Hole in it , in which Case it was common for them to tear it off , and give it to the Macklers to sell , because the Mercers would oblige them to make too large Abatements for such Faults in their Work . The Jury found the Prisoners Guilty . [ Fowl : Transportation . See summary . ] [ L P : Branding . See summary . ] 27.

On Wednesday Night the 31st of January between 9 and 10 at Night , as I was going from Rochester-Row in Tothill-Fields to Strutton's-Grounds , I met two Men . and pass 'd them ; they turn 'd back and followed me . One of them got before me and the other laid his Hand on my Shoulder , and holding a naked Knife to my Throat , said , he must have my Money ; I said I had none ; then they both began to use me roughly , and I was very much frighted , and told them that I had got 6 d. indeed , and that was all , for I was a poor Woman just come from the Washing-tub , and was going to buy a Loaf ; but they said , they wou 'd have my Money , be it what it wou 'd , or I should die , so he took the Six-pence from me and bid me go back . Court . He ? Who ? Child . The Prisoner ; the Man that held the Knife to me . Court . Are you sure the Prisoner was one of them ? Child . Yes , and this Man , Hornsby , was the other . Court .

Between 3 and 4 on Sunday Morning , as I was beating the Hour in Booth-street , ( facing Princes-street ) in Spittle-Fields , I heard a sort of a clinking , and looking about ( for it was Moon-light ) I saw a Man stooping down , and seemingly very busy about something , but as I made towards him he brushed off ; this must be some Rogue , thought I to myself , and if I should run after him , 't is ten to one if I catch him . So I made as if I had not seen him , and knock 'd the Hour as if I was going my Rounds , and then hid my Lanthorn under my Coat , and stood out of Sight . Presently my Gentleman came back , and out I pops upon him , and now says I , Tho ' you 're the Devil I 'll see who you be . Why so you may , Mr. Hill , says he , ( for be gave me the Title of a Gentleman ) What , is it you , Tom ? says I , if I did not know you I wou 'd carry you before the Officer of the Night . But what made you shun me ? Why , says he , I had a mind to play the Pool with that Woman ; for there was a Man and a Woman standing together in the Street hard by . Now I always take it for a Rule , that wherever there 's a Woman , there 's Mischief . Court . Did you find any Goods upon him ? Hill . Yes , I found 3 Dray-pins with the Chains , in his Apron . Court . Are you sure the Prisoner is the same Man ? Hill . The Prisoner ? No , I know nothing of the Prisoner . Court . Why , of whom have you been telling this long Story ? Hill . Of one Tom Robinson , that I have known from a Boy ; here he stands . Thomas Robinson . On the 14th of Jan . I met the Prisoner , and says he , Tom , if you 'll go with me I can take off some Pins ? So we went to Trueman 's Brew-house , and he ring 'd [ wrung ] off 4 , and we sold them to a Smith in Gravel-Lane for a Penny a Pound , and on the 26th of January we took 3 more . Court . Are you sure it was the 26th ? Robinson . I think so , but I know it was late on Saturday Night , and the Watchman stopt me with them between 2 and 3 on Sunday Morning , and the Prisoner then stood behind me , and there was another Man and Woman in the Street . Hill . I saw none but Robinson and that Man and Woman . Court . What Trade are you , Robinson ? R. A Weaver , but I have work 'd 12 Years with Mr. Coker at the Turnpike . Court . And what Business does the Prisoner follow ? R. He drives Beasts and does labouring Work ; he lives in Nagshead-Alley in Winfred-street , Spittle-Fields . I have been acquainted with him but 3 Weeks . Court . Was it a dark or light Night when you was taken ? R. I do n't remember . Prisoner . He swears I was out with him till 3 in the Morning , which I never was in my Life , for whenever we went out to wring Pins , we always got 'em and sold 'em long before that time . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 34.

Thomas Tims and John Bye , were indicted for assaulting Philip Honeywood , Esq ; on the Highway , putting him in Fear , and taking from him a Silver Watch , with a Steel Chain , a Gold Seal and a Bath-metal Seal , Value 3 l. and 2 Guineas in Money , in the Parish of Belfound , in Middlesex , Jan. 30 . Randal Parry . On the 30th of January , as my Master General Honeywood was riding in his Chariot over Hounslow-Heath , about a quarter of a Mile on the other side of the Powder-Mills , and I and my Fellow Servants were attending him , two Men came riding towards us with their Faces muffled up in the Capes of their Great Coats , one of them turn 'd short on my Fellow Servant Michael , catch 'd hold of his Horse 's Bridle with one Hand , and holding a Pistol ( or a Blunderbuss ) in the other , cry 'd , Damn ye ! dismount ! Michael was then next the Chariot , and I was behind him . I put forward to get up with the Chariot , and endeavoured to draw my Pistol , but could not get it out of the Holster . I cross 'd the Postilion Horses , and came to the Off-side of the Chariot , and took out my Pistol , with the Holster . The other Highway-man rode after me , Damn ye , says he , stop , or I 'll shoot . Do then , says I , shoot . Damn ye , says he , I 'll fire . Fire , says I , as soon as ye will . Court . Look at the Prisoners ; are those the Men ? Parry . I believe they are ; I am pretty positive that Bye was he that rode after me , but am not so certain as to the other , who dismounted Michael , and stood over him . Now as Bye and I were presenting our Pistols at each other , and crying , Shoot , and Fire , my Master , thinking I had pick 'd a Quarrel with somebody , step 'd out of the Chariot to see what was the Matter . Bye withdrew a little , but advancing again , my Master asked him what he wanted . Why , says Bye , I want your Watch and Money ; deliver this Minute , or I 'll fire . My Master did not seem to mind him , but call 'd to my Fellow-Servant , and said , Michael , Why do n't ye take your Horse and come to me ? But Michael answer 'd , They will not let me . Says Bye , I have 12 Slugs in this Piece , and if you do n't deliver this Minute I 'll fire thro ' your Body . Still my Master did not seem to regard him , but call 'd to Michael again ; Michael answer 'd as before , and so did Bye . But when my Master call 'd to Michael the third time , Bye was quite out of Patience , and swore my Master 's Body should suffer for all that Moment , if he did not deliver directly ; upon which my Master called to me , and said , come hither Parry ; I went , and he gave me his Silver Watch and 2 Guineas , to deliver to Bye , who would not take them of me , but gave my Master a deal of illprobus Language , and swore at him , Damn you , Sir , you shall bring them your self , or I 'll shoot you through the Body immediately ; and so then my Master took them from me again , and deliver 'd them to him . Henry Shelar . I drove the Chariot , Bye rode after Parry with a Blunderbuss ; one cry 'd , Shoot ; and t'other cry 'd , Shoot ; and the General thinking Parry had affronted somebody , he call 'd out to him , Sirrah , what 's the Matter ? and so jump 'd out of the Coach ; Bye demanded his Watch and Money . The General gave it Parry , to deliver to Bye , but Bye would not take it of him , and so the General carry 'd it himself . Francis Stanton . I was behind the Coach , and saw Bye come up to my Fellow-Servant Parry ; and Tims stopt Michael Myers . Court . Are you sure it was Tims ? Stanton . Yes , I am sure , for that Man was every way comportionable with Tims , tho ' he had the Cape of his Coat up to his Mouth . Court . Did you ever see him before ? Stanton . No . Court . How far was he from you ? Stanton . As far as to the farther Wall in the Yard there . Court . And can you swear to a Man at such a Distance , when his Face was muffled ? Stanton . I actually think he was the Man : Yes , I can swear it . He made Michael dismount , and stood over him with a long rusty Pistol , and Bye rode by the Chariot as hard as he could , after Parry , and cry 'd , G - d damn ye , stand , or I 'll shoot . Parry turn 'd by the Postilion-Horse , but rode beyond , and then turn 'd round to the Off-side of the Coach . Parry drew his Pistol . The General jump 'd out , and Bye robb 'd him of his Watch and Money . Tims . On what Part of Hounslow-Heath was it ? Stanton . About a quarter of a Mile beyond the Powder-Mills , in the Road that goes to Belfound . Court . What Horses did the Prisoners ride ? Stanton . Bye was on a brown Mare with a bay Nose , and a cut Tail ; and Tims had a bay Gelding with a swish Tail . Tims . Did the Highwaymen follow the Coach , or meet it ? Stanton . They follow 'd it , and then turn 'd back the same way as they came . Mr. Turner . On Monday Evening , the 29th of January , I was at the Angel in Egham , when the two Prisoners came in , I sat by the Fire , and they sat at the Table ; in their Talk , Tims swore , that there was never a better Nag rid than his was , tho ' he had got Corns ; and , By G - d , says Bye , my little Mare is as good as he , and will match him at any time . I have lost 70 l. lately , but I know how to get 100 l. as soon as any Man in England ; and after that , they went to their Horses . About 9 o'Clock , next Morning , I went from Egham , and walk 'd to Hounslow , and about 12 I saw the General 's Chariot , between the Powder-Mills and Hounslow , and about One , or between 1 and 2 , I saw the Prisoners riding through Hounslow as hard as they could drive ; my having heard them talk about their Horses , made me take the more Notice of them . Tims 's was a bay Gelding , with a swish Tail , and Bye on a little Brown Mare , with a Bay or Meally Nose , and she seemed to have a cut Tail , but she run so fast that I can not be sure of it . William Hinge . Hinge is my Name , I do n't know how you spell it , because I ca n't read ; but it 's the same as a Hinge of a Door . On the 30th of January , Tims came to my Shop , in Egham , to be shaved , between 9 and 10 in the Morning , and before I had done , Bye came in , and said , Tom ! what are you doing ? Why , do n't you see I 'm a Shaving ? says Tims ; Damn me , says Bye , I 'll shave some Body by and by . Then the Ostler at the Crown led their Horses by the Door . One was a Bay Gelding with a swish-Tail , and t'other a brown Mare with a cut Tail . Bye . I did not say I 'd shave some Body ; but that I would be shav 'd some where else . Justice De Veil . When Bye was first brought before me , I ask 'd him , where the Bay Gelding was ? He said , he knew nothing of it ; but Tims could tell . When Tims was taken , I ask 'd Tims the same Question , and he said , he had sold the Gelding , on which he rode , the Day the Robbery was committed , to a Shoemaker in Smithfield , about 8 o'Clock the same Night , and that Bye bought the Gelding again . Court . Whatever Tims said , is no Evidence against Bye . The Prisoners Defence . Thomas Wilmot . I am a Publican , and live at Oakingham , in Berkshire , Bye is a Dealer in Brandy and Rum , and I have been a Customer to him . On the 29th of January last , he was at my House , and offer 'd to sell his Horse there ; but not meeting with a Chapman , he rode away . He deals largely in our Country , and I never heard but that he was a fair Dealer . Court . What kind of Horse was it ? Wilmot . A brownish founder 'd Gelding with a swishy Tail . George Brown . The Prisoners lay at my House , the Crown at Egham ; I do n't remember the Day , nor did I see their Horses , but they went away betwixt 8 and 9 next Morning . - Gilbert . On the 30th of January , about 10 in the Morning , the Prisoners came to the White Lion at Egham . They eat and drank , and went away a little after 11 . Court . How far is your House from the Powder Mills ? Gilbert . About four Miles . Thomas Sylvester . On the 30th of January , near 12 at Noon , the Prisoners stopt at my House , the King's-Arms , on the other Side of Stains-Bridge , in Egham Parish ; the People soon after came from Church . 'T is 3 Miles and a half from my House to Belfound , and 4 Miles and a half to the Powder-Mills . Mary Lane . I keep the Swan at Stains-Bridge . At half an hour past 11 , or before 12 , the Prisoners came to dine at my House , and they staid an Hour and a half , or better , for it was near half an Hour after One . Court . Did you look on the Clock ? Lane . No ; but I guess the Time of the Day by the Taunton Coach being at my Door . Court . Did you know the Prisoners ? Lane . Mr. Bye has been 2 or 3 Times at my House before , to offer Brandy and Rum , but I never dealt with him . Court . How far is your House from Gilbert 's and Sylvester 's ? Lane . 'T is a Mile nearer the Powder-Mills than Gilbert 's , and 2 or 3 Doors from Sylvester 's , nearer to Hounslow . My Ostler saw the Prisoners stop at Sylvester 's Door . Tims . Did you see us have any Arms ? Lane . No . Robert Knight , Ostler at the Swan . I saw the Prisoners stop and drink at Sylvester 's Door , at about half an Hour after 11 , and it was near 3 Quarters past 11 , when they came to our House , where they stay 'd about 2 Hours and a half . Court . Your Mistress swears it was not near so long . Knight . I ca n't say how long it was ; but they stay 'd till half an Hour past 1 , for I look 'd on the Clock . Tims . Did you see any Arms that we had ? Knight . There was none to be seen . They pull 'd off their Great Coats , and danced in the Kitchen . Isaac Turner . I live at Mr. Weekly 's , the Red Lion , at Hounslow . The Prisoners came in at 3 Quarters past 2 . They sat down on a Bench in the Publick Gateway , and their Horses stood in the Gateway too . They call 'd for half a Pint of Wine , and ask 'd for my Master , but he was not at home . Then they sent for a Man in the Neighbourhood , but he was not at home neither ; so they stay 'd near a Quarter of an Hour and then went away . They din 'd at our House the Sunday before , as they went into the Country . Our House is a Mile and a half from the Powder-Mills . Mary Dibby . I waited on the Prisoners at Dinner , at Mrs. Lane 's , they came in at half an hour after 11 , and staid till half an hour past one , and while they were there the Taunton Coach came in . I do n't remember what Horses they had . I knew Mr. Bye 9 or 10 Years ago , when he lived at Winchester , and he had a very good Character then . Eusebins Williams . I saw General Honeywood , and a Lady with him , go through Stains , in his Berlin and four , towards his own House , as I was coming from Church , at half an hour past twelve . This was [ after the Robbery , and ] 4 Miles distant from where the Robbery was committed . Then I went to Dinner . I dined in about half an hour , and went to the Swan , and the Taunton Coach was then there . Philip Stone . I saw the General , in a Berlin-Chariot , go thro ' Stains , from London , he had past the Powder-Mills . Then I dined , and went with Mr. Williams to Egham , where I saw the Taunton Coach at the Swan Door . Mary Sherburn . As I and my Cousin Rachel came from Brentford Market , the General 's Coach past us , a little on the other Side the Powder-Mills , and being a little before us , about a Mile or less from Belfound , these two Highwaymen came from London , and never looking behind them they stopt the Coach , and robb 'd it . We were on Horseback , but went a foot-pace , and when we came to Belfound , where we live , the Parish Clock struck 12 . Court . Do you think that Clock went right ? Sherburn . Yes ; it went very right by the Neighbours Clocks . We past by the Coach while the Men were robbing it , and then they rode off towards London . Tims . Are we the two Persons that robb 'd the Coach ? Sherburn . I do n't think these are the Men ; for we had the View of them twice ; the Capes of their Coats were up , and I saw but little of their Faces , and I think those Men were taller than the Prisoners . Rachel Sherburn . The General 's Coach went by us on t'other side the Powder-Mills , we past it twice ; the two Men went by us , and brush 'd my Hamper ; they stop 'd the Coach and robb 'd it . When we came to Belfound I saw it was 12 o'Clock , and my Cousin said she heard it strike , and so said others , but I did not hear it myself . The Men came from London Road and return 'd the same Way ; they were taller than the Prisoners , or anexst the same Size . John Newby , the Tannton Coachman . I was at the Swan at Stains-Bridge with my Coach when Bye and another Man came in ; Bye treated me with a Pint of Wine , and ask 'd it I could not put off some Brandy or Rum for him in the Country ? I said I would if I could . I staid till past One , and then left 'em there . John Garner , Exeter Coachman . I came to the Swan at Eleven ; the Prisoners came in about a Quarter past Eleven ; they drank with the Tannton Coachman , and stay 'd till he was gone , which was at about Half an Hour past One . Solomon Baker . I am an Importer of Brandy , I have known Bye 8 or 9 Years , and have traded with him ; he deals in Brandy and Rum , I have sold him a Hogshead at a time ; He lives in Wildstreet , and has a fair Character ; he has no Occasion to rob , for his Business will maintain him handsomely , and I believe he is no more guilty of the Fact than I am . Robert Walker . I Import Rum and Brandy ; Bye has dealt with me 5 or 6 Years ; I have sold him half a Hogshead at a time ; I believe he was a fair Dealer , and in good Circumstances , for he commonly paid me ready Money . Tho . Foxcroft . I have known him 3 Years ; he lived in Wild-Court in my Neighbourhood ; he bore a fair Character , and there was no Room for a Suspicion of his being concern 'd in Robberies . His Horse was a little indifferent scrubbed Beast . John Andrews . I dealt with him 3 Years for Rum , and I have sold him several Horses , but he would never buy one above 50 Shillings or 3 Pounds , or at most 4 Pounds Price . I believe he 's no more guilty of this Fact than myself , and I have such an Opinion of his Honesty , that I would lend him 100 l. on his bare Word . James Welch . I 've known him 3 Years ; he rents his House of my Father , for which he pays 22 l a Year . Mr. Foxcroft is the Ground Landlord . Bye 's Mare is a poor scrubbed Mare not 13 Hands high , and by no Means fit for a Highwayman . He is the last Man I should take to be guilty of a Robbery . William Watkinson . I live opposite to Bye ; I have known him 3 Years ; I have hired Horses of him , and he has as fair a Character as any Man in the Neighbourhood . Matthew King . Mr. Bye is my Landlord ; I rent a Warehouse of him ; I undertake Funerals , if I had not thought him honest I would not have trusted my Goods in his House ; for I believe he that would go to Hounslow on such an Errand would rob my Warehouse . Joseph Staton . I have liv 'd in the same Street as Bye lives in 5 Years ; I have bought Brandy and Rum , and hired Horses of him ; I never saw him keep a good Horse . William Turner , Distiller . I have taken 300 l. of Bye in 3 Years ; he has a fair Character . James Ford . I sold the Mare to Bye 4 or 5 Months ago , she was 13 Hands and an Inch high , a dark Bay , with a brownish Muzzel , a bob Tail , and a Malander on the Off-Foot , but she would not jump over a Straw , and I believe is not able to carry him . I sold her for 3 Guineas and 2 Gallons of Brandy . I believe the poor Man has been out of his Senses . Here are a great many more Witnesses . Court . There needs no more as to his Character . Shelvokt . I have known Tims 3 or 4 Years ; he lived a Servant at Governor Feak 's in Bedford-Row , and at other creditable Places , and bore a good Character . Tho Bishop . I have known him 7 or 8 Years , and in 3 or 4 Services , and as a Butler has been trusted with Plate to a great Value . He lived in Devonshire-Square 3 or 4 Years ago . Rich . Collins . I have known him 6 Months ; he kept 2 Bay Geldings to let since he has been out of Place . My Horse stands at the same Stables . Edward Bonham . I have known him ever since he came to Town , which is 16 or 17 Years ; the last Gentleman he served was Governor Feak , who is now out of Town ; he has been come from that Gentleman 4 Months , but when he was there I have seen a great Charge of Plate in his Custody . I keep a Grocer 's Shop at the End of Bedford-Row , and have several times left him in my Shop when he was out of Service . John Row . I 've known Tims 9 or 10 Years ; he lived with Mr. Ratcliff in Devonshire-Square , and had a good Character . Charles Creed . When Tims was out of Place he took my Stables to let out Horses . Tims . When Bye was taken he sent for me , and when I came to him I was taken into Custody myself . I see Governor Feak 's Son in Court - if he pleases to speak to my Character - Mr. Feak . I desire to be excus 'd . Court . Call the Prosecutors Servants again . Officer . Here they are , my Lord . Court . Can you be certain as to the Time of Day when the Robbery was committed ? Parry . I guess it to be about 12 , or rather past . Shelar . It was about 12 . Stanton . It was 12 as nigh as I can guess . Court . The Prisoners have called several Witnesses to prove where they were from half an Hour past 10 to half an Hour past One . The Jury acquitted them . 38 , 39. William West and Andrew Curd , of St. Martin 's in the Fields , were indicted for breaking and entring the House of Richard Greener , and stealing 2 Gowns , value 20 s. 2 Petticoats , value 2 s. 6 d. 2 Pair of Sheets , value 15 s. 2 Pieces of Silk , value 10 s. a Gold Ring , a Trunk , 3 Shirts , 2 Shifts , 2 Girdles , 3 Caps , a Silk Mantle , 24 Clouts , 2 Aprons , a Coat , and a pair of Leather Breeches , the Goods of William Walker , December 24 about 12 at Night . Ann Walker . I had a Room in the House of Richard Greener , a Currier in Castle-street near Leicester-fields , and on the 23d of December last I moved from that Room to another in the same House , and got John Smithson to help me ; his Mother lodg 'd in the next Room to mine . My Goods were all safe at 6 o'Clock that Night , and next Morning I miss 'd them . Court . What Goods did you lose ? Walker . A Hair Portmanteau-Trunk , a Bundle of Child-bed Linnen , 2 Gowns , 2 Petticoats , 2 pair of Sheets , 2 Pieces of Silk , 3 Shirts , 2 Shifts , 2 Girdles , 2 Aprons , 3 Caps , a Mantle , a Gold Ring , and some other odd Things . Court . Have you a Husband ? Walker . Yes . Court . What is his Name ? Walker . William Walker . I suspected John Smithson , and upon Enquiry found him in Bridewell . He produced this Ring which I lost out of my Trunk , and was carried before a Justice to be made an Evidence . John Smithson . Mrs. Walker gave me Six-pence to remove her Goods from one Apartment to another in the same House ; when I had done , the Prisoner Curd came by and saw this Coat in the Window between 3 and 4 in the Afternoon . He would sain have taken it away then , but I would not agree to it . Who lies in this Room to Night ? says he ; No-body , says I ; Why then , says he , 'twill be a very good Chance to come at Night and take all these Things away . ( For any thing we can steal we call a Chance - ) No , says I , it 's too near Home , and I shall be suspected , and so he went away ; but after it was dark we met again at a Brandy-shop we use , and then he asked me again about this Chance . At last he persuaded me , and we went together between 9 and 10 to see if we could do it conveniently ; but when we came there he said two Men were not enough to stand upon one another 's Shoulders and get in at the Window , and so we agreed to take in a fresh Hand . We went towards Covent-Garden and met with the other Prisoner West , and brought him back with us from New-street to Cecil-Court and shew 'd him the Place . We thought it was then too early to do Business , and so we went to Curd 's Lodgings and lay down upon the Bed till 12 , and then we got up and went to work . When we came under the Window they said , they believ 'd that I only play 'd the Fool with them , or had a Roguish Design to betray 'em , and therefore I should go in , or they would not be concern 'd with me ; so I consented . West pulled out the Pin of the lower Shutters as far as he could , I set one Foot upon that , and the other upon Curd 's Shoulder , and taking hold by the Hook of the Window above with one Hand , I broke a Pane of Glass with the other , and so open 'd the Casement and got in . I ty 'd my Garter to the Handle of the Trunk and let it down to them ; It was a round hairy Portmanteau-Trunk ; they both took it and went away with it ; while they were gone I got a Sheet and pack 'd up in it what I could find . In less than an Hour they came again and whistled , I put the Bundle out of the Window for them , Curd was afraid to stand under it because his Head was broke , and West going to receive it , it knock 'd him down , but he got up again , put it on his Head , and then went away with it . I ty 'd a Curtain to the Back of a Walnut-tree Chair , and so let my self down , and left the Curtain flying , and follow 'd them ; but in a quarter of an Hour I bethought myself that I had left my Hat behind , and fearing that might make a Discovery , we planted the Goods and went back again ; I got up by the Curtain , found my Hat , and came down the same Way . We preserv 'd the Goods till Wednesday , and then being at a Gin-shop together , a Woman went by the Door crying , Old Cloaths to sell ; we call 'd her in , and ask 'd if she would buy a Sheet ? she said Yes , or any thing else that we had , let it be what it would : Then we shew 'd her the rest of the Goods , and she bought 'em all of us for 50 s. We divided 15 s. a-piece , and paid a Crown that we had run up at a Gift-shop . Prisoner . West , can you tell the same Story over-again ? Smithson . Yes , I can . Court . If you would be understood that the Account he has given is nothing but his own Invention , and in order to detect him , desire he may be put to repeat it , the Court will not deny you ; but consider the Nature of such a Request ; if he gives a different Account it may do you Service , but if he repeats all the Circumstances without Variation , it will strengthen his Evidence . Prisoners . My Lord , we desire he may repeat it . Then Smithson gave the same Account as he had done before . Richard Moore . I never knew that Curd wrong 'd any Body ; his Mother was a Butcher in the Market , and he was 'Prentice to his Brother . Thomas Allen . Curd is my Brother-in-law ; I am a Butcher and took him to be with me , but he has been at Sea since , and in October last he came to me again ; he work 'd for me , and did Jobbs , and went on Errands for some time ; but since that he has been some Way astray , tho ' how he spent his Time I can not tell ; but I believe he has been innocently drawn in . The Jury found them both guilty of the Indictment . Death . They were a second time indicted for stealing 6 Cheeses , value 12 s. and 9 lb . of Lead , value 3 s. the Goods of John Nind , Jan. 26 . John Nind . I went out at 4 in the Afternoon , and returning between 9 and 10 , I heard that 6 Cheeses and a Bladder had been stolen from my Shop Window . George Rathbourn . As I was going to Newport-Market , between 5 and 6 at Night , I saw two Boys at Nind 's Door , I past them , and presently they came along , each with 2 Cheeses on his Head , and went to Curd , who stood at the Corner of the Street ; they put the Cheeses on his Head , and something in his Lap , and went away together . I did not then think they were stolen ; but as I came back , I heard a Disturbance in Mr. Nind 's Shop , and asking what was the Matter ; a Woman , said , they had lost 2 Cheeses ; I told them which way the Boys went ; we follow 'd 'em , and saw Curd and three more , at the Corner of Hays's-Court . Curd went up the Court , and the others went another way , I follow 'd Curd and took him . Edward Taylor . I and the Prisoners took these Cheeses off the Shop-Board in the Dusk of the Evening ; we sold them to William Howard , but he did not know we stole them . The Jury found them Guilty . 40 William Allbriton , was indicted for stealing a Pair of Silk Stockings , Value 3 s 6 d. and a Shirt , Value 10 s. the Goods of Benjamin Devally , Feb. 13 . Guilty 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 41 Edward Day , was indicted for stealing 4 Sacks and 12 Bushels of Barley , from William Bowen , Feb. 1 . Acquitted . 42.

James Hastings , and John Walter , were indicted for stealing 2 Pair of Stockings , and a Sarcenet Lining of a Gown , the Goods of Anne Chaffin , Feb. 1 . Matthew Goodred . I had 2 Pair of Stockings , and a Sarcenet Lining of a Gown to dye for Mrs. Anne Chasins ; I put them in my Shop Window , which has a Sash before it , the Glass was broke , and the Goods were taken away on the 1st of this Month , betwixt 4 and 5 in the Afternoon . James Hamilton . As I was standing in Mrs. Wells 's , ( a Cook 's ) Shop in Leadenhall-street , I heard a Pane of Glass broke , and looking out , I perceived it was the Prosecutor 's Window , which is opposite to Mrs. Wells 's , and I saw the Prisoner go into the Three Kings Entry which is close by . I did not then suspect them to be Rogues , but thought they had broke the Glass by Mischance . But while I was looking , Walter came out , and putting his Hand in at the broken Pane , took out a Piece of Sarcenet , and went again into the Entry : Then the other Prisoner took out something else , I think it was a Pair of Stockings , and went after Walter ; in a little Time they both came out again , Hastings with a Pair of white Stockings in his Hands , and Walter with the Sarcenet in his Apron . Walter came up toward where I stood , and Mrs. Wells took him by the Collar , and pulled him into her Shop ; he said , he had found the Silk . Another pursued Hastings , and took him . As we were carrying them before a Justice , Hastings threw something into a Shop Window ; we look 'd and found a Pair of white Stockings , and the other Pair was found upon Walter , when he was search 'd before the Justice . Ann Wells . As I sat in my Bar , I saw both the Prisoners at Mr. Goodred 's Window . Walter took out a Piece of Silk , and wrap 'd it in his Apron , and as he was coming along towards my Door , I stopp 'd him , and pull 'd him into my Shop ; he pretended he had found the Silk , and offer 'd to leave it with me , if I would let him go . Constable . I found one Pair of Stockings on Walter . Job Hanks . Hastings 's Father was a Pains-taking Man , and so was his Mother too . John Burkitt . His Father was a Shoemaker , and work 'd for me several Years , and I never knew but the Boy was towardly . The Jury found them both Guilty 4 s. 10 d. [ Transportation . See summary . ] 45.

Between 12 and 1 at Night , as I was going along the upper Side of Lincolns-Inn-Fields , by the Duke of Newcastle 's , I met Leonard Butler . Court . How do you know it was he ? Hand . By the Light of a Lamp that was just by ; he seiz 'd my Coat with his Left-Hand , and holding a Pistol to me with his Right , he swore he would have my Watch and Money . I stood with my Back to the House , and he with his Back to the Fields , and being taller than I was , I could the better observe his Face by the Lamp . I said , aloud , Take away your Pistol , and you shall have what I have got . No , he swore he would not , and kept punching me with his Pistol . I took out my Watch and gave it him ; he took it with his Left Hand , and then had his Accomplices ( who I believe to be the Prisoner and this other Person ) to search my Pockets , which they did , and took out 4 Shillings , and 2 Sixpences . Says I , If you 'll leave the Watch for me at any House , I 'll bring the Money for it . They would not agree to that , but Butler bid me make off , or he would send a Ball after me . As I was going , I found my Breeches were cut all down the Side ; I gather 'd them up as well as I could , and went to a Watchman in Holbourn ; I told him my Case , and he came back with me to the middle of Duke-street to look for 'em , but we could not find 'em . Amos Foss , Watchman . The Prosecutor came to me and complained that he had been robb 'd of his Watch and 6 or 7 Shillings , near the Duke of Newcastle 's , by a tall Man and 2 short ones . I saw his Breeches were cut . Thomas Essex . Between 12 and 1 , I and the Prisoners met the Prosecutor near the End of Duke's-Street . Butler seiz 'd him by the Collar , and holding a Pistol to him , swore he would blow his Brains out , if he did not deliver his Watch and Money . He took the Prosecutor 's Watch , and I search 'd his Pockets , and found 4 Shillings and 2 Sixpences , and then I cut his Breeches . Court . What did the other Prisoner do ? Essex . He stood upon the Guard , with a Knife in his Hand . Court . How came you to find out the Prosecutor ? Essex . I surrender 'd my self a voluntary Evidence to Justice Mercer ; then I advertis 'd the Robbery , and the Prosecutor came in next Morning . Court . How long have you been acquainted with the Prisoners ? Essex . Ever since last Bartholomew Fair . Court . Have you any Body to prove that you kept Company together ? Essex . Yes ; we used to drink at the Lamb and Horse-Shoe , in George-Alley , which goes from Shoe-Lane to the Ditch-Side . The City-Marshal often came there , and found us together , and threaten 'd to send us to the Compter , if he catch 'd us there any more . Richard Abbot , Carman . I used to drink at that House , and have several Times seen Essex there , in Company with the Prisoners ; but I know nothing of their Doings . - Taylor . I am Constable of St. Andrew 's Holbourn . The Lamb and Horse-Shoe is a very notorious House , I used to go every Night , with the City-Marshal , to search it , and I believe I have seen Butler there with Essex . - Jarvis . The Prisoner Butler was my Servant 3 Years ago ; he 's a Currier by Trade ; but I know nothing of him for this last Year , only that I heard he work 'd with Mr . Kitchen . - He serv 'd his Time with Mr . Kitchen , and I heard he has work 'd for him within these 3 Months . Court . You should swear nothing but what you know ; what you heard from another is no Evidence . William Harvey . I never heard any Ill of Butler before this Time ; but I know nothing of him for these 6 Months past . Harris was an Apprentice to a Cock-Founder , but did not serve his Time out . And after that , he work 'd 5 Years with a Gunsmith ; but for this half Year , I have known but little of him . The Jury found them both Guilty . Death . 53 , 54.

Lambert , and the Prisoner , stop 'd the Coach , and robb 'd the Prosecutor . The Prisoner took his Sword . I was afterwards apprehended , and by an Advertisement published I found out the Prosecutor . Edward Sutton . I am no Thief-Taker by Profession , but hearing that the Prisoner was in an Information , I went to apprehend him , though he threaten 'd to shoot me through the Head . He did his Endeavour , for he fired at me , and shot me thro ' the Arm , and said he was sorry that he had not kill 'd me . Court . Powers , who knows of your being acquainted with the Prisoner ? Powers . Mr. Ackers ( Dacres ) who keeps an Alehouse over-against the King's-Bench , in the Borough . Dacres . They were both my Lodgers . The Jury found him Guilty . Death . 58.

My House is in Fetter-Lane , the Goods were in a Back-Parlour ; there 's an Entry goes from the Street Door , to that Parlour . I suppose the Street Door was open , but the Parlour Door was lock 'd . About 9 at Night , as we were going to Bed , we saw the Parlour Door was broke open , and presently miss 'd the Goods . Edward Powers being in the Poultry-Compter , sent for me , and told me , that the Prisoner burst off the Staple of the Parlour Door . Edward Powers . On Tuesday Night , the 10th of the last Month but one , the Prisoner and I , and Will . Morris , found the Prosecutor 's Door open , and so we went along the Entry to the Kitchen Door . Court . The Kitchen Door ? Powers . I suppose it was the Kitchen , because it was upon the Ground Floor , and we went a good Way down an Entry ; I am sure it was a Back-Room , but I do n't know what Name they may call it by . So when we came to the Door , says the Prisoner , this Lock will fly , and with that he burst it open . Prisoner . Where did we meet that Night ? Powers . At Mr. Dacres 's House . Dacres . I do n't remember that I saw Norman there . Powers . Mr. Dacres 's Maid knows of our being there . Maid . I do n't remember that I saw them together .

Two Years ago this Person was taken up for ing of Money out of People and he has been out of Jail but 3 Months and yet he has got 18 Robberies in his Information : Is it likely he could be concerned in so many Facts , and have so many Accomplices in so short a Time ?

If your Lordship pleases , we will begin with the Indictment for the Murder of Anne Price ; and if the Jury shall find the Prisoner guilty of that , we shall not give the Court any further Trouble . Court . Proceed in your own Method , Gentlemen . Clerk of the Arraigns . You the Prisoner at the Bar , These Men which you shall hear called , and personally appear , are to pass between our Sovereign Lord the King and you , upon Trial of your Life and Death : If you will challenge them , or any of them , your Time is to challenge them , as they come to the Book to be sworn , and before they be sworn . Then the 12 Jurors ( who tried the other Prisoners on the London Side ) were sworn and counted . Clerk . Sarah Malcolm , otherwise Mallcombe , hold up your Hand . Gentlemen of the Jury , Look upon the Prisoner , and hearken to her Cause . She stands indicted by the Name of Sarah Mallcome , otherwise Mallcome , late of London , Spinster ; for that she not having God before her Eyes , but being moved and seduced by a devilish Instigation , on the 4th Day of February , in the sixth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord the King that now is , in the Inner-Temple in London aforesaid , in and upon Ann Price Spinster , in the Peace of God , and our Sovereign Lord the King then and there being , then and there she the said Sarah Malcolm did make an Assault , and with a Knife made of Iron and Steel , of the Value of three Pence , which she the said Sarah Malcolm , then and there in her right Hand held , feloniously , violently , and of her Malice afore-thought , on the Throat of the said Ann Price did strike and cut ; by which Striking and Cutting the said Sarah Malcolm did give to the said Ann Price one mortal Wound , of the length of two Inches , and depth of one Inch ; of which mortal Wound the said Ann Price instantly died ; and that so she the Sarah Malcom , in manner and form aforesaid , feloniously , violently , and of her Malice afore-thought , the said Ann Price did kill and murder , against the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King , his Crown and Dignity .

If you find her guilty , you are to enquire what Goods and Chattels , Lands or Tenements she had at the time the said Felony or Murder was committed , or at any time since . If you find her not guilty , you are to enquire whether she fled for it : If you find that she did slie for it , you shall enquire of her Goods and Chattels , as if you had found her guilty . If you find her not guilty , and that she did not slie for it , say so , and no more , and hear your Evidence . But if you quit her on the Coroner 's Inquest , you must find how Ann Price came by her Death . Council . My Lord , and you Gentlemen of the Jury , this is an Indictment by which Sarah Malcolm , the Prisoner at the Bar , stands charged with the Murder of Ann Price , by cutting her Throat in the Chamber of Lydia Duncomb , in the Inner-Temple . I shall not endeavour to aggravate a Crime in its own Nature so horrid , but shall only lay before your Lordship and the Jury some Particulars relating to the Fact . Mrs. Lydia Duncomb was a Widow Lady , about 80 Years of Age , she had lived 40 Years , four pair of Stairs high in the Inner Temple ; she had one Maid Elizabeth Harrison , who had lived with her many Years , and was grown old in her Service , for she was about 60 , and very infirm withal : But tho ' she was now past her Labour , the good Lady ( who was Bed-rid herself ) retain 'd her still , in respect to her former faithful Services , and hired others to do her Work : The Prisoner had formerly been employed on such Occasions as a Chairwoman , and by that means had an Opportunity of becoming acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb 's Circumstances . But about three Months ago , Mrs. Duncomb hired Ann Price ( the unhappy Creature , for the Murder of whom the Prisoner stands indicted ) to be a constant Servant ; she was a young Maid not above 17 . Mrs. Duncomb had a middling Fortune left her by her Husband ; and thus she liv 'd with her two Maids contented , and in Peace , till this Night , this fatal Night , the 4th of February ! when ( if my Instructions are right ) the Prisoner entred the Chambers of this little Family , and cruelly deprived them both of their Lives and their Money . This barbarous Fact was undiscovered till Sunday Noon , when Mrs. Love , who used to visit Mrs. Duncomb , came to dine with her . She found the Door shut , and having no Answer when she knock 'd , she concluded that the old Maid was sick , and that the young one was sent out on an Errand : She waited a considerable time for her Return , but to no Purpose . She wonder 'd what could be the Meaning of it , and went down to Mrs. Rhymer ( who was Mrs. Duncomb 's Friend , and lived in the Temple ) and acquainted her with it . Mrs. Rhymer came back with her to the Door , but could get no Entrance . They then began to think some Misfortune had happened ; and meeting with Ann Oliphant , a Laundress ( whose Master 's Chambers were opposite to Mrs. Duncomb 's ) they persuaded her to get out of her Master 's Garret Window , and so into Mrs. Duncomb 's Chambers . She did so , and opened Mrs. Duncomb 's Door . They enter 'd : But the Surprize , the Horrour they were in , is not to be express 'd , when the first Object they fix 'd their Eyes on was the poor unhappy young Maid murder 'd ! inhumanly murder 'd ! and lying weltring in her own Blood , her Hands clench 'd , her Hair loose , and her Throat cut from Ear to Ear ! A terrible Spectacle . But this was not all , the tragical Scene did not close here ; the honest old Servant lay strangled on her Bed , and a little farther , her good old Lady robb 'd of her Life in the same manner . Those who lodge in the Temple must be under a particular Consternation on this account , when by their manner of living they are obliged to trust their Keys , their Chambers , their Properties , and even their Lives to others . About Twelve the same Night Mr. Kerrel coming home , found the Prisoner ( who was his Laundress ) in his Chambers ; he little expected to see her there at such an Hour . He had heard of these Murders , and that she had formerly chair 'd for Mrs. Duncomb , he asked her if any body was taken up for the Murders . She said , No . He told her , it was suspected the Fact must have been done by some Body that was acquainted with the deceas 'd : And as he had heard that she had formerly done Business there , she should continue no longer in his Service , and therefore bid her look up his Things and go . Upon examining he miss 'd some of his Cloaths , and she confess 'd she had pawned them . This made him still more uneasy , and he resolved she should stay no longer : Upon which she went down Stairs . His Suspicion caused him to search further , and in the Close-stool he found some Linen , and a Silver Tankard , with the Handle bloody . Looking under his Bed , he found a Shift and an Apron all bloody . These Discoveries gave him an extraordinary Concern ; he call 'd the Watch , and sent them after her : And such was the Providence of God , that she had not Power to go beyond the Inner-Temple Gate : There she was found sitting between two Watchmen ; she was brought back to him ; he shewed her the Tankard and the Linen bloody as they were , and asked her if they were hers ; she said yes , and that the Tankard was left her by her Mother . The Officers of the Temple carried her to the Constable , by whom she was taken before Alderman Brocas . These are the Facts , and if we can prove these things were found upon her , and that she own 'd them to be hers ; and if we prove that they were not hers , but Mrs. Duncomb 's , I believe the Jury will have no Difficulty to find her guilty . John Kerrel Sworn . John Kerrel . The Prisoner has been my Laundress about a quarter of a Year . She was recommended to me as an honest . Woman by a Gentleman in the Temple . On Sunday the 4th of this Month , as I returned from Commons , I met Mr. Gehagan , and going with him thro ' Tanfield-Court , we found a Mob there , and enquiring what was the Matter , we were told of the Murders that had been committed . Says Mr. Gehagan , This Mrs. Duncomb was your Sarah 's ( the Prisoner 's ) Acquaintance . We went forward to the Coffee-house in Covent-Garden ; there we heard several discoursing about these Murders , and it was the general Opinion that they must have been committed by some Laundress who was acquainted with the Chambers . From thence we went to the Horseshoe and Magpye in Essex-street , where we staid till One in the Morning , and then returned Home . I found my Door open , and the Prisoner in my Room ; So , Sarah , says I , are you here at this Time of Night ? You knew Mrs. Duncomb , have you heard of any Body that is taken up for the Murders ? No , says she , but a Gentleman who had Chambers under her has been absent two or three Days , and he is suspected . Says I , No Body that was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb shall be here , till the Murderer is found out ; and therefore look up my Things and go away . In the mean time Mr. Gehagan went down to call the Watch , but he could not find the Door readily , and so he came up again , and I went down and call 'd two Watchmen , and brought them up , and I found her turning over some Linen in my Drawers , I asked her who it belong 'd to ? She said it was her own . I went into the Closet , and missing my Waistcoats , I asked her what she had done with them ? She called me aside , and said she had pawned them at Mr. Williams 's in Drury-Lane , for two Guineas , and pray 'd me not to be angry . I told her I was not so angry on that account , but I suspected she was concerned in the Murder . The next Thing I took Notice of was a Bundle lying on the Ground ; I asked her what it was , she said it was her Gown . And what 's in it ? says I . Why Linen , says she , that is not proper for Men to see ; and so I did not offer to open it . I searched farther , and miss 'd several Things of my own , and found other Things that did not belong to me , and then I charged the Watch with her , and bad them take her away , and take care of her . When she was gone , I found another Bundle in my Bed-chamber ; upon this , I call 'd to Mr. Gehagan , and shew 'd it him ; whereupon we resolved to make a thorough Search , and so look 'd in the Close-Stool , where we found some more Linen , and a Pint Silver Tankard , with a bloody Handle . We then went to one of the Watchmen again , and he said , he had let her go , upon her promising to come again at 10 o'Clock in the Morning . I bid him find her out by all Means . He hipp 'd to his Brother Watchman at the Gate , and they went and brought her to me . I shew 'd her the bloody Tankard and Linen , and ask 'd her , if they were hers ? She said , Yes ; they were left her by her Mother . I ask 'd , how the Handle of the Tankard came to be bloody ? She said , she had cut her Finger , and as for the Linen , she said , it was not Blood upon it , but a Disorder . Court . What kind of Linen was it , did you open the Bundle ? N. B . The remaining Part of the Trials , for want of room , will be Published on Monday next . THE PROCEEDINGS AT THE Sessions of the Peace , and Oyer and Terminer , FOR THE City of LONDON , AND County of MIDDLESEX ; ON Wednesday the 21st , Thursday the 22d , Friday the 23d , and Saturday the 24th of February 1733 , in the Sixth Year of His MAJESTY 's Reign . Being the Third SESSIONS in the Mayoralty of the Right Honourable JOHN BARBER , Esq ; Lord Mayor of the City of LONDON , in the Year 1733 . NUMBER III . PART II . LONDON : Printed for J. WILFORD , behind the Chapter-House , near St. Paul 's . M , DCC , XXXIII . ( Price Six Pence . ) Mr. Kerrel . I open 'd that which I found in my Bed-Chamber ; but my Confusion was so great , that I do n't know whether it was Shifts or Aprons . She told me the Tankard had been in pawn , and that she had pawn 'd my Waistcoats to redeem it . The Watchman carry 'd her to the Watch-house , and there they found a green Silk Purse with 21 Counters , in her Bosom . Court . Are you positive that she own 'd the Tankard and the Linen to be hers ? Mr. Kerrel . Yes ; but the Linen in her Gown was left unopen 'd till after she was sent to the Watch-house . Prisoner . Was the Linen you found in the Close-stool bloody ? Mr. Kerrel . I am not sure whether it was that , or the Linen I found under my Bed that was bloody , for I was very much surprised , and I brought one Parcel down , and Mr. Gehagan brought another , and we threw them down in the Watchman 's Box , and so they were mix 'd together . Court . Shew the Tankard to the Jury , and unseal the Linen , and let them see that too , and the other Things . Mr. Kerrel . This is the green Silk-Purse , that was found upon her in the Watch-House ; she said , she found it in the Street ; but some Body taking Notice that it was clean , she then said , she had wash 'd it since . This is the Gown , that some of the Linen was wrap 'd in , and this is the bloody Apron that was found under my Bed , and which , she said , was not bloody , but the Marks of a Disorder . Prisoner . Was the Linen wet or dry ? Mr. Kerrel . I ca n't say which , but it was bloody . Prisoner . Did you take it up ? Mr. Kerrel . I took up that under the Bed , and in the Close-Stool . The clean Linen that was in the Drawers , she took out herself , and the Watchman afterwards fetch 'd away that which was in the Gown . Prisoner . Was the Gown bloody , or the Shift bloody in the Sleeves , or the Bosom , or any where but in the lower Part ? Mr. Kerrel . I can not say . Court . Is the Shift here ? Mr. Kerrel . Yes . Court . Produce it then , and let some Body look on it . Ann Oliphant ( looking on it ) I think here 's a little Blood on the upper Part of the Bosom . Prisoner . Upon your Oath is it Blood or a Stain ? Ann Oliphant . I can not be positive ; but it seems like the rest . Prisoner , to Mr. K. Did you suspect me on account of finding me in your Chambers so late on Sunday Night , or was it because you saw me counting Money there on Sunday Morning ? Mr. Kerrel . I saw no Money that you had on Sunday Morning . I suspected nothing of you , till I found you so late in my Chambers . Prisoner . Swear him if he did not see me counting Money in the Morning , or if he did not count it after me ? Mr. Kerrel . No , I did not . Prisoner . Did not you count 90 l. in your own Bed after me ? Mr. Kerrel . No , I say I know nothing of it . If you had had so much Money , you might have fetch 'd my Things out of pawn . Prisoner . What ! Did not you reckon how many Broad-Pieces and Moidores , and how much Silver there was ? Mr. Kerrel . No , if I had , I should have suspected you afterwards ; but I had not then heard of the Murder , for it was not known till 2 in the Afternoon , and after I had heard it , I went to the Coffee-House , and did not return home , till 1 o'Clock on Monday Morning . If I had seen you have so much Money on Sunday Morning , I should have had such a Suspicion of you when I first heard of the Murder , that I should have come home directly . Prisoner . 'T is hard that he will deny , upon his Oath , what he did with his own Hands . Court . What time in the Morning was this ? Prisoner . About 9 o'Clock ; and he ask 'd me , where I had it ? And I told him , from some Relations in the Country . Court . What Time did she come to your Chambers ? Mr. Kerrel . About 9 in the Morning . I sent her for some Tea . Mr. Gehagan breakfasted with me , and she stay 'd till about 1 o'Clock , when the Horn founded for Commons . Council . There was , you say , clean Linen taken out of the Drawers ? Mr. Kerrel . I think this is the same . Council . Was there any Blood upon it ? Mr. Kerrel . No I should have seiz 'd her presently , if I had found any Blood before she went away first . Council . Did she own that clean Linen to be hers too ? Mr. Kerrel . Yes . John Gehagan Sworn . John Gehagan . I have Chambers over the Alienation-Office , 3 Pair of Stairs high . Mine are on the Left-Hand , and Mr. Kerrel 's on the Right , we are very intimate together . On Sunday Morning , the 4th of February , I rose about 8 o ' Clock , and saw Mr. Kerrel 's Door shut . About 9 , the Prisoner came up , and open 'd his Door , and went in , and it was not 10 Minutes before he came to my Bed-Side , and says he , You was a good Advocate for me last Night , and I 'll give you a Breakfast . He gave her a Shilling to fetch some Tea ; she made it , and stay 'd till the Horn blew for Commons . And after Common 's he and I went out together . Going thro ' Tanfield-Court , we found a Mob there , and seeing Mr. Clark , a Writer , we ask 'd , what was the Matter ? He told us of the Murder , and said to Mr. Kerrel , this is your Laundress 's Acquaintance . We went to a Coffee-House , in Covent-Garden , where some Gentlemen talking about the Murder , said , they should suspect some of the Laundress 's . We stay 'd there till 8 , and then went to the Horse-Shoe and Magpye , in Essex-Street , where we stay 'd till 1 in the Morning , and then going home , we found his Door open , a Fire and Candle in the Room , and the Prisoner standing by the Fire-Side . Says Mr. Kerrel , Sarah , this Mrs. Duncomb was one of your Acquaintance , have you heard of any Body 's being taken up for the Murder ? She said , that one Mr. Knight , who had Chambers under Mrs. Duncomb 's , was suspected . Well , says Mr. Kerrel , I 'll have no Body stay in my Room , that was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb . I went down to call the Watch , but there being a double Door to the Alienation-Office , I fumbled , and could not get it open ; so he came down and brought the Watch up . He miss 'd his Waistcoats , and ask 'd her where they were ? She desir 'd him to let her speak a Word with him in private ? He said , No , I have no Business with you that needs be made a Secret of . Then she told him they were pawn 'd . He kick 'd a Bundle that lay in the Closet , and ask 'd her what it was ? She said it was an old Gown of hers , with a Shift and Apron in it ; but it was a very indecent Sight for a Man to see , and therefore desired him not to look into it , and so he put it aside again . Then the Watch took her down , and when she was gone he look 'd under his Bed , and found another Bundle , Zounds ! says he , here 's another Bundle of Linen that this Bitch has left behind her ; and looking farther , he found the Li nen and the bloody Tankard in the Closestool . We went down together , and he called to the Watch , and ask 'd him where the Woman was ? The Watchman said he had let her go . You Dog , says Mr. Kerrel , go and find her again , or I 'll send you to Newgate . The Watchman soon met with her , and brought her to us . You bloody murdering Bitch you ! says I , was it not enough to rob the People , and be damn 'd to you , but you must murder them too ? I 'll see you hang 'd , you Bitch ! you bloody Bitch you ! So I shew 'd her the Tankard , and she began to wipe the Handle with her Apron ; but says I , No , you bloody Bitch , you sha n't wipe it off . She said it was her own , and that her Mother gave it her , and that she had fetch 'd it out of pawn , where it had lain for 30 s. You bloody Bitch you , says I , your Mother was never worth such a Tankard . I had much ado , to keep my Hands off of the Bitch . Court . How came ye to know that the Prisoner was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb ? Mr. Gehagan . She told me so herself . Court . Did you see the Linen that was taken out of the Close-stool ? Mr. Gehagan . Mr. Kerrel gave me that Linen and the Tankard , and I carried them down . I saw this bloody Apron and bloody Smock taken out of the Gown . The Bundle was in the Closet when Mr. Kerrel mist his Waistcoats , but it was not open 'd then ; the Watchman fetch 'd it away afterwards . Prisoner . Was the Blood on the Tankard dry ? Mr. Gehagan . It appear 'd then to be fresh . Prisoner . Was the Blood on the Shift and Apron wet or dry ? Mr. Gehagan . I do n't know certainly . Pris . Who took the Shift up ? Mr. Gehagan . I had it in my Hand ; the Blood on it was like that on the Tankard , which I thought was wet . Pris . It had been folded up ever since , till now , and if it was wet then , it must be damp still if no Air has come to it . - Was the Linen in the Close-stool bloody , and what Linen was it ? Mr. Gehagan . I do n't know what Linen it was , nor whether it was bloody or no . Pris . Was the Linen in the Gown delivered to me before I went to the Watch-house ? Mr. Gehagan . No ; on her saying it was indecent it was left , but the Watchman came afterwards and said the Constable thought it necessary to have the Smock and Apron . Pris . What Gown had I on ? Mr. Gehagan . I do n't know . Pris . I would ask Mr. Kerrel the same Question . Mr. Kerrel . You came up in that blue Riding-hood you have on now , but I did not mind what Gown . Pris . Had I any Blood on my Cloaths , or was I clean drest ? Court . Why it was Monday Morning when you was taken , you had 24 Hours time to shift your Cloaths . Pris . Had I shifted my self with clean Linen . Mr. Kerrel . I do n't know , I did not observe . John Mastreter Sworn . J. Mastreter . I was on my Watch in the Temple that Night the Murder was done ; and nothing past but Gentlemen going to their Chambers . Next Night , or Monday Morning at past 1 o'Clock , Mr. Kerrel called Watch ! I went up to him , and he bid me call another Watch , and so I brought Richard Hughs to him . Then Mr. Kerrel said , Come up , Watchmen ; so we went up and he searched his Drawers , and what Linen was not his own he threw out . Then he went to search for his Cloaths in a Portmanteau-Trunk in the Closet where he mist his Waistcoats , and asked the Prisoner what was become of them ? She said she had pawned them . He said he could freely forgive her for pawning them , but he suspected she was concerned in the Murder , because he had heard her talk of Mrs. Lydia Duncomb ; therefore , says he , Watch take care of her , and do not let her go . So we carried her down , and as nothing was found upon her , I and my Brother Watchman agreed to let her go , upon her promising to be forth-coming at 10 in the Morning . It was a very boisterous Night , and in 5 Minutes after she was gone Mr. Kerrel and Mr. Gehagan came down with a bloody Tankard and bloody Linen . Mr. Kerrel ask 'd me where the Woman was , I said I had let her go . Says he if you do n't bring her again I 'll take care of you . So I call 'd my Brother Watch and he found her sitting between 2 other Watchmen at the Temple-Gate . We carried her back to Mr. Kerrel . He shewed her the Tankard , and ask 'd her whose it was ? She said it was hers , that she had had these 5 Years , and that it was given her by her Mother . He ask 'd her how the Handle came to be bloody ? She said she had a Prick in her Finger , and she shewed it me . It look 'd as if it was done with a rusty Nail . Council . Did it appear to be a fresh Hurt ? John Mastreter . No ; but a Prick she had , that I am certain of . Prisoner . Was the Blood on the Tankard wet or dry ? John Mastreter . I ca n't tell ; but I believe it was dry , because it did not bloody me when I took hold of it . Prisoner . Mr. Gehagan swore it was wet . Mr. Gehagan . She rub 'd it , and I thought it was . John Mastreter . I had not the Tankard in the Chamber , but it was brought down to me . Prisoner . Was you by when the bloody Linen was taken ? John Mastreter . No ; the other Watchman had that . It was clean Linen that was given to me . Council . These Things were found after one o'Clock on Monday Morning which was 24 Hours after the Murders , and therefore I do n't see of what Service it would be to the Prisoner if she could / prove that the Blood was dry ; might it not very well be dry in that Time ? Richard Hughs Sworn . Richard Hughs . As I was upon my Watch in the Temple , at past one a-Clock on Monday Morning , I heard Mr. Kerrel call Watch ! My Brother Watchman , Mastreter , went , and then he called me too ; we went up Stairs , and the Prisoner opened the Door to us . Mr. Kerrel look 'd in his Drawers , and in the middle Drawer there was a Pair of Earrings , which she own 'd , and took them out and put them in her Bosom . In another Room there was some Clothes , and he ask 'd her about his Waistcoats , she went to whisper him , and said , they were pawn 'd ; he was angry with her , and said , Why did not you ask me for Money ? Then he bid me and Mastreter take Care of her ; but as we were not charged with her before a Constable , we thought we had no Occasion to keep her in Custody , and so we discharged her ; she went as far as Tanfield-Court Arch , and then she turn 'd back , and said , it was late , and she liv 'd as far as Shoreditch ; and therefore had rather sit up in the Watch-house all Night than go home ; No , says I , you shall not sit up in the Watch-house , and therefore go about your Business , and be here again at 10 o'Clock . She said she would come at 10 , and so she went away . But soon after she was gone , Mr. Kerrel came down with a Tankard and some clean Linen , and very angry he was that we had let her go . I went after her , I found her at the Temple Gate sitting betwixt 2 Watchmen ; I told her Mr. Kerrel wanted to speak with her , and ( that I might get her along the more easily ) I said , he was not so angry then , as he was before , and so I brought her with me : He shew 'd her the Tankard , and she said it was her Mother 's ; he ask 'd how it came bloody , she said she had prick 'd her Finger . Court . Was it fresh Blood upon the Tankard ? Richard Hugh . It look 'd much as it does now . Then I carried her to the Constable and there left her , and went away and filled my Pipe . But presently I recollected , that when I was in Mr. Kerrel 's Room , I kick 'd a Bundle in a Gown and ask 'd what it was , and she said her Shifts and Apron were in it , and not fit to be seen . I told the Constable of it , and he sent for it ; so I went and ask 'd for the Bundle whereof the Shift and Apron were put . Council . Whereof ? wherein , you mean ; look upon them ; is that the Apron , and that the Shift ? Richard Hughs . I am sure these are the same ; for I unfolded them in the Chamber , they were both bloody as they are now . Prisoner . Was the Blood wet or dry ? Richard Hughs . I am not sure which . Prisoner . 'T is hard if he open 'd them and handled them , and saw they were bloody , and yet ca n't say whether they were wet or dry . Ann Love Sworn . Ann Love . I had been acquainted with Mrs. Duncomb 30 Years . On Sunday the 4th of February I went in order to dine with her ; it was exactly one a Clock when I came to her Chamber Door . I knock 'd and waited a considerable Time , but no body answered ; I went down to see if I could find any body that had seeen any of the Family , or knew whether the Maid was gone out or no . I met with Mrs. Oliphant , and ask 'd her ; she said she had seen none of them . I went up again but could make no-body hear : then I concluded that the old Maid Elizabeth Harrison was dead , and that the young , Maid Ann Price , was gone to her Sister 's to acquaint her with it . I went then to Mrs. Rhymer ( who was Mrs. Duncomb 's Executrix ) she came with me , and I went up again with her , but we could not get the Door open ; I look 'd out and saw the Prisoner at my Lord Bishop of Bangor 's Door ; I called her up , and said , Sarah , prither go and fetch the Smith to open the Door she said she wou 'd go with all speed , and so she went . Council . Why did you call her ? Ann Love . Because I knew she was acquainted with Mrs. Duncomh . The Prisoner return 'd without the Smith . Mrs. Oliphant came to us , O ! says I , Mrs. Oliphant , I believe they are all dead , and the Smith is not come , What shall we do to get in ? She said , she believed she could get out of her Master 's Chamber into the Gutter , and so open Mrs. Duncomb 's Window ; I desired her to do so by all means : She accordingly got out upon the Leads , broke a Pane of Glass in Mrs. Duncomb 's Chamber Window , open 'd the Casement , jumps in and opened the Door , and I and Mrs. Rhymer and the Prisoner went in . Council . And what did you see there ? Ann Love . In the Passage , the poor young Girl Nanny lay murder 'd upon her Bed , and wallowing in her Blood , with her Throat cut from Ear to Ear . In the next Room the old Maid Elizabeth Harrison lay dead , and was thought to be strangled ; and in the next Room to that , Mrs. Lydia Duncomb dead too , and strangled in her Bed ; and her Box where she kept her Money was broke open , and nothing left in it but some Papers . Council . Do you know that Tankard ? Ann Love . No ; if it was hers I suppose she kept it lock 'd up , for I do n't remember that I have seen it in use . Council . Have you seen the Prisoner in Mrs. Duncomb 's Chambers any time before those Murders ? Ann Love . Yes ; I was there about eight a Clock the Night before the Fact , and Mrs. Oliphant and the Prisoner were then in the Room . Council . Do you know on what Account the Prisoner came ? Ann Love . She pretended she came to enquire of the old Maid 's Health . Council . What time did she go away ? Ann Love . She and Mrs. Oliphant went away a little before eight , and I stay 'd about a Quarter of an Hour after . Council . When you went , did any Body lock the Door after you ? Ann Love . I do n't know ; it was a spring Lock , and there was a Bolt within-side , and I believe it was bolted when Mrs. Oliphant got in at the Window , for when she opened the Door , I thought I heard the Bolt pull 'd back . Council . Did the Prisoner ever live with Mrs. Duncomb ? Ann Love . She was her Chair-woman before last Christmas . Council . Did the Prisoner use to lie there ? Ann Love . I am not sure of that . Council . Have you seen her there at any other time than what you have mentioned ? Ann Love . Yes ; about a Month before the Murders she came there , under Pretence of looking for the Key of her Master 's Chambers . Prisoner . If you saw me there when the Murder was discovered , do you know what Clothes I had on ? Ann Love . I did not take notice of your Clothes ; but I desir 'd you to make a Fire , and so you did . Council . Did you see any thing lie upon the Table ? Ann Love . There was a Case Knife with a white Handle , but the Blade was broke short off . I did not see the Blade . Council . What became of that broken Knife ? Ann Love . I do n't know ; it was taken away , but I ca n't tell who took it . Ann Oliphant Sworn . Ann Oliphant . Mrs. Love came to me , and said she had been knocking at Mrs. Duncomb 's Door and could not get in , and that she believed Mrs. Betty ( the old Maid ) was dead , and that Nanny was gone to acquaint her Sister with it , and that the old Lady could not get up . This was about one a Clock , and at two she told me she had sent Sarah ( the Prisoner ) for a Smith to break open the Door , but he was not come , and she knew not how to get in . Says I , My Master Grisly 's Chambers , you know , are opposite to Mrs. Duncomb 's . He went away last Tuesday , and Mr. Twysden has left the Keys with me to let the Chambers . Now I 'll see if I ca n't get out of his Chamber Window into the Gutter , and so into Mrs. Duncomb 's Apartment . She desired me to try , and so I did : I got into the Gutter ; I broke a Pane in Mrs. Duncomb 's Window , opened the Casement , and went in . Here 's her Window , and here 's her Door ; the Door was lock 'd and bolted ; I opened it , and Mrs. Rhymer and Mrs. Love came in : I did not then see the Prisoner ; but I believe she came soon after . In the first Room we found the young Girl , Ann Price , with her Throat cut from Ear to Ear , her Hair loose , and hanging over her Eyes , and her Hands clenched thus - . In the Dining-Room we found Elizabeth Harrison lying upon a Press Bed ; she was strangled , her Throat was scratch 'd : Mrs. Lydia Duncomb lay across her Bed in the next Room , and she was strangled too . Council . Was the Prisoner there then ? Ann Oliphant . Yes , and she talk 'd to me , but I was so concern 'd that I do n't know what she said , and in a few Minutes the Mob came in . Council . Was not you at Mrs. Duncomb 's the Night before the Murder ? Ann Oliphant . Yes , I went to see her about eight a Clock ; she said she was sorry my Master was gone , because it was so lonesome . The Prisoner was then sitting by the Fire by Mrs. Betty , and Mrs. Betty said , My Mistress talks of dying , and would have me die with her . I got up to go away , and the Prisoner said she would go down with me ; and so she did , and we parted in Tanfield Court . Council . You say you open 'd the Casement , and found the Door lock 'd and bolted ; how do you think the Persons who did the Murder could get in and out ? Ann Oliphant . I do n't know . I heard some body say , they must get down the Chimney , 't is a large Kitchen Chimney ; but I could thrust the Lock back , 't is a Spring Lock ; I have often put-to the Bolt my self without Side , to save Mrs. Betty the Trouble of coming to shut the Door after me . Council . Have you shut the Bolt , do you say , when you were without Side ? Ann Oliphant . I mean , the Bolt of the Lock , not the other Bolt . Council . Is there any way for a Person to get out and leave the Door bolted ? Ann Oliphant . I know of none . Council . Ca n't they get out at the Stair-Case Windows ? Ann Oliphant . No , they have lately been barr 'd . Council . Mr. Grisly 's Chambers had been empty , you say , ever since Tuesday , could not they get into his Chambers and so into hers ? Ann Oliphant . I do n't know : There 's a silly Lock to his Door , and I believe it may be easily pick 'd . Frances Rhymer Sworn . Frances Rhymer . I have known Mrs. Duncomb 30 Years ; and within these 3 or 4 Years she has been very infirm , and her Memory much decay 'd , and therefore , she desir 'd me to receive and take care of her Money , and she made me her Executrix . Council . Then you have seen her Box where her Money was kept ? Frances Rhymer . Yes , I have open 'd it 20 Times . Council . Do you know this Tankard ? Frances Rhymer . Yes , very well , it was hers . She used to put her Money in it , and the Tankard and Money were both kept lock 'd up in her Box . Council . Have you seen any Money in the Tankard lately ? Frances Rhymer . Yes ; I kept the Key of this Box , and the Thursday before her Death she ask 'd me if I had got her Key ? I said yes , and she said she wanted a little Money . I ask 'd her how much ? She said about a Guinea . So I open 'd her Box , and took out a Bag ; it was a 100 l. Bag , it lay at top of the other Money in the Tankard . Council . Is this the Bag ? Frances Rhymer . It was such a Bag as this . I carry 'd it to her by the Fire-Side , and gave her a Guinea out of it . Council . And how much do you think was left in the Bag ? Frances Rhymer . There might be , I believe , about 20 Guineas . Council . You say the Bag lay upon other Money ? Frances Rhymer . Yes , besides what was in the Bag there were several Parcels , that she had seal 'd up in Papers for particular Uses . There were six little Parcels seal 'd up with black Wax , I believe , there was two or three Guineas in each . In another Parcel , she told me , there were 20 Guineas to be laid out in her Burying , and in another there were 18 Ludores . Council . Moidores I suppose you mean ? Frances Rhymer . Yes , I believe they call them Moidores . These , she said , were for me , to defray any extraordinary Charges that might happen . Then there was a green Purse , with 30 or 40 Shillings in it for poor People . Council . Look on that green Purse , do you think that 's the same ? Frances Rhymer . I think it was not so long a Purse as this ? Prisoner . Will she take her Oath to every Farthing of Money that was in the Box ? Frances Rhymer . No , I do n't pretend to that . Council . This , you say , was on Thursday , what did you observe in Mrs. Duncomb 's Chambers on the Sunday following ? F. Rhymer . When Mrs. Oliphant let us in , the first Thing I took notice of was the poor young Creature in the Passage with her Throat cut from Ear to Ear ; then in the Dining-Room there lay Mrs. Betty , strangled , and in the other Room I found Mrs. Lydia Duncomb in the same sad Condition , and her strong black Box was broke open , and all the Money and the Tankard were gone . Prisoner . You was there when I was call 'd up , what Cloaths had I on ? Frances Rhymer . I was too much concerned to take Notice of your Cloaths . Prisoner . Was the Door lock 'd or bolted before Mrs. Oliphant open 'd it ? Frances Rhymer . I do n't know . Prisoner . Did you see any way that a Person could possibly get out and leave the Door bolted ? Court . Some Body did get in and out too , that 's plain to a Demonstration . Frances Crowder Sworn . Frances Crowder . I knew Mrs. Duncomb 6 or 7 Years . I know this Tankard , about 5 Years ago she desir 'd me to sell some Plate for her , and then she shew 'd me this Tankard , but says she , I would not sell this , I intend to keep it for a particular Reason , only I would have you ask what it 's worth . Her Plate was mark 'd with a D and a C [ CDL . for her Husband 's Name was Charles . ] She made use of the Tankard to-put her Money in . And afterwards she told me , that she intended the Tankard for her Niece Keely . Council . Look on that clean Linen . These are the Shifts that were found in Mr. Kerrel 's Drawers . Frances Crowder . Mrs. Duncomb 's Shifts had a particular Cut , and I verily believe on my Oath that these were hers . I have one of hers here that is the very same in every respect . They are all darned too in a particular Manner ; there is not one Piece on all her Linen but all is darned . Prisoner . Have they any particular Mark ? Frances Crowder . No , there is no Mark ; but they have all the same Cut and darning . Prisoner . One Shift may be cut like another . Frances Crowder . Mrs. Duncomb has cut Shifts for me exactly in the same Manner ; these Shifts have not been wash 'd , I believe , for many Years , but they were laid up in the Box with her Money and the Tankard . Prisoner . Mrs. Rhymer took no Notice of this Linen . It was strange that she could not see it ; she that open 'd the Box so often must know every Trifle that was in it . Court . She was not ask 'd that Question . Mrs. Rhymer . I have seen Linen at the bottom of the Box , but I did not open it to look at it . Court . Can you swear to that Linen ? Mrs. Rhymer . No . Thomas Bigg , Surgeon , Sworn . Thomas Bigg . Mr. Farlow came to me at the Rainbow Coffee-house at Temple Bar , to go with the Coroner and view the Bodies . In the first Room I found the young Maid , Ann Price , lying in Bed with her Hair loose , and only her Shift on : her Chin was fixt down , as if done with a Design to hide the Cuts in her Throat . I lifted her Chin up and found three Incisions ; one of them was not mortal , but the middle one divided the Windpipe , which was cut three Parts through , and either this or the third Wound was sufficient to cause her Death . Wounds in the Windpipe , indeed , are not always mortal , for they may sometimes be cur 'd ; but in a Case like this , where the great Blood Vessels were cut , the unavoidable Consequence must be Death . She had no Headclothes on , and her Hair was loose , and she seem 'd to have struggled hard for her Life . In leaning over the Bed the Mob press 'd so hard upon me , that I was in Danger of having my Legs broke , so that I could not be so particular in my Observation as I could have been . The next Body I view 'd was that of Elizabeth : She was strangled , and it appear 'd to have been by some narrow String , as an Apron-string , or a Packthread . It was pull 'd so tight that the Skin was divided , and the Mark very deep . There was likewise the Mark of Knuckles on her Windpipe , and the Blood had gush 'd out at her Nose . She had a Gown and Petticoat on and a pair of Stockings . I knew her when I was an Apprentice . She had fore Legs , and for that Reason , I suppose , she might lye in her Stockings . Her Gown too seem 'd to be a sort of a Bed Gown , and I believe , being old and infirm , she lay both in that and her Petticoat too . The last Body was that of Mrs. Duncomb . There was a little Crease about her Neck , which was just enough to give a Suspicion that it was made by a String , being ty 'd round , but the Mark was so small , that had she not been so very antient and weak , that a little Matter , indeed , would have put an End to her Life , one could hardly have thought that to have been the Cause of her Death . Council . Did you see the Strings on the Apron ? Mr. Bigg . Yes , they were bloody at the Ends . Prisoner . Might they have been murder 'd with those Strings and no Blood appear in the Middle ? Mr. Bigg . They might have been strangled without making the Strings bloody at all . But the Strings being bloody only at the Ends , which when the Apron was ty 'd on , would hang before , the Blood might come upon them in the same manner as upon the rest of the Apron , or it might be by folding the Apron up before it was dry . Prisoner . If I had this Apron and did the Murder in it , how is it possible that my Shift should be bloody both behind and before ? Council . My Lord , we shall now shew that it was practicable for the Door to be bolted within Side by a Person who was without . William Farlow Sworn William-Farlow . Betwixt the Door and the Post there is a Vacancy , through which a Man may put his Finger ; I put a Packthread over the Bolt within Side , and then went without and shut the spring Lock , and then drew the Bolt by the Packthread , and it shut very easily . Mr. Peters Sworn . Mr. Peters . There being a Difficulty started how the Door could be left bolted within Side , I took Mr. Farlow the Porter of the Temple with me ; he put a String about the Neck of the Bolt , and then I shut him out , and he pulled the Bolt to by both Ends of the String , and then letting go one End , he pulled the String out . Prisoner . It 's hard that People can swear positively to so many Things , and yet could not perceive what Cloaths I had on . Court . They tell you their Thoughts were taken up with other Things . Prisoner . The Watchman search 'd me , but did they find any Blood about me ? Court . You have been told already , that you had 24 Hours-time to change your Cloaths , and that they did not mind what Cloaths you had on . Council . We have another Witness , Roger Johnson , who is a Prisoner in Newgate . Roger Johnson , Sworn . Roger Johnson . The Prisoner was brought to Newgate on Monday the 5th of February : I had some Knowledge of her , because she us 'd to come thither to see one * Johnson , and Irishman , who was convicted for stealing a Scotchman 's Pack . She saw a Room where the Debtors were , and ask 'd if she might not be in that Room . I told her it would cost her a Guinea , and she did not look like one that could pay so much ; she said , if it was two or three Guineas , she could send for a Friend that would raise the Money . Then she went into the Tap-house among the Felons , and talk 'd very freely with them . I call 'd for a Link and took her up into another Room , where there was none but she and I . Child , says I , there is Reason to suspect that you are guilty of this Murder , and therefore I have Orders to search you ; ( tho ' indeed , I had no such Orders ) and with that I begun to feel about her Hips , and under her Petticoats . She desir 'd me to forbear searching under her Coats , because she was not in a Condition , and with that she shew 'd me her Shift , upon which I desisted . Then I examin 'd down her before , and feeling under her Arms , she started and threw her Head back : I clapt my Hand to her Head , and felt something hard in her Hair , and pulling off her Cap , I found this Bag of Money . I ask 'd her how she came by it , and she said it was some of Mrs. Duncomb 's Money ; but Mr. Johnson , says she , I 'll make you a Present of it , if you will but keep it to yourself , and let no body know any thing of the Matter , for the other Things that are against me are nothing but Circumstances , and I shall come off well enough , and therefore I 'll only desire you to let me have 3 d. or 6 d. a Day till the Sessions is over , and then I shall be at Liberty to shift for myself . I told the Money over , and to the best of my Remembrance , there was twenty Moidores , eighteen Guineas , five Broad-Pieces , I think one was a 25 s. Piece , and the others 23 s. Pieces , a half Broad-Piece , five Crowns , and two or three Shillings ; I seal 'd them up in the Bag , and here they are . * Alexander Johnson was try 'd in July last . Vid . Sessions Paper , Numb . 6. p. 156 . Court . How did she say she came by the Money ? Johnson . She said she took this Money and this Bag from Madam Duncomb , and begg 'd me to keep it secret ; My Dear , says I , I would not secrete the Money for the World . She told me too , that she had hired three Men to swear the Tankard was her Grandmother 's , but could not depend upon them ; that the Name of one was William Denny , another was - Smith , and I have forgot the third . After I had taken the Money away she put a Piece of Mattress into her Hair , that it might appear of the same Bulk as before . Then I lock 'd her up and sent to Mr. Alstone , and told him the Story ; and , says I , Do you stand in a dark Place to be a Witness of what she says , and I 'll go and examine her again . Prisoner . I tied my Handkerchief over my Head to hide the Money , but Buck happening to see my Hair fall down he told Johnson ; upon which Johnson came to me , and said , I find the Cole 's planted in your Hair , let me keep it for you , and let Buck know nothing of it . So I gave Johnson 5 Broad-Pieces , and 22 Guineas , not gratis , but only to keep for me , for I expected it to be return 'd when Sessions was over . As to the Money , I never said I took it from Mrs. Duncomb , but he ask 'd me what they had to rap against me , I told him only a Tankard ; he ask 'd me if that was Mrs. Duncomb 's , and I said Yes . Court . Johnson , were those her Words , This is the Money and Bag that I took ? Johnson . Yes ; and she desired me to make away with the Bag . Mr. Alstone . On the Day she was committed Mr. Johnson sent for me , and said he had found a Bag of Money in her Hair ; he shew 'd me the Money , and would have had me to have taken it , but I refus 'd . I asked him where the Bag was , he said he had left it with her . I told him he should have taken that too , because there might be some Mark upon it . He said he 'd call her , and get it from her , and he desir 'd me to stand out of Sight , and hear what she said . I accordingly stood in a dark Place and she came up and delivered the Bag to him , and desired him to burn it , or to destroy it some Way or other . She said she only wanted Witnesses to swear to the Tankard , and for all the rest she could do well enough . She afterwards told me , Part of the Money that was found on her was Mrs. Duncomb 's , and taken out of her Chamber ; that two Men and a Woman were concerned with her , and that she herself was the Contriver , and laid the Scheme of the Robbery ; that she let them in , and sate upon the Stairs to watch while they committed the Fact , but that she knew nothing of the Murder ; that one Will . Gibbs had been with her from the two Alexanders ( the Men who she said were concerned with her ) and that she had sent them 10 Guineas . Council . My Lord , we have here her Information * upon Oath before Sir Richard Brocas . * The Examination and Confession of Sarah Malcolm , taken on Oath , Feb. 6 . 1732. before Sir Richard Brocas , Knt . Who on her Oath faith , That on Sunday Morning last , about 2 o'Clock , she , this Examinant , was concerned with Thomas and James Alexander , Brothers , and Mary Tracey , who murder 'd Elizabeth Harrison , Lydia Duncomb , and another Person , whose Name she , this Examinant , does not at present know , on or about the Time last mentioned , in the Temple in this City , which was done in the Manner following : That she , this Examinant , had several Conferences with the abovesaid Persons concerning the robbing of Mrs. Duncomb ; and that about 10 o'Clock on Saturday Night last , James Alexander got into Mrs. Duncomb 's Chambers , and concealed himself under a Bed till about 2 o'Clock , when he opened her Chamber-Door , and let the said Mary Tracey and Thomas Alexander into the said Chambers ; and that she , this Examinant , stood on the Stairs as a Watch whilst they committed the said Murders , and at the same Time stole from out of the said Chambers about 300 l. in Money , a Silver Pint Tankard , and 2 Silver Spoon , with divers other Goods to a great Value ; which said Money and Goods were by the abovesaid Persons brought down to her , and then distributed in equal Portions amongst them , between 4 and 5 o'Clock on Sunday Morning last past . Court . If it is upon Oath it can not be read , for Persons are not to swear against themselves ; all Examinations ought to be taken freely and voluntarily , and not upon Oath , and then we can read 'em . Indeed if afterwards the Examinant will accuse others , his Information may be separately taken upon Oath , but then it is not to be brought in Evidence against him . Prisoner . Johnson swears he found 20 Moidores on me , and Mrs. Rhymer swore there was but 18 lost . Court . She was not positive , but said there might be about so many . Council . My Lord , we have gone thro ' our Evidence , I shall only take Notice of a few Particulars , and then submit the Whole to your Lordship and the Jury . Mr. Kerrel and Mr. Gehagan have given an Account , that upon searching Mr. Kerrel 's Room they found some clean Linen which the Prisoner owned to be hers . Mrs. Crowder , upon comparing the Cut and Darning of this Linen , verily believes that it was Mrs. Duncomb 's , and that it was in the Box where the Money was kept . Mrs. Rhymer too had seen some Linen there , but is not so particular . Mr. Kerrel found a Tankard in his Close-stool with the Handle bloody ; the Prisoner own 'd this Tankard to be hers , but endeavours to account for the Blood by saying that she had prick 'd her Finger . Mastreter says , That her Finger indeed appeared to have been hurt , but that the Wound was not fresh . And Mrs. Rhymer and Mrs. Crowder both swear positively that the Tankard was Mrs. Duncomb 's . The bloody Linen , and especially the Apron , are strong Circumstances against her ; and as to Mrs. Duncomb 's Door being left bolted within-side we have shewn by two unexceptionable Witnesses how easily it might be done . Johnson 's finding the Money in her Hair , and her desiring him to conceal it and destroy the Bag , and the rest of her Conversation with him , discovers how well practised she was in Wickedness ; and her confessing that the Money was Mrs. Duncomb 's , and that she took it out of Mrs. Duncomb 's Chambers , is a Circumstance so strong as amounts to a Proof . Prisoner . Yes ; I own 'd Part of the Money to be hers , but not that I took it out of her Chambers ; and it was Johnson that instigated me to burn the Bag . Council . And the Prisoner has frequently called upon the Witnesses to declare whether the bloody Linen was wet or dry ; what Cloaths she had on , and whether they were bloody or not ? I know not what Service it could do her if it was allowed that the Blood was dry , and that there was no Blood on her Cloaths , when it is remembered that it was 24 Hours from the Time the Fact was committed to the Time that the Linen was found , and she was suspected ; a Time sufficient for the Blood to dry , and for her to shift her Cloaths . The Prisoner 's Defence . Prisoner . Modesty might compel a Woman to conceal her own Secrets if Necessity did not oblige her to the contrary ; and 't is Necessity that obliges me to say , that what has been taken for the Blood of the murdered Person is nothing but the free Gift of Nature . This was all that appeared on my Shift , and it was the same on my Apron , for I wore the Apron under me next to my Shift . My Master going out of Town desir 'd me to lye in his Chamber , and that was the Occasion of my soul Linen being found there . The Woman that wash 'd the Sheets I then lay in can testify that the same was upon them , and Mr. Johnson who searched me in Newgate has sworn that he found my Linen in the like Condition . That this was the Case is plain ; for how is it possible that it could be the Blood of the murder 'd Person ? If it is supposed that I kill 'd her with my Cloaths on , my Apron indeed might be bloody , but how should the Blood come upon my Shift ? If I did it in my Shift , how should my Apron be bloody , or the back part of my Shift ? And whether I did it dress 'd or undress 'd , why was not the Neck and Sleeves of my Shift bloody as well as the lower Parts ? I freely own that my Crimes deserve Death ; I own that I was accessary to the Robbery , but I was innocent of the Murder , and I 'll give an Account of the whole Affair . I lived with Mrs. Lydia Duncomb about three Months before she was murder 'd ; the Robbery was contrived by Mary Tracey , who is now in Confinement , and myself , my own vicious Inclinations agreeing with hers . We likewise propos 'd to rob Mr. Oaks in Thames-street ; she came to me at my Master 's , Mr. Kerrel 's Chambers , on the Sunday before the Murder was committed ; he not being then at Home , we talked about robbing Mrs. Duncomb ; I told her I could not pretend to do it by myself , for I should be found out . No , says she , there are the two Alexanders [ Thomas and James ] will help us . Next Day I had 17 Pounds sent me out of the Country , which I left in Mr. Kerrel 's Drawers . I met them all in Cheapside the Friday following , and we agreed on the next Night , and so parted . Next Day being Saturday , I went between 7 and 8 in the Evening to see Mrs. Duncomb 's Maid Elizabeth Harrison , she was very bad ; I stayed a little while with her and went down , and Mary Tracey , and the two Alexanders came to me about 10 o'Clock according to Appointment . She would have gone about the Robbery just then , but I said it was too soon . Between 10 and 11 she said , We can do it now . I told her I would go and see , and so I went Up-stairs and they followed me ; I met the young Maid on the Stairs with a blue Mug , she was going for some Milk to make a Sack-Posset ; she asked me who those were that came after me ; I told her they were People going to Mr. Knight 's below . As soon as she was gone I said to Mary Tracey , Now do you and Tom Alexander go down , I know the Door is left a-jar , because the old Maid is ill , and ca n't get up to let the young Maid in when she comes back . Upon that they went down , and James Alexander , by my Order , went in and hid himself under the Bed ; and as I was going down myself , I met the young Maid coming up again ; she ask 'd me if I had spoke to Mrs. Betty , I told her No ; tho ' I should have told her otherwise , but only that I was afraid she might say something to Mrs. Betty about me , and Mrs. Betty might tell her that I had not been there , and so they might have a Suspicion of me . I past her and went down , and spoke with Tracey and Alexander , and then went to my Master 's Chambers , and stirr 'd up the Fire . I stayed about a Quarter of an Hour , and when I came back I saw Tracey and Thomas Alexander sitting on Mrs. Duncomb 's Stairs , and I sat down with them . At 12 a Clock we heard some People walking , and by-and-by Mr. Knight came in , and went to his Room and shut the Door . It was a very stormy Night ; there was hardly any Body stirring abroad , and the Watchmen kept up close except just when they cried the Hour . At 2 o'Clock another Gentleman came and called the Watch to light his Candle , upon which I went farther Up-stairs , and soon after this I heard Mrs. Duncomb 's Door open ; James Alexander came out and said , Now is the Time . Then Mary Tracey and Thomas Alexander went in , but I stayed upon the Stairs to watch . I had told them where Mrs. Duncomb 's Box stood ; they came out between 4 and 5 , and one of them call 'd to me softly , and said Hip ! How shall I shut the Door ? Says I , 'T is a Spring-lock ; pull it to , and it will be fast ; and so one of them did . They would have shared the Money and Goods upon the Stairs , but I told them we had better go down ; so we went under the Arch by Fig-Tree Court , where there was a Lamp ; I ask 'd them how much they had got , they said they had found 50 Guineas , and some Silver in the Maid 's Purse ; above 100 l. in the Chest of Drawers , besides the Silver Tankard , and the Money in the Box , and several other Things ; so that in all they had got to the Value of about 300 l. in Money and Goods . They told me they had been forced to gag the People ; they gave me the Tankard with what was in it , and some Linen , for my Share , and they had a Silver Spoon and a Ring , and the rest of the Money among themselves . They advised me to be cunning , and plant the Money and Goods under Ground , and not be seen to be flush ; then we appointed to meet at Greenwich , but I did not go . I was taken in the Manner as the Witnesses have sworn , and carried to the Watch-house , from whence I was sent to the Compter , and so to Newgate . I own that I said the Tankard was mine , and that it was left me by my Mother . Several Witnesses have swore what Account I gave of the Tankard being bloody ; I had hurt my Finger , and that was the Occasion of it . I am sure of Death , and therefore have no Occasion to speak any thing but the Truth . When I was in the Compter I happened to see a young Man whom I knew with a Fetter on ; I told him I was sorry to see him there , and I gave him a Farthing and a Shilling , and call 'd for half a Quartern of Rum to make him drink . I afterwards went into my Room , and heard a Voice call me , and perceived something poking behind the Curtain , I was a little surprized , and looking to see what it was , I found a Hole in the Wall , thro ' which the young Man I had given the Shilling to spoke to me , and ask 'd me if I had sent for my Friends ; I told him , No . He said he 'd do what he could for me , and so he went away ; and some time after he call 'd to me again , and said Here 's a Frien . I look 'd thro ' , and saw Will . Gibbs come in ; I think it was Will . Gibbs ; says he , Who is there to swear against you ? I told him my two Masters would be the chief Witnesses . And what can they charge you with ? says he ; I told him the Tankard was the only Thing , for there was nothing else that I thoughts could hurt me . Never fear then , says he , we 'll do well enough ; we will get them that will rap the Tankard was your Grandmother 's , and that you was in Shoreditch that Night the Fact was committed ; and we 'll have two Men that shall shoot your two Masters : But says he , one of the Witnesses is a Woman , and she wo n't swear under 4 Guineas , but the Men will swear for 2 Guineas a-piece ; so he went away , and brought a Woman and 3 Men ; I gave them 10 Guineas , and they promised to wait for me at the Bull-Head in Bread-street ; but when I call 'd for them , as I was going before Sir Richard Brocas , they were not there . Then I found I should be sent to Newgate , and I was full of anxious Thoughts ; but a young Man told me I had better go to the Whit [ Newgate ] than to the Compter . When I came to Newgate I had but 18 d. in Silver , besides the Money in my Hair , and that 18 d. I paid for my Garnish ; I was ordered to a high Place in the Goal . Buck , as I said before , having seen my Hair loose told Johnson of it , and Johnson ask 'd me if I had got any Cole planted there ; he search 'd and found the Bag , and there was in it 36 Moidores , 18 Guineas , 5 Crown Pieces , 2 half Crowns , 2 Broad Pieces of 25 s. four of 23 s. and one half Broad Piece . He told me I must be cunning , and not be seen to be flush of Money ; I desir 'd him to keep it for me till I got clear , and only let me have a little now and then as I wanted it ; then says he , Do you know any body that will swear for you ? No , says I , can you help me to any ? I would not do such a thing for the World , says he , if I thought you guilty ; so he took the Money and we parted , but in a little Time he called me down again , and said , What have you done with the Bag ? I have it , says I , but what wou 'd you advise me to do with it ? Why , says he , you might have thrown it down the Necessary-House or have burnt it , but give it me and I 'll take care . of it ; and so I gave it to him . Mr. Alstone then brought me to the Condemn 'd Hold and examin 'd me ; I denied all , till I found he had heard of the Money , and then I knew my Life was gone ; and therefore , I confess 'd all that I knew ; I gave him the same Account of the Robbery as I have given now . I told him I had heard my Masters were to be shot , and I desired him to send them Word . I described Tracey and the 2 Alexanders , and when they were first taken they denied that they knew Mr. Oaks , whom they and I had agreed to rob . All that I have now declared is Fact , and I have no occasion to murder three innocent Persons by a false Accusation ; for I know I am a condemn 'd Woman , I know I must suffer an ignominious Death which my Crimes deserve , and I shall suffer willingly ; I thank God that he has granted me Time to repent , when I might have been snatch 'd off in the midst of my Crimes , and without having an Opportunity of preparing my self for another World . My Lord , as there was more Money found upon me than belong 'd to Mrs. Duncomb , I hope your Lordship will be so good as to order what was my own to be return 'd me . Court . The Court can not determine whose Property the Money is , till the Jury have brought in their Verdict . The Jury withdrew for about a Quarter of an Hour to consider of their Verdict , and when they return 'd the Prisoner was again brought to the Bar ; and they were call 'd over by the Clerk of the Arraigns , and answer 'd to their Names . Clerk . Gentlemen of the Jury , are you agreed on your Verdict ? Jury Yes . Clerk . Who shall say for you ? Jury . Our Foreman . Clerk . Sarah Malcolm , hold up your Hand . You of the Jury look upon the Prisoner ; how say you ? Is Sarah Malcolm guilty of the Felony and Murder , whereof she stands indicted , or not guilty ? Foreman . Guilty . Clerk . How say you ? Is she guilty on the Coroner 's Inquisition , or not guilty ? Foreman . Guilty . Clerk . What Goods , Chattels , Lands , or Tenements , had she at the Time of the Felony and Murder committed , or at any time since to your Knowledge ? Foreman . None . Clerk . Hearken to your Verdict as the Court has recorded it . You say that Sarah Malcolm is guilty of the Felony and Murder whereof she stands indicted , and that she is likewise guilty on the Coroner 's Inquest ; and you say that she had no Goods or Chattels , Lands or Tenements , at the Time of the said Felony and Murder committed , or at any time since to your Knowledge , and so you say all . [ Death . See summary . ] 67 Richard Tredwell , was indicted for stealing four silver Spoons , Value 30 s. and a silver Salt , Value 20 s. the Goods of Philip Harris , in his House , Feb. 18 . and 68. William Crone , for receiving the same , knowing them to be stolen . Mary Harris . Tredwell was my Servant , on Sunday Evening I sent him of an Errand , he return 'd in pretty good Time , and after Supper I sent him out again , but he came back no more . When it grew late I began to be uneasy , because my Husband was out of Town . I look 'd about , and mist a Salt and four Spoons . On Tuesday Morning following , the Prisoner sent Word to his Sister to come to him at an Alehouse in Chick-Lane , so he was taken and brought to me . He seem 'd very much troubled , and lamented sadly ; Madam , says he , that Night you sent me out , as I went by St. Sepulcher 's Church-wall , I met with a Woman that has been my Ruin : She said , my Lad , will you give me a Quartern of Gin ? I told her I had no Money . No ! says she , you do n't look like one that wanted Money ; where do ye live ? I told her with Mr. Harris in Warwick-lane , Ca n't you rob the House ? says she ; sure you may steal something or other , and let it be what it will , the People of the House where I live will receive it of ye . Then , Madam , this Creature came with me to your Door , and would fain have had me let her in , but I was afraid to do that , and so she waited for me in the Alley . I took an Opportunity of slipping the four Spoons and Salt into my Pocket , and when you sent me out again , I went with this Woman to her Lodgings at William Grone 's in Bishop's-Court in the Little Old-Baily . There I treated her with two Quarterns of Cherry Brandy , and then the Woman of the House ( Crone 's Wife ) said , if I intended to lye there all Night , one of her Girls must lye out of her Bed , and therefore I must give her Half a Crown to get her another Lodging . I gave one of the Spoons to the Woman that pick 'd me up , and when Crone came home next Morning , they wanted their Reckoning , and Crone said he would dispose of the Plate for me , but I must give him a Crown for his Day 's Work : So he and his Wife went out and pawn 'd the Spoons for 35 s. but Crone kept the Salt himself , and he gave me but 9 s. out of the 35 , and let me stay in the House till I had spent 8 , and then they turn 'd me out of Doors . Court . What Tredwell confess 'd may affect himself , but is no Evidence against Crone . Did you hear Crone confess any thing ? Mrs. Harris . Yes ; he said when he came home on Sunday Night his Wife told him , that Madam had got a Spoon of the Gentleman 's , and would not give it him ; upon which , says Crone , I said to Madam , Damn ye , no Gentleman shall be affronted in my House , and my Wife shall have the Spoon . I told Crone , he must needs think the Spoons were stolen . I vow to God , Madam , says he , I thought the Fellow look 'd like an honest Fellow . I own my Wife keeps an ill House , but I ca n't help it , she 'll cut my Throat if I do n't submit to her , for she is worth Money . Mr. Lambkin . Crone and his Wife came together to my House , and pawn 'd the Spoons for 35 s. she told me while I stood by , that they were her t'other Husband 's Spoons . Constable . Crone own 'd to me that he pawn 'd the Spoons at Lambkin 's . Crone . I own that I had the Salt and pawn 'd the Spoons , and Tredwell gave 'em me to pawn to discharge his Reckoning , for he had run up 26 s. that Night and the next Morning . Tredwell . I own I took the Things , but I was enticed to it by the Woman that lodges at Crone 's . I never was guilty of any such Fact before I gave Crone the Spoons and Salt to pawn , and he pretended to me that he pawn 'd 'em all for 35 s. but he afterwards confess 'd that he pawn 'd only the Spoons for so much , and kept the Salt himself . Two or three Witnesses appear 'd to Crone 's Character . They swore he was a very honest Man and kept a Bawdy House , and they never heard any thing amiss of him . The Jury found Tredwell guilty to the Value of 4 s. 10 d. and Crone guilty of the Indictment . [ Transportation . See summary . ] 69.

IT 's well known , that the old Way of curing CLAPPS or GONORRHOEA 's by the tedious and uncertain Use of Purging Medicines and Balsamicks , is , at this time , by the most skillful and disinterested Practitioners , held in the Contempt it deserves ; it serving no other purpose than to prolong the Cure , and increase the Doctor 's Demand ; frequently entailing n obstinate GLEET on the Patient , and too often a Pox . Anatomical Examinations of the Parts first effected , have made it plain , beyond all Contradiction , that this Disease is a local one , that is to say , is confined to the Parts affected only , without entering into , or mixing with the blood : Which Parts are the small Glands called Lacune . These Glands have been accurately described by our eminent Country-Man Mr. WILLIAM COWPER , and since him y the celebrated Dr. MORGAGNI Professor ow at PADUA . In consequence of which is most certain , that the proper Way of treating this Disease , is to apply directly to the arts affected , a Medicine capable of altering the Nature of the poisonous Venom with which they are enflamed and ulcerated , and also to cleanse and heal up the Ulcer ; which Medicine must have nothing of an astringent Quality . Purging Medicines taken by the Mouth , will , if duly examined into , be found to have no other Pretence to the Service they are fancy 'd to do in this Case , than acting directly as detergent Medicines , on the Parts affected , after they have circulated through the whole Mass of Blood . For consider them merely as Purgers , they serve only to weaken the Parts , and bring on obstinate GLEETS . This every-day 's Practice notoriously confirms . Yet has it , till lately , been thought necessary to plague the Patient with them three Weeks together , to make room for nauseating Balsamicks , such as Turpentine , Capivi , & c. which can not be ventur 'd upon before Purging , because they are apt to stop the Running , and send it into the Blood before the Venereal Polson is destroy 'd ; whence a Pox certainly ensues . A due Consideration of all these Things has put several eminent Physicians and Surgeons upon rejecting the old , tedious , and uncertain Method of Cure by Purging , and introducing a new , speedy , and infallible one by INJECTION ; that is to say , by siringing a certain Liquor into the Privities , thereby cleansing the diseased Parts from their Venom , and healing their Ulcerations , without the Fatigue of Purging , or the Nauseousness of Ballamick Medicines : and this in a quarter of the Time , and with a thousand times the Safety of the old Method . The great Numbers which Dr. COCKBURN and others have so cured in LONDON are sufficient Testimonies of it . But if we consider ITALY , and especially the Republick of VENICE , where the Venereal Disease occurs more frequently than in any other Parts of Europe : We shall find that there , since the Discoveries of the afore-mentioned Dr. MORGAGNI , they have totally laid aside all other Methods of Cure , and adhered to THIS of INJECTION alone ; which they have found to succeed in so happy a Manner , as never once to fail : So that a CLAPP is now regarded there as a mere Trifle , which before seldom went off without a Pox . Not to enlarge any further at present upon the Excellency of this Method , it may now be proper to inform the PUBLICK , that a very eminent Italian Physician has transmitted to his Correspondent in LONDON a considerable Quantity of the Liquor known by the Name of the VENETIAN INJECTION , which in a few Days infallibly cures any CLAPP , if used in the following Manner ; The Patient , if a Man , is with a Syringe ( which will be deliver 'd with the Bottle of Liquor if required ) to inject about an Ounce of the Liquor twice a Day into his Yard , and keep it there about a Minute . If the Liquor be a little warmed it will be the better This he will perceive the Heat of Urine to abate , the Running to grow white , and afterwards thick and ropey , and in five or six Days time to be quite gone , the Cure being compleated with the utmost Safety . For Women , they may be supply 'd with a proper Syringe by any Mid wife or Pewterer , and they are to observe the same Method . N. B . This INJECTION will certainly prevent a CLAPP , as it has done Thousands of Times , if it be used as before , twice or thrice within a Day after impure Coition . It requires not the least Consinement , nor any particular Diet , nor a total Abstinence from Wine , or other strong Liquors : Though a moderate Use of such Things suits with it best .
