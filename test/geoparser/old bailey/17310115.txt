Thomas Brown , of St. George Hanover-Square , was indicted for sending threatening Letters , one to John Clements , demanding 15 Guineas , and two others to Burrel Smith , demanding in one a Watch , a Ring , and 10 Guineas , and in the second 20 Guineas ; John Clements not appearing , nor any Proof of that Letter being made , he was acquitted . Burrel Smith depos 'd , That his Boy gave him a Letter , which he told him he found in the Bakehouse ( he being a Baker ) but he not bringing his Boy , this likewise caus 'd a Deficiency in the Evidence , and the Letters which were produc 'd in Court ( and said by the Prosecutor to be full of dreadful Threatenings , profane and blasphemous Expressions , and direful Imprecations , and even treasonable ones ) were not read in Court , because not legally proved . Burrel Smith depos 'd , That one of the Letters directing Money to be left between 9 and 10 o'Clock at Night , at a certain Post , in Turn-Stile-Alley , going out of Drury-Lane into Catharine-Street ; that Money was deposited , and he set Persons to watch to see if any Body came for it . Adam Griffin depos 'd , That a Bag of Cinders was first lest at the Post , but afterwards some Money in a Bag was ty 'd to the Post , and that a Woman and a Boy about twelve Years of Age pass 'd by , he leading her by the Arm , and as he pass 'd by , he clapp 'd his Foot upon the Bag , and drew it a little way from the Post , that a Person was sent to follow them , to see where they went , and saw them turn in , where it afterwards appear 'd the Prisoner liv 'd , but there lost Sight of them ; that about a Quarter of an Hour after that , the Prisoner came within a Yard or two of the Post , and looked about , to see if any Body saw him , and afterwards crept to the Post , and there stood looking about him ( and as he supposes ) espying him , came back again the same way he went ; that thereupon he ask 'd him , what Business he had at that Post ? That thereupon he demanded what Authority he had to ask him ; he told him , he would make him give an Account ; that then the Prisoner said , he had been at Piss ; that then he and others went to the Post with a Lanthern , and there was no wet there , or thereabouts ; that then the Prisoner said , that he had an Inflammation in his Bladder , and could not make Water . These Circumstances were confirm 'd by other Evidences . The Prisoner call 'd some Persons to his Reputation , who gave him a good Character ; and there not being sufficient Proof of the Prisoner 's either writing or sending any of those Letters , the Jury acquitted him . N. B . At the Bottom of one of those Letters , which was sign 'd Devil ; there was an Escutcheon drawn with Figures like Devils , for the Supporters , and a Scroll under the Escutcheon , with this Motto , In Hell is all our Trust . Anne Knowland , of St. Catharines Coleman , was indicted for privately taking from the Person of John Blake , 46 Guineas , a French Pistole , a Silver Watch , value 4l . and a Silver Snuff-Box , value 10 s. the 10th of December last . The Prosecutor depos 'd , That about Nine o'Clock at Night , the Day laid in the Indictment , as he was going along Cornhill , he was met by the Prisoner , who ask 'd him to give her a Glass of Wine ; that she carried him to a Tavern in Bishopsgate-street , and her Maid followed them in , that they had two or three Pints of Wine , and the Drawer was going to and fro , and she and her Maid were busy about his Breeches , and he began to suspect them , and was for going away , but the Prisoner persuaded him to stay , telling him , she liv 'd near him ; that he chang 'd a Guinea to pay the Reckoning , and had the Change in Silver in his Pocket ; that as they were going along from the Tavern , and going Home , he fell down , or she fell 'd him down , he could not well tell which , and dirted his Cloaths , and broke his Sword , and that there the Prisoner took 8 or 9 s. out of his Pocket ; that he was conducted to the Prisoner 's House , and was afterwards turned out of Doors into the Street , and taken up by the Watch , being very much in Liquor , and did believe that they had put something in it to make him so , but he did not miss his Money till he had been some time in the Watch-House . Jonathan Broadhurst depos 'd , That he saw the Prisoner and Prosecutor together , and he was much fuddled , and he followed them down Star-Alley into Mark-Lane , and the Prosecutor fell down , and he heard some Money chink , and saw the Chain of his Watch hanging out of his Breeches , and the lappet of his Shirt was out , that he knock 'd at the Door , and a Candle was brought , and he saw her pick up several Pieces of Money , and ask 'd her , If she was Robbing the Gentleman ? That she reply 'd , No , he was her Husband ; but he took Notice that she minded more the picking up the Money than to take care of her Husband , who was then lying in the Dirt ; that he help 'd the Prosecutor up , and assisted in leading him on one side , but he got his Arm loose , and giving a back stroke , struck him on the Chin , he perceiving that they did not care for his Company , left them to themselves ; and Mr. Goodyer coming up , he suspecting the Prisoner , told him , that he believ 'd the Gentleman was got into ill Hands , and so they agreed to follow them , and see the Event , and saw them go into the Court , and into the Prisoner 's House , that they listened a little while , and heard some grumbling and muttering , but no distinct Words , and went and enquired the Character of the House , and finding it not to be very good , they went to the Watch-House at Aldgate , and gave Notice to the Constable . Susannah Harrison depos 'd , That she brought the Candle , saw the Prisoner pick up seven or eight Shillings , and her self help 'd the Prosecutor up , and she saw his Watch-Chain hang out of his Breeches at that time . Mr. Goodyer confirm 'd the former Evidence . John Ward , the Constable , depos 'd , That about Eleven o'Clock , the two former Evidences came to the Watch-House , and gave him an Account of what they had seen , and desired him to take care of the House ; that he immediately went with some of his Watchmen , and there found the Prosecutor lying , his Legs extended , so that if a Coach had come down Crutched-Fryars , it would have ran over them , his Sword broke under him , his Breeches down , his Back-side on the bare Ground , whether he had fouled himself or not he would not say , but he was in a dismal Condition ; that he got him carried to the Watch-House , but he was so dead Drunk , that there was no putting up his Breeches , nor could he stand or speak for two or three Hours ; that he order 'd 4 Watchmen to guard the House , and not to suffer any Body to go either out or in ; that when the Prosecutor came to himself , he said , he was robb 'd and undone . That the next Morning one of the Watchmen came , and told him , the Window was open , so he went and secur 'd the Prisoner , and her Maid , the Maid being about making a Fire , and the Prisoner above Stairs dressing herself ; that he telling her that she was his Prisoner , and must go before the Justice , she said she would not go without a Coach ; he then ask 'd her , If she had any Money to pay for it ? she said , Yes , she had two Guineas , and that was all the Money she had in the World , and pulled out a Pistole , and gave him , saying , there is a Guinea , do you pay for the Coach , and give me the Change ; that he looking upon it , said , Madam , this is not a Guinea , it is a Pistole , that the Prosecutor said presently , I had but one Pistole in my Money , and looking upon it , said , this is my Pistole , it is mark 'd , and I know it by that to be mine . That she deny 'd the having the Prosecutor 's Money still , he thereupon got a Coach , lock 'd up the Door , and carried her and her Maid to go before the Lord Mayor ; but going to the Swan Tavern to wait while they could know that the Lord Mayor was at leisure , there she desired to have some Talk with the Prosecutor , and after that , said , well , if you say so , my Maid shall go with you , and you shall have all your Things ; that thereupon he took Coach , went back with the Maid and some other Persons to the House , and she taking up a Case-Knife , went up Stairs , ript the Feather-Bed about a Foot in length , and feeling among the Feathers , pulled out a Clout , in which was 45 Guineas , and then going down into the Cellar , took the Watch and Snuff-Box from out of some Rubbish ; after which going back to the Tavern , the Captain upon telling the Money , said , there was 46 Guineas in his Purse , and now there wanted a Guinea , upon which the Prisoner put her Hand in her Pocket , and gave him a Guinea . Most of these Circumstances were confirmed by other Evidences . Mary Man depos 'd , That she dwelling in Crutched-Fryars , over-against the Prisoner 's House , Mr. Broadhurst and Goodyer knock 'd and enquired the Character of the Prisoner 's House , that she told them it had but an indifferent Character , though she had liv 'd there but about three Weeks ; that they desired her to observe if any Body went in or out , and she look 'd through a Chink , and saw a tall Woman , which she believes to be the Prisoner , and a short Woman , which she takes to be her Maid , lug the Prosecutor out of the Court , and lay him directly over-against their Door , and the tall one took the Gentleman 's Head and gave it a knock against the Door , and he cry 'd , Damn her for a Bitch ; being ask 'd , what Colour her Gown was ? she said , She took it to be Red and White . Mr. Broadhurst said , when she pick 'd up the Gentleman , she had a Blue Gown , and a Scarlet Cloak , and Silver trimming , and Bobs in her Ears , but he believed she might change her Cloaths before she came out with the Prosecutor . Susan Harrison depos 'd , That she took her Gown to be Green ; and the Fact being plainly proved so as not to admit of any material Defence , the Jury found her Guilty of Felony only , but not of privately taking from the Person . [ Transportation . See summary . ] William Maynee , of St. Mildred 's Poultry , was indicted for unlawfully , wilfully , and feloniously erasing an Indorsement for the Sum of 15 l. upon a Bank Note for the Payment of 50 l. to Mr. Henry South , or Bearer , on Demand ; and for erasing an Indorsement for 30 l. upon another Bank Note for the Payment of 50 l. to Mr. Henry Cole , or Bearer , on Demand , contrary to the Form of the Statute , & c . To which Indictments the Prisoner pleaded Guilty . Death . Rebecca Lynn , alias Eaton , of St. Giles 's in the Fields , was indicted for feloniously stealing 15 s. the Money of a Person unknown , the 30th of December last . A Drawer of a Tavern depos 'd , That 2 Men and 2 Women were drinking together , at the Horse-Shoe Tavern in Drury-Lane ; that they drank till Morning , and having call 'd for the Reckoning , they laid the Money on the Table , and the Prisoner caught it up , and the Gentlemen said , they would not pay the Reckoning twice , that they had given her a Crown , and charg 'd her with having taken a Guinea , but would not concern themselves to prosecute her for it . The Prisoner pleaded , That the Gentlemen were to give her and her Partner 15 s. and they insisted upon having a Guinea , saying , they deserv 'd it for having kept them Company all Night ; after a full hearing of the Matter , she was acquitted . She was indicted a second time by the Name of Lucy Eaton , for feloniously stealing a Gold Ring with a Garnet and 2 Sparks , from the Person of , the 14th of December last . The Prisoner pleaded , That the Prosecutor gave her the Ring as a Pledge till he came again , and brought her some Money as a Gratification for her Conversation , and her having joined Six Pence with him for a Duck they had for their Supper . The Prosecutor did not deny but that he might have put it into her Hands , and could not tell how he lost it ; whereupon the Jury acquitted her .

As also the Sixth Edition of the SUPPLEMENT to it , both of them Revised and Enlarged , and now printed together in one Volume . And as the several Passages in the former Impressions , that have been charged with being obscure and ambiguous , are in these cleared up and explained , there will be no more Alterations or Additions made to them . These Editions contain some further and surprizing Instances of the Mischief , by that filthy , sinful Commerce with ones self , which so notoriously practised , as well by the Adult as Youth , Women as Men , Married as Single , to the weak'ning their Generative Faculties , and hindring Procreation , as their Letters of Complaints to the Author , herein inserted , shew . And , amongst others , a curious Letter from a Lady , with his Answer to it , concerning the Use and Abuse of the Marriage-Bed ; together with divers Casuistical and other Letters from both Sexes , of some secret unnatural Effeminacies , necessary to be known both by the married and single of each Sex .

A very grave and learned Divine and Physician having perused this Discourse , before it went to the Press , returned it with his Opinion of it in these Words : ' This little Book ought to be read by all ' Sorts of People , of both Sexes , of what ' Age , Degree , Profession , or Condition soever , ' guilty or not guilty of the Sin declaimed ' against in it .

NELSON 's most sure , and long experienc 'd Anti-Venereal COMPOUND , or Never-failing Electuary , the like of which is not to be met with , FOR the true Cure of fresh CLAPS , ( and all the lurking Relicks or Remains of old Ones , ) how virulent or obstinate soever they may be ; for it immediately puts a stop to their Progress , and entirely , and as it were , instantly ferrets out and carries off all the filthy poisonous Infection , wears away the various Symptoms , and by Degrees , cleanses off the Running , and heals and strenghthens the Parts sensibly and firmly , without the too common consequences of leaving either Foulness , Gleeting , or Weakness behind . This it does in a way so regular and gentle , both by Stool and Urine , and with a Does each Time , so small and pleasant ( the Quantity but of a Nutmeg ) that the nicest Persons are as well surprized as delighted with it , and the more , as it agrees with every ones Constitution , hinders no Business , nor gives the least Suspicion to the nearest Relation . In a very small space of Time ( living temperately ) it rids away a mild CLAP ; and those more severe according to their several Degrees of Malignity .
