At their Return , as passing by his House , that his Friend being to go to the other End of the Town , and at his Return , which was about Two a-Clock in the Morning , at the End of Cornhill , entring Leaden-Hall-Street , he met a Woman , and ask 'd her to drink a Glass of Wine , and he pressing , and she seeming to yield , did turn down towards Bishopsgate-Street ; that they being talking together for the Space of two Minutes , there was an Outcry of Stop Thief , and a Man came running by and drop 'd some Things , which were the Things mentioned as found upon him ; that he stoop 'd and took them up , and immediately ran in Pursuit of the Persons , upon which he was apprehended by the Prosecutor . To prove this , he called John Knight , who said he was a Brewer 's Clerk , and had known the Prisoner for six Years , had sometimes deposited 40 or 50 l. in his Hand , and always had it honestly return 'd ; and that he had been at the Prisoner 's the Night laid in the Indictment , as the Prisoner had pleaded ; that afterwards the Prisoner would see him Part of his Way , and being in Discourse , would still go a little further , 'till at last they came as far as St. Ann 's Church , and then they parted , being then about One a-Clock in the Morning .

Being ask 'd how she could know him in the Dark at that Time , and by what Light , She own 'd there was no Light but that of the Sky ; but she did know him , for that they stood Face to Face . The Prisoner called some Persons who had been sent to the Prosecutor , to hear what he said , and would have made some Improvement of some Expressions said to be dropt , but to no Purpose .

The taking up the Child was confirm 'd by John Lee , the Grave-Digger . Other Evidences depos 'd that the Prisoner had made some Provision of Linen for the Child , and the Things were produc 'd in Court , and depos 'd on Oath , that they fetch 'd them by her Direction .
