That they were upon their Duty in aiding proper Officers at Vandernan 's House , but wanting more help , and their Lives being in danger , they were oblig 'd to send for military Force , by which additional strength , most of them entered the House ; but that he ( this Prisoner ) and some of the Soldiers did not go in at all , but staid without . In a little time , Burden and Ringrose assuming themselves to be Colonels , came and drew off the Soldiers from the Door . The Mob then cry 'd out , The Colonel 's come , and the Soldiers are going , now let us murder the Dogs ! This Prisoner then went away , and did not hear the Gun fir 'd . George Cartwright produc 'd a Warrant , for searching Gaming and other disorderly Houses , sign 'd by Ten Justices of the Peace , and depos 'd that he , several other Constables , and the prisoners , being at the George in Wych-street , the said Warrant was openly read , when he commanded those that were present , to Aid and Assist him in the Execution of the same . Accordingly they went to several lewd Houses , from whence they took divers into Custody , and at last came to Vandernan 's . As they were coming down the Play-house Passage , they saw Vandernan 's door open , and somebody came out ; they stept up before the Door was shut , and thrusting their Staves betwixt the Door and the Jamb , got in before it could be shut , they then came to the Hatch which was open too , but they were forc 'd back by the Gamesters , who having put out the Lights , came with their drawn Swords and pass 'd at him over the Hatch , but the Hatch being pretty high with Spikes at top , he couch 'd down so close under it , that they could not reach him , but he felt the Swords upon his back . At last he crawl 'd away on his Hands and Knees , and getting up , engag 'd them with his long Staff , which they within quickly caught hold of , but he having the longest end , and poising down hard upon the Hatch to wrench it from them , and they likewise bearing down hard at the other end , broke the Staff between them , he then got off , and they consulted what to do , and at last agreed to send to Somerset- house for the Guards . Those within then broke open the Windows , from whence they threw Brickbats , drinking Pots , and a Chamber Pot full of Piss , with several other things . He ( this Evidence ) then fasten 'd the Window shutter ( which hung by hinges at top ) and they within force 'd it open again . Proclamation was made . The Guards came , and one of them said , I my self will get in at the Window which he did , and then went round and open 'd the Door . This Evidence and several others then went in and Search 'd the House , and found several Gamesters who had hid themselves in it , Some under the Beds , some in Closets and other Holes . While they were employ 'd above stairs , he heard some call from below . Cartwright , Cartwright , come down , come down , or we shall all be Murder 'd . They then came down into the Gaming Room and brought the Gamesters all with them , and those below told him that Burden and Ringrose had rescu 'd a prisoner . Coming in the Entry , he heard those without cry Now we have the informing Dogs ! Murder them , Murder them ! Ringrose seeing this Evidence through the Wicket , push 'd at him with his Sword , and said ye Dog ! I 'll Murder you to chuse . That one of the Soldiers flasht through the Wicket , and they without cry 'd D - ye Dogs , do ye think we are to be bugbear 'd with a little Powder ? That if afterwards the Soldier had not fir 'd , their own lives had been in danger ; that he was with Vaughan , all the time that Vaughan was there , but yet did not hear him once bid the Solider fire , and that he did not see Cholmley in the House at all . Most of this Evidence was confirme 'd by Thomas Burt another Constable . Jeffery Nash said , that having a Warrant from Sir William Thompson Recorder , to search for Richard Mytton , Charles Walmsley , and - White , who were charged upon Oath , for cheating a Gentleman of above 600 Pounds , he came with it to the George in Wyche-street , and there in conjuction with Mr. Cartwright , commanded the prisoners and others present , to Aid and Assist him . This Evidence further confirm 'd what Cartwright and Burt had already depos 'd . Another Constable John Bouch depos 'd , he saw the Proclamation in Cartwright 's hand , and heard him read it , heard the Gamesters cry out D - the Rogues , now 's the time , let 's kill them . Richard Williams depos 'd to the same effect as Mr. Cartwright , and added that finding the Mob would be too hard for the Constable , they sent to the Beadle and Watch , who refusing to come , he went to a Justice of Peace , who went along with him to Somerset House , to fetch the Soldiers . Michael William depos 'd he heard Vaughan desire the Soldiers to draw their Charges ; which two of them did , but one answer 'd he would not stand there to be Kill 'd , and then went out and fir 'd . Mr. Davison depos 'd , that he was near Vaughan when the Piece was fir 'd , and heard him say 3 times successfully , Gentleman take care of your Pieces and do no harm . William Groom , Mr. Philpot and others corroborated the former depositions , and that Vaughan had not ( that night ) a Grey Coat with brass Buttons , but a brown Drab with Buttons of the same colour , and that none of them in all their lives ever heard either of the prisoners Swear or Curse . Randyll , the Boxkeeper at Vandernan 's , depos 'd that the Doors were open to let out one Butler , a reputed Highway-man , when the Constables came . Other Witnesses were at hand to confirm the Testimony of those already examin 'd , but , much time having been spent , the prisoners wav 'd them . Several Justices of the Peace then on the Bench , gave the prisoners a very good Character ; that they were Men so far from making themselves Informers for the sake of Interest , that they never knew them to take even the Reward that the Law allows in such cases , or so much as a Glass of Wine for their Pains . The Jury Acquitted them . Joseph Woolham , of White Chappel , was indicted for wilful and corrupt Perjury , in making a false Afidavit before the Lord Chief Justice Pratt ; which being prov 'd by Five Witnesses , and none giving Evidance to contradict them , the Jury found him guilty .
