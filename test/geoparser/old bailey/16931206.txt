See summary . ] Now follows the Trial of John Dyer , the famous Newsmonger , ( so publickly known both in City and Countrey ) , who was Tried for Composing , Writing , and Publishing False and Scandalous News , to the Encouragement of Their Majesties Enemies , and to draw the hearts of Their Majesties Loyal Subjects from their Duty and Obedience , & c. ON Friday morning , the third day of the Sessions , Mr. Dyer , having been Bail 'd to appear , came into Court , and the Jury being sworn to Try the Issue , the Proceeding were as followeth , There were Two Indictments read against him , which set forth , That be being a Person evil affected to the present Government , and of an evil disposition , maliciously minding and intending Sedition to raise and stir up among Their Majesties Subjects , on the 30th . day of May last past , he did Compose , Write , and Publish four most false and scandalous Libels , in which were these Words ; In the first Letter , The Shallops or Well-Boats which have with so great diligence been fitted out , are now ordered to be laid up again at Portsmouth , and the Stores to be taken ashore . In the Second Letter , The States of Amsterdam have made their Complaint in the Assembly of the States of Holland , of the condition of the Fleet of the States , and do demand , That the Fleet of the States may no more act in conjunction with that of Holland . 'T is also said , they prest Peace , and endeavoured to incline the other Towns to do the same ; which 't is believed they will never consent to till France is reduced to a lower Estate . In the Third Letter , Some French Privateers a few days since landed some men at Altam in Essex , and burnt some Houses , and took some Farmers Daughters on Board , who they soon put on shore again . In the Fourth Letter , The States of Amsterdam are still of the sentiment to have a Fleet of 70 Men of War at Sea next Summer , and to act apart . Then , after Mr. Dyer was taken up a second time for writing those scandalous Reports , he writ another Letter , ( for which he was not now Indicted ) in which were these Words , That the Author of this Letter having received fresh Trouble , and that he was reflected upon by scandalous Scriblers , notwithstanding all of it was true , & c. The Counsel for Their Majesties opened the Indictments ; and to prove all this several Witnesses for the King were called , some of which were Coffee-men to whom he sent the Letters ; and one was a person that was his Clerk , and writ some of the Letters himself ; who all swore positively , That Mr. Dyer was the Author of them , and that they were by his immediate Order sent abroad and published . To contradict this Charge against Mr Dyer , his Counsel called several Witnesses , which were of two sorts ; the first was to prove that the Shallops or Well-boats were so laid up at Portsmouth , which they could not do : The second was to his Reputation , who gave account , That Mr. Dyer was a man very well affected to the Government , for ought , as ever they found by him ; and that they never heard him speak , nor never knew him write any thing against it ; and that he very ill resented the Imprisonment of the Bishops , and other irregular Proceedings in the late Reign ; ( that might be ) : But then as a further demonstration of his Loyalty , he had put 200 l. into the Exchequer for the use of Their Majesties . What if he had ? so do many others ( that perhaps , are no Friends nor Well-wishers to the Government ) because of the benefit they receive by so doing ; so that all he could do would not make him so honest as he hoped the Court would believe him to be ; for the Court summ 'd up the Evidence on both sides very distinctly to the Gentlemen of the Jury , ( who were men of unbiass 'd Principles , and would not easily be wrought upon ) , telling them , That tho he was troubled at the Imprisonment of the Bishops , and had put his Money into the Exchequer , any man might be and do so , and yet be disaffected , for it was well known how sensible the Bishops were of their Troubles themselves , and yet for all that it was as well known too , how they acted afterwards , and what a great Defection they made ; and altho a man had been a Friend formerly to the present Government , yet he may be against it now , notwithstanding all his pretences to the contrary ; and that there was nothing tended more to the weakning of this Government , and breaking the Confederacy , than to tell the world , That the States of Holland will not let their Fleet go out another year ; and that these things were of very great consequence , and therefore it behoved them to consider well of the matter ; and if they believed ( from any thing that they had heard ) , That Mr. Dyer was guilty of this Offence , then they ought to find him so ; but if not , they must acquit him . The Gentlemen of the Jury having considered of a Verdict , they brought Mr. Dyer in Guilty of a Misdemeanor upon both Indictments . [ Fine . See summary . ] [ Provide sureties for good behaviour . See summary . ] Abraham Stacey , the Noted High-way Man , that has made such a noise abroad who shot the Constable in Fleetstreet when he was taken , and was once burnt in the hand , and not long since received the benefit of Their Majesties most gracious Pardon ; was now indicted for a Robbery on the High-way , committed upon Henry Crisp , Esq ; and one Mr. Hawtrey between Stradford and Illford , to which indictment he pleaded guilty ; and pleaded the Good Services he had done since his Confinement ; giving a Petition to the Court , which set forth the Contents thereof . The Court told him he had been a Notorious Offender , and therefore must expect no mercy here ; withal exhorting of him to mind nothing , but to prepare himself for another World . [ Death .
