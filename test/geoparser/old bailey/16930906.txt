There were two pair of Shears found in the House , and a vast quantity of Clippings : And there were two Women tried before for the same Fact . The Witness could not say she was in the House at that time , neither could they charge her with Clipping . This Fact was done about a Twelvemonth ago , the Prisoners Evidence declared that she was at Epsom at the same time : The Evidence was only Circumstantial , so she was found Not guilty John Wilkinson was indicted , for that he being a Dishonest man , and of an evil Principle , he did receive , harbour , and comfort several Thieves and Highway-men , particularly one Christopher Pickering alias Vicars , a great and notorious Highway-man and Robber , which he did on the 10th of January last .

Furthermore , at the same time the Prisoner went to one Mr . Kitchen a Counsellor of the Temple for Advice ; and he bid him make over his Goods to some Friend , and then he might be safe : And that the said Mr Kitchen made the Prisoner a Bill of Charges , in which Bill he set down paid the Recorder of London 20 l. and his Son a Fee , and treating the Grand-Jury , and other Sums , & c. which was not true ; and was made appear to the contrary in Court : Yet the Jury looking upon the Evidence not to be a sufficient proof against him , though the Court was of opinion that he was an Ill man , they acquitted the Prisoner . Margaret Mason was tryed for breaking the House of Ann James of Stepney , and taking away a pair of Sheets value 25 s. five Shirts 15 s. and other Goods , & c. but Mrs. James leaving her in the House in trust by her own consent , it could not be made a Robbery ; so the Indictment was quash 'd , and the Prisoner Discharged .

( Court ) How did he say he would do it ? ( Witness ) Why he said that he would go with those Ships that he should have , and when he came to Jarsey and Guernsy , he would tell them that he was driven in thither by the French , & c. all this was look 'd upon but as a frivolous Story , and not credited by the Court : This Mrs. Stephens being asked what Countrey and Religion she was off , she answered that she was a Scotch-woman and a Jacobite ; and being ask 'd what a Jacobite was in his Nature , she would give no Answer , but if the Parson had instructed her better , she might have been better provided : The Parson declared that she was abetted to swear against him in this matter by two Jesuit Converts , who turn their Religion any way to serve their own turns , which they do by Mental Reservation , & c. The Court directed the Jury , and told them , that it was but a frivolous and a groundless Indictment : So he was acquitted .

To which Indictment he pleaded not guilty ; and was ordered to remain in Prison till next Sessions . The Tryal of William Newbolt , and Edward Butler , Printers , for High-Treason , in composing and imagining the Death of their Most Sacred Majesties , King William , and Queen Mary . ON Friday the 8th of this instant September , being the 3d Day of this Sessions the Prisoners were brought to the Bar , and were arraigned upon an Indictment of High Treason , for composing , printing and publishing a libellous and traiterous Paper , Entituled , The late King James 's Declaration , & c. To which Indictment they both pleaded Not guilty : And then the Jury was call 'd over , and the Prisoners having made their Challenge to the number of 26 , the Court proceeded upon their Tryal ; and the Gentlemen sworn to try the Issue , were these whose Names follow . William Underhill , Esq ; William Withers , Esq ; Francis Chapman . Henry Jones . Henry Bradberry . Edmond Salter . Gent . Andrew Cook . John Skynner . Richard Bowler . Richard Richman . Samuel Lynn . John Preston . Gent . Then the Prisoners desired they might have Pen , Ink and Paper allow 'd them ; which was granted ; and then the Indictment was read again , which set forth , That the Prisoners stood indicted by the Names of William Newbolt , and Edward Butler , of the Parish of St. Margarets Westminster , Gentlemen ; for that they not having God before their eyes , but being moved and instigated by the power of the Devil , and being Enemies of our Sovereign Lord and Lady the King and Queen , and minding and intending to raise War and Rebellion in this Kingdom , and the Government of this Kingdom wholly to subvert , alter and change , and a miserable Slaughter amongst Their Majesties Subjects to make ; and to depose and put to death Their Most Sacred Majesties ; on the 20th Day of May last past , and divers other times as well before as after , they did compose , print and publish , or cause to be compos 'd , printed , and publish 'd a most false and scandalous , malicious and Traiterous Libel , Entituled , His Majesty 's Most Gracious Declaration , & c. which was publickly read at large : And their Majestys Counsel having very fully and learnedly opened the Matter of Fact that would be fully proved by several Witnesses against the said Prisoners . Then the Evidence for the King and Queen were called and sworn ; the first of which deposed , That about the 20th of May last , he was in company of the Prisoners at the Ship in Charles-street in Covent-Garden , where they Dined ; and after Dinner the man of the House brought up word that one Capt . Griffis was below , and wanted to speak with Mr. Newbolt ; he went down , and when he came up again , he told the Company that Capt . Griffis wanted 10000 of the Declarations for the use of the Country , and that he would give 15 l. for them ; about four or five days afterwards he being there again , Mr Butler pulled a Declaration out of his pocket , one Mr. Farr being there at the same time , lookt upon it , and said , That it wanted the King 's Arms to it , and the Letters , God save the King ; so Farr said at last , Come , we will go to my Lords and do it , ( meaning at Douglass 's where the Printing-Press stood ) which was to set the Declaration ; and after , on the 1st of June following , he met Butler in Charles-street again , and then had some Declarations about him , but his heart failed him , and so gave them to this Witness ; soon after which they were apprehended with those Declarations wet in their custody ; and they were carried before Sir John Trenchard , where they confess 'd the matter ; and thirty of them found upon Butler . Another Evidence swore that the Prisoners had a Printing-Press , and this was kept at one Douglosses at Westminster , and there they printed the Declarations , and that both the Prisoners were concerned equally in the matter , and that they were seen to compose the Press ; and the Frame so set by their hands was brought into Court , on which the Declaration had been printed , and proved to be set by the Prisoners , & c. All this was fully and clearly sworn against them by the King 's Evidence ; and that they once made their escape . The Prisoners did not deny the Fact , nor that they did Print this Declaration , but alledged that it could not be Treason to Print ; for nothing could be accounted Treason but what was contained in the 25th of Ed . 3 . And Printing was not in that Statute , therefore Printing could not be an Overt-Act of High-Treason ; and that they were but Servants , and hired to work for their Livelihood , the Press not theirs , & c. therefore they hoped that they could not be found guilty of Treason , and that it was never known , that Servants did suffer for their Masters Faults . But they were answered by the Court , That Servants and Masters too were equally principals ; and the Matter contain 'd in that Paper was Treason of the highest rate , designing to change the Government , depose Their Majesties , and raise open War in these Nations , of which Design they could not be ignorant , being the Composers and Printers thereof , and all done with setled purpose and intent to be published throughout the Nation , to accomplish and effect the same . Then the Jury having considered of the Evidence , after about an hours time they brought this Verdict , That they were both Guilty of High-Treason . When they received Sentence , they desired Mr . Recorder to make a favourable Report of their Circumstances to the Queen ; And that they were Poor men , and only work 'd for a Living . Who told them , That he would report to their Majesties nothing but what should be just and true , and advised them to repent of their wicked and evil Purposes , and to thank Almighty God that they were prevented , and these Nations blessed in the safety and preservation of the best and most religious King and Queen that ever did rule and govern these Realms . [ Death . See summary . ] John Lord of St. Margarets Westminster , was tried for Clipping the Currant Money of England . The Evidence for their Majesties were the same that were against Barber and the two Wilkinsons , and the like Case as you may see in their Trials aforesaid : The Prisoner was found at Dinner ; but the Court finding that the Prisoner bringing his Trial so suddenly on , and the King 's Evidence being somewhat unprepared , there might be some Trick in the matter , so the Prisoner was ordered to remain in Custody till next Sessions . Ann Jones Wife of William Jones , Alice Sebbin and Elizabeth Dimblebey , were all three tried upon two Indictments of High-Treason , for that they together with William Jones not taken , did first Coin the Currant Money of England ; secondly for Clipping of it : The Evidence swore that the Prisoners were found in the House , but Jones the owner of it was gone ; there was found in the House all manner of Instruments for both Trades ; but Jones being gone away , the Prisoners were set aside , and the Witnesses were bound over to appear next Sessions to prosecute ; in the mean time diligent search is ordered to be made for the said Jones . Margaret Sherwood and Thomas Marsh were tryed for High-Treason , in coining false Money : There was 18 new false Half Crowns found in the House on the 16th of July last , but the Witness not being ready to prove the matter , they were bound in a Recognizance to prosecute them next Sessions ; and the Prisoners ordered to remain in custody till then : So this Jury was discharged from any farther enquiry of them .
