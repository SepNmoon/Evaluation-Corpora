It is the Property of John Barton . There was seventeen Pound Custom-House Weight , it was worth above 5 s. a Pound . - It was about an Hour after they went out of the Shop before I missed it . - I can not tell whether there was any other Customer in the Shop , between the Time of their going out and my missing it .

We sold it to one Elizabeth Bartfoot for five Shillings a Pound . I think it came to 4 l. 5 s. - Briers is transported + for another Fact . - I am in Custody of the Keeper of Newgate .

Thomas Clarke . I went to Church on Sunday the 22d of August , and when I came back I found my Drawer open , it is a Drawer in a Chest of Drawers ; and about two o'Clock this Lad came Home a little fuddled . He had lived with me about three Months . - Mr James ( the next Witness ) was with him , and he begged Pardon , and said he would never do so any more . - He begged Pardon for being Drunk , for he had not been charged with any thing . - I was asked if I had sent him to receive any Money for me , and I said no : Upon this I went to my Drawer , took the Bag out , and laid the Money on the Table , and there seemed to be a good deal less than there was . I missed a 3 l. 12 s. presently . I could not make him confess any thing , so I carried him before a Constable , and he went to the Round-House . I sent for Mr James and asked him if he knew any thing of it , Mr James said , there was one 3 l. 12 s. two 36 s. Pieces , and four Guineas , which he left in his Hand the Day before at Welsh-Fair . I went to the Boy at the Round-House , and he confessed he pushed back the Lock with a Knife , and took out the Money ; he said the Devil told him where the Money was , and that the Devil bid him do it ; he own 'd the 3 l. 12 s. the two 36 s. Pieces , and the four Guineas , and said that was all he took . Mr James . I think the 22d of August , I saw this Boy drinking with three or four Carpenters in Welsh-Fair . I was drinking a Pint of Beer , and seeing him throwing his Money about , I asked him what Country-Boy he was , he said he was out of Wales ; I advised him to go Home , he desired me to drink some Ale ; perhaps , said he , you may think I can not pay for this Ale , though my Hat on my Head is not worth Six-pence , yet I can pay for it , and pulled out one 3 l. 12 s. the Boy said he did not care to go Home , for fear his Master should beat him . I said if he would go Home along with me , his Master should not beat him : Said he , I will give you two Guineas . if you will let me go about my Business ; no , said I , I can not do that , then , said he , take it all . - I thought as he was a little in Liquor , his Master would be angry with me , and think I kept him out , so I would not deliver the Money till Mr Clarke came to me . Said Mr Clarke to me , Have you not two Guineas of my Boy 's ? Yes , said I , I have a great many two Guineas . On Monday Morning he confessed he took four Guineas , two 36 s. Pieces , one 3 l. 12 s. Prisoner . I did not open the Drawer , I found it open , and that Man , James , made me drunk . Q . Can you tell whether the Drawer was locked ? Clarke .

No . 16 . Mary How . I live at Kingsbury , in the County of Middlesex , my House was broke open the 2d of this September . I locked the Door before I went out , but I did not leave any Body in the House . When I came back , I found my House broke open , - the Wall of a back Apartment belonging to my Dwelling-House , the Wall was broke into my Cellar ; seeing that broke , I went up Stairs , and found two of my Drawers open , and missed the Goods and Money mentioned in the Indictment . I live in a lone House . Q . Do you know any thing how the Prisoner at the Bar came to be taken up for this ? How . This Woman was in my Yard , and she described the Man to me . I went to a Farmer hard by , and told him what had happened , and described the Man to him as the Woman had described him to me ; and he pursued him and took him , and the Things were found upon him before I came up , and he desired me to be favourable to him , for that if he was to go before a Justice , he should be a dead Man . John Twyford . I am a Neighbour of this Mrs How 's , she sent me Word by a Woman , that her House was broke open by a Man that worked for me , - he had worked for me about a Month , and I had turned him off . I sent a Man that works for me one Way , and I went another , and when I came to Hendon Church , there was one Hutchins said that he saw such a Man by the Plough ; that he had a good deal of Money , and he believed he did not come honestly by it . I saw the Prisoner laid down in a Ditch on his Face , and he seemed to be fuddled ; the Constable and I searched him , and found all the Things mentioned in the Indictment , and three Pound twelve Shillings . in Silver and Gold ; there was three Handkerchiefs found upon him , he said he took four , but had given one away ; he said at first that we had no Business to stop him , and if we did he would give us trouble for it ; but he confessed it afterwards , he said he crope in at that Place , and crope out there again afterwards . When they are in that Place , they can go all about the House . This is the Purse , I think they say it is a Hart Skin . [ The Things were produced in Court . ] Mrs How . These are all mine , particularly the Purse . There were more Witnesses , but the Court thinking these sufficient , they were not examined . Guilty , Death . 58 . Matth.ew Booney , of Stepney , was indicted for that he , on the 29th of April last , on the King 's Highway , in and upon one Abraham Goodwin did make an Assault , and put the said Abraham Goodwin in Fear and Danger of his Life , and took from him a Watch , val . 5 l. 5 s. a Seal , val . 2 s. a Snuff-Box , val . 20 s. and 18 d. in Silver , the Property of the said Abraham Goodwin . Abraham Goodwin . On Thursday the 29th of April , between Ten and Eleven at Night , between Bow and the Alms-Houses at Mile Edd , ( it was a fine Moon-shiney Night ) I saw two Fellows standing upon the Causeway , on the Right-Hand Side of the Road , each of them had a Pistol in his Hand : They demanded what I had , I told them I would deliver all if they would use me well ; the first thing I delivered was a Seal with a Coat of Arms , with a String , and this Case of a Watch ; he said , Damn your Blood , what is become of the Guts ? I said , Gentlemen , I had forgot it , and gave them that ; then they took from me a Snuff-Box , 18 d. ( and a Handkerchief , and some Half-pence , which is not in the Indictment ) and they made off towards Bow , in the Middle of the Road . I being apprehensive of meeting with some Body else , said , Gentlemen , let me speak a Word to you , you have robbed me , give me a Word by which I may save myself , if I should meet with any Body else ; said one of them , say I have spoke with the Captain , or the Carman , but I think it was the Carman . The Prisoner answers to the Heighth of the Person , and I believe him to be the Person , because I observed a Scar on the Right Side of his Cheek . Cavenagh was dressed in a Brown Coat , I verily believe Cavenagh to be one of them . As to Mooney . I could see the Scar better then than I can now , for his Beard was long and black . Prisoner . Gentlemen , pray observe what he says , he says I had a black Beard , and I have no black Beard . Goodwin . His Beard was rather blacker than it is now . [ William Cavenagh sworn . ] Court . Consider now you are admitted as a Witness , and take Care to speak nothing but what is strictly true . William Cavenagh . I will , my Lord . - On the 29th of April last , the Prisoner at the Bar , John Martin , and myself , went towards Bow between Ten and Eleven at Night , when we came by the Sign of Why not beat Dragon , the Prisoner at the Bar and I went on , Martin said behind , and this Gentleman was walking in the Road Way ; each of us had a Pistol in his Hand , and we demanded his Money : He delivered first the Out-side case of his Watch into Mooney 's Hand , and Mooney gave it to me ; I found it was not compleat , but only a Case , and I asked him for the Guts of it , he said , Gentlemen , I forgot it ; I think he put his Hand into his Breeches and pulled it out : I took a Snuff-Box from him , and a Shilling and a Six-pence in Silver , and 1 d. and when he asked what he should say if he met any Body else , I bid him say he had met the Carman . Prisoner . Ask him how long he has been acquainted with me ? Cavenagh . I came acquainted with him about April , by a Woman that bought stolen Goods . - The Watch was sold to a Man that kept an Alehouse . Prisoner . Ask him why he did not swear against me in his first Information ? William Cavenagh . I did mention him in my first Information ; if you please to look into it you will find it , ( the Information was read and it was found to be so ) . - * Lot Cavenagh is no Relation of mine . * The Person on whose Information the Prisoner was committed . See the Trials in Mr Alderman Perry 's Mayoralty , No . 147 , 148 . Prisoner .

William Cavenagh . Ask him if the Prisoner at the Bar is not his own Son ? Moone . No : he is not my Son , I never knew his Mother in my Life , - he never passed for my Son . Court . It is not customary to work on a Sunday , now the 2d of May proves by the Almanack to be on a Sunday . Moone . Yes sometimes it is , in making Coffins , and he did work for me in making Coffins . - I can not tell which Day the Coffin was made . - I can not tell who the Coffin was for , it was an Oak Coffin . - There was no Undertaker , I was Undertaker . Court . Did you supply the whole Funeral ? - Moone . There was no other Funeral than making of a Coffin . - I found out he was in Goal , by some of his Countrymen ; he did not write to me to come . Prisoner . This William Cavenagh said he had nothing against me , that there was nothing but what Lot Cavenagh had against me . Moone . I live at St Giles 's , in one Gerrard Cavenagh 's House . - I have been in London since Sunday was se'nnight . - I came from Dublin a Fortnight ago , for Debt . - a Debt about 10 or 11 l. - I am an Irishman .

I am Clerk to Mr Penny , an Attorney in New Broad street , my Father is a Woolstapler in Broad-street . Guilty , Death . 59. John Lambert , of St Luke 's , Middlesex , was indicted for breaking open the Dwelling-House of William Brittain , about the Hour of two in the Night , and taking from thence sundry Things , to the Value of 28 s. the Goods of Mary Chambers ; a Perriwig , & c. the Goods of John Chambers ; and other Things the Property of William Brittain , in the Dwelling-House of the said William Brittain , May 16 . William Brittain . I have two Houses , one in Golden and the other in French-Alley , which last was the House that was broke open . I was acquainted with it about four or five in the Morning , and went there and found the out side Window open , and the Wall likewise broke . The Prisoner at the Bar has but an indifferent Character . Mary Chambers . I did not lie in that House that was broke open that Night , but I shut it up about ten o'Clock at Night , locked it , and took the Key away to my Master 's other House ; the People were all in Bed , and the Windows fast shut . I went there between six and seven in the Morning , and the Shutters next the Street were broke , and the Things laid in the Indictment were all missing . - The Prisoner frequently came to fetch Things from our Bakehouse . Abraham Foster . The 20th of July last , the Prisoner came to my Shop to be shaved ; after I had shaved him , I took the Wig out of the Box , to comb it out , and casting my Eye into the Work , I found it was the Wig I had made for John Chambers ; we searched his Lodgings , and found a Shirt which Mary Chambers proved to be her Work , and knew by its being made of two Sorts of Cloth . John Chambers . This Wig is mine , I lost it the 16th of May last ; the Prisoner said he bought the Wig in Rag-Fair , and if he had stole it he would not have worn it . Foster . You might have worn it seven Years , and not have been found out , if you had not brought it to my Shop . Prisoner . I bought them in Rag-Fair , I deal in old Cloaths . Mary Powel and Frances Holgate , knew him to deal in Rag-Fair , and gave him the Character of an honest industrious Fellow . Guilty Felony . Acquitted of the Burglary . [ Transportation .

August 8 . the Property of William Pantell . William Pantell . On Sunday , Aug. 8 , as I was selling my Milk , the Woman at the Bar came and snatched my Hat off my Head , and said I should not have it again , unless I would give her a Quartern . She said if I would come up Stairs with her , I should have my Hat ; and when I came up Stairs , she snatched my Watch from me . I thought when she took my Hat , she was in Jest , so I went a little farther to serve another Customer , before I demanded it . I have seen her before , as I have been selling Milk in the Street . - She lived in Love's-Court Shoe-Lane , it was about six o'Clock in the Evening . John Bannister . I was sitting upon the Bench ; and as he was pouring his Milk out of one Kettle into another , she snatched his Hat off his Head , and went up Stairs , and he went up Stairs too . I did not go up Stairs . John Banks , Constable . On Sunday , August 8 . I was sent for into Love's-Court , Shoe-Lane , about six o'Clock in the Evening , and this Boy and she , ( the Prisoner ) were up one Pair of Stairs , says he , Mr Banks , I have lost my Hat and my Watch ; said I to her , give him his Watch , but she would not give it him : The Boy said she had it in the Inside of her Shift , at her Back . So I felt for it and took it from her , it was the Inside of the back Part of her Stays , this is the Watch I took from her . Pantell . I bought it of one Pearce , under St Dunstan 's Church , I am sure this is the Watch she took from me . Prisoner . The young Man called for a Quartern of Gin , and after that a Quartern of Brandy . There was another young Man there , he went down and left us alone : He had no Money , so he said he would go and pawn the Watch ; but he gave me the Watch to pawn , and the Constable took it out of my Bosom . The Jury desired to know her Character . Banks . I believe she is a loose Woman . Court . Was there a third Person there ? Pantell .

Acquitted . 64. Thomas Griffiths was indicted , for that he , on the Ninth Day of July , not having God before his Eyes , and in the Parish of St Giles 's Cripplegate , in and upon Judith Haswell , Widow , with a certain large Piece of Brick , the said Judith Haswell on the upper Part of the Head did hit ; and gave her one mortal Wound of the Breadth of one Inch , and the Depth of half an Inch , of which said Wound the said Judith Haswell did die . He was a second Time indicted on the Coroner 's Inquisition , for the Murder of Judith Haswell . Samuel Walton . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw a Piece of Brick at his Wife . - She asked him to go and carry Malt at the Peacock Brewhouse , he would not go ; but taking up a Piece of Brick , said if she was not easy , he would throw the Brick at her , which he did ; and then said he would throw another if she did not get away ; she said a good while unconcerned , but at Length the Neighbours got her away . * - She never went by any other Name than that of Griffiths . - The Brick was almost as big as my Fist . - He stood five or six Yards from her ; he bid her get away several Times , yet she would not go , and then he threw it at her with his Left Hand , it hit her pretty hard on the Head , and flew behind her . * The Breaks , in this and other Evidence , are to shew , that what follows is in Answer to Questions put to the Witnesses ; which Questions are omitted for Brevity sake , the Answers denoting what they were . Prisoner . Ask him if I did it designedly . Walton . To be sure he did , because he said he would , and did , throw it ; and he said if I say I will throw it , I will be as good as my Word . - I never knew any Harm of the Man before . - I think it was on a Thursday . Robert Rollison . I saw Thomas Griffiths and Judith Griffiths ( as I then thought , I did not know her Name was otherwise before ) go up Three Leg Court , in Whitecross-street , I think it was the eighth of July , it was on a Thursday . I did not see the Brick thrown , but I heard Words pass between the said Thomas Griffiths and his Wife ; he said , Damn your Blood , I will knock your Brains out if you do not get away . I will speak the Truth , for we must all appear before one Tribunal Judge , to be sure ; he said afterwards , God damn your Eyes and limbs , if I have not kill 'd you , I will kill you , and to be hanged for it I do not value it . I heard nothing else worth mentioning . Court . What was it she said to put him in such a Passion ? Rollison . She gave him very provoking Words I do assure you ; she damn 'd him for a Rogue in an illiterate Sort of a Way , for Ignorance and Impudence meet together , it mixes very much , and God will be a righteous Judge . Prisoner . That 's as true a Thing as ever was spoke in this World . Ask him if he did not say he would hang me . Rollison . My Soul , is that apparent . I shall always speak the Truth ; and if I say any thing amiss , I shall ask God 's Pardon , not your 's . I will say nothing to the Blemish of my Escutcheon . Court . Have you at any Time said that you would hang him ? Prisoner . I declare upon my Oath I never did . Margaret Allen . I saw him holl a Brick at the Woman , and saw the Blood come , - it was done with Violence , for it flew from her . - I do not know what Occasion was given for throwing it . - He was about 10 Yards from her - it was about half a Brickbat - I saw him have a second up in his Hand to throw at her , and he said after he had thrown one that he would do the same , for he did not value being hang 'd for such a Bitch as she was . - I believe she lived about 9 Days after this happened . Diana Brislet . I saw the Prisoner at the Bar throw a Brickbat at her Head , - it was thrown at her - I did not know her by any other Name than Judith Griffiths ; she went for his Wife ; he did take up a second Brickbat , and Mr White was the Man that took it from him , for he said , if he had struck her under the Burr of the Ear he might have killed her on the Spot ; the Prisoner said , Damn the Bitch he did not value being hanged for her , for if he did kill her he was sure he should be hanged for her . Charles Wheeler , Surgeon . The Wound she had was down to the Skull , about one Inch and an half long , and the Skull was bare , it was about the Middle of July , she came to my Surgery in Basing-hall Street , these Wounds are frequently healed , but I believe she caught Cold in coming in the Rain , and had a Fever , and that was the Occasion of her Death ; for the Membrane of the Brain was inflam 'd and that caused her Death ; she came to me for a Week , and I complained to the Church warden and said , she would die if she was not got into a better Place , it was for want of a warm Room and Necessaries , I believe , that was more the Occasion of her . Death than any thing else . Thomas Goodman , Surgeon . I attended the Deceased for two Days ; she had a large confused Wound on the upper Part of her Head : The Woman had no Symptoms of a fractured Skull , or any Injury done to the Brain when I attended her ; her Head and Neck were very much tumisied , and all I did prov 'd unsuccessful , the Humour was suddenly repelled and struck into her Brain : I believe she got Cold , as Mr Wheeler has said , and that was the Occasion of her Death . I do not think but that if she had not caught Cold , that the Wound might have been cured : I laid the Skull bare , and carefully examined it after she was dead , and I did not observe any Injury done to the Skull : Sometimes the Skull shall remain whole and there may be a Concussion of the Brain , I searched the Brain very carefully and it look 'd as in dead Bodies . Q . How can he be indicted for the Murder of Elizabeth Haswell , Widow , when the Witnesses say she was his Wife ? Rollison and Walton were called up again , and said they did not know her by any other Name than Griffiths . Mary Petts . I saw Judith Haswell before she departed her Life , and she said her Name was Judith Haswell ; and being asked , whether the Man was her Husband , she said no , and that the Man that gave her the Blow did not do it designedly , or with a design to do her any Damage , for he was in Liquor , and she had provoked him very much , and she desired he might not come to any Damage , for she should not rest in her Grave if he did . Another Witness said she heard the very same Words . The Prisoner in his Defence said , that there was some Malt came into the Peacock Brewhouse , and he went to pump some Water , that she came and rioted him very much , that he took it patiently till he could bear it no longer , and then he took up that Piece of Brickbat and hit her on the Head with it , but not with a Design to do her any Damage . Mary Griffiths . I am a small Relation , - but very little - I am his Aunt : I was Nurse in the Work-house where this Woman died : Her Name was Judith Haswell , she said she provoked him very much , and it was that Provocation occasioned is to be done , and she would not have him die for it for all the World . Rollison . That Woman that swore last is his own Mother , and she owned she was so . Court . You swore you was his Aunt ; there was no Crime in swearing you was his Mother , but there is a Crime in swearing you are his Aunt when you are his Mother . Mary Griffiths . I am his Mother indeed , but I am distracted , I do not know what I say . Judith Knight . I know the Prisoner was always a poor , harmless , inoffensive Fellow , but a little half-witted : She was a sad provoking Woman in Liquor , and would be both Master and Mistress : I was with her about two Days before she died ; and she desired it might not be laid to his Charge . Susan Baily , Elizabeth arlow , and Joseph Hughes gave him the Character of a Peaceable , harmless , honest , laborious Man . Guilty of Manslaughter . [ Branding . See summary . ] 65.

I did not go out of the Room till the Fire was out ; when the Fire was quite extinguished , I moved the Bureau from the Wall , for fear of it 's setting Fire to the Paper Hangings . Then several Neighbours came up , and a Candle was brought ; presently the Desk Part fell down , said I , this is surprizing , it has either been broke open , or was never locked . I looked at it , and the Bolt was shoved back . Soon after this , Mr. Pauncefort came Home . I told him what had happened , he said he had locked his Bureau in the Morning , and left his Money in it , and then he imagined that the Prisoner at the Bar had robb 'd him ; a Constable was sent for , and she was searched by the Constable ; but he did not find it upon her .
