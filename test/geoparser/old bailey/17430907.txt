William Gough . I keep a Publick-House at Mary-bone ; the Prisoner was my Servant ; I missed the Money the 27th of July : I had put it in a Bag in a Box , which was locked up in a Closet ; when I opened the Closet Door , I found the Box had been wrenched open , and this Money was gone ; there was about 50 l. in the Bag , and the Bag was turned upside down ; I took no Notice of it then , but sat up all Night , for fear she should go off in the Night ; the next Morning I examined her , with relation to the Box being open , and the Money ; she denied that she knew any thing of it ; but being further examined , she acknowledged the Money was in the Copper hole in the Wash-house , and the Money was found there , and delivered to the Constable ; it was sealed up before the Justice ; she was asked who put it into her Head to take it , she said , no body but the Devil ; she owned she wrenched the Box open with a Knife . Isaac Sweetman . The Prisoner went up Stairs , I followed her , and told her , I would have her acquaint her Master what she had done with the Money ; and , she said , if he Master would forgive her she would give him the Money ; accordingly I came down with her , and went with her into the Wash-house in the back Yard , and there the Money was tied up in an old Glove , and hid about three or four Inches under Ground , under the Copper-hole ; there were 4 or 5 s. in Silver , but that was not the Property of her Master ; when she acknowledged the taking of it to me , she said , she hoped her Master would forgive her ; I said , I could not say any thing to it ; she said , she wrenched the Box open with a Case-Knife . James Capps . Constable : I was sent for to Mr Gough 's House to take up the Prisoner with a Warrant for threatning his Life , not for stealing of the Money , the Girl was charged with stealing the Money , and deny 'd it ; she went up Stairs to clean herself , and I desired this Man to go along with her ; when she came down again , she cried in a lamentable Manner , and said , if her Master would forgive her , she would produce the Money ; and then went into the Wash-house , and shewed me where it was under the Copper-hole ; when she came before the Justice she confessed the Thing , and beheved it was the Devil put it into her Head . Prisoner . I had lived Servant with my Master about Ten Days , and he used to follow me up and down .

On the 11th of August between three and four in the Afternoon , the Prisoner came to my Shop , and asked if the Gentlewoman was within ; my Man said yes , and brought him to the Parlour where I keep the Lace . - He said he had an Order out of the Country , for seven Yards of Mecklin Lace ; I asked him what Price he would go to , he said about 12 s. a Yard . I asked him , what Breadth he would have it , and he said about an Inch ; then I took out a Box of Lace , and shewed him two Pieces , one of 14 s. per Yard , and the other Half a Guinea . He gave them to me again and said nothing , I took out another Box , and he put his Hand upon one of 13 s. and then he clapped his Hand upon another , and said , I suppose that is dearer . I told him it was 20 s. per Yard ; he bid me Half a Guinea , for what I told him was 13 s. and took up his Hat and Cane , and said , you bad better take my Money , I will give you 11 s. which I could not take , and he went away . I missed the Piece of Lace directly , but I did not know at first but I might have put it into another Box ; it happened to be stopped by Mr Paine the Pawnbroker , who was so kind as to bring it to me , and has kept it in his Custody ever since . He did not come as a Dealer in Lace , but as a Sort of a Gentleman . - This is the Piece of Lace that I missed at that Time . Maltus Paine . On the 11th of August , about three or four in the Afternoon , the Prisoner brought me a Piece of Lace to pledge ; I have had some little Dealings with him before , and he has told me he was a Lace Merchant ; the Night before this , I happened to have some small Information from a Gentleman who has another Indictment against the Prisoner , that he had lost a Piece of Lace which I had taken in , and that gave me some Suspicion of the Prisoner ; that was the Thing that brought this to light , or else I had taken this Piece in from him ; for I took him to be a Man of Reputation and Character ; he asked me five Guineas upon it ; I asked him whose Property it was , he said , it was his own ; I said , it is very possible it may be your own ; but I am informed that I have a Piece in my Custody that you brought me that is not your own , and I will know whose this is ; so I stopped him , and had him before a Justice - he did not make any Confession , he said , he received it from a Perriwig maker that was making Wiggs for him - I believe I should not have lent him five Guineas upon it - he said it was his own , and that he dealt in Lace - he did not seem surprized , he was not under any Confusion - I have made it my Business to enquire after him , and People give him but a very indifferent Character - this is the same Piece I had of the Prisoner . John Hull . Aug. 11 . I went to Mr Paine 's Shop the Prisoner was in the Shop , and Mr Paine had this Piece of Lace in his Hand ; Mr Paine asked him what he would have upon it ; he told him ; Mr Paine asked him how he came by it ; the Prisoner said , Why do you ask me that Question ? I deal in it . Mr Paine said , he must know how he came by it ; so Mr Paine charged me with him , and as we were going along , I stopped at my own Door about a Letter , and the Prisoner was gone in a Minute , he run away , and got into Great Russel Street , I cried out stop Thief , and took him again ; Now , says Mr Paine , you have spoiled all your Innocency , for you would not have run away if you had been innocent ; I asked him where he lived , he said , he had a Lodging in Maiden-Lane Covent-Garden ; and he said before the Justice that his Name was William Day ; he said , he was a Perriwig-maker , and that he traffick 'd Wigs for Lace .

Thomas Wickers . I live at the Red Gate by the Seven-Dials ; I have known him ten Years , and have trusted him in a great many Cases , where he has had Opportunities to wrong me , and I should not very readily have missed any thing , and I always found him honest .

Joyce Mason . I have a first Floor in Mr Pearce 's House , and deal in Lace ; the Prisoner came on the 29th of June , about ten in the Morning , and said he wanted seven Yards of Mecklin Lace , of about 10 s. per Yard ; I shewed him one , he said , he would give me Nine ; I told him I would take no less than Ten ; and that as he seemed not to understand the Value of it , if he paid me the Money , and did not like it afterwards , I would give him the Money again ; I opened another Box , and he put his Hand in and took out a Piece ; I took the Piece out of his Hand , and said they were above his Price ; then he clapped his other Hand , with his Handkerchief in it , upon the Corner of the Box , and I imagine he took the Piece of Lace that way , ( I had put the Piece up again that I shewed him ) and as he went out he offered me 9 s. 6 d. About an Hour and an half afterwards I missed the Piece of Lace that he stole out of the Box that he put his Hand into ; and about three or four Days afterwards I missed five Pieces more , two of six Yards three Quarters , two of six Yards , and two that were but Remnants ; then was I dubious , whether some of my Servants had not stole them : I went to Mr Paine 's , and told him , I had lost several Pieces of Lace , and he was very ingenuous in shewing me what Laces he had ; this is the Piece I had of Mr Paine , the other Piece that I lost then I never had - I am very positive this is my Lace , and that I missed this Piece of Lace the 29th of June : I believe the Lace went all at the same Time , for I never saw the Prisoner since - This is not the Piece that I missed at first - I did not shew this particular Piece of Lace to him - I opened two Boxes of Lace , and this was in one of the Boxes - I missed one Piece out of one Box , and five out of the other - the Night before he came I told my Laces over - I did not tell them over again till three or four Days after he was there . Maltus Paine . Mrs Mason was at my House , and was telling my Wife of her Misfortune , in losing several Pieces of Lace . I said , I have taken in two Pieces , may be one or both may be your 's . I shewed the Lace to her , and she was very positive to this Piece ; this Piece I had of the Prisoner . The next Day afterwards he came with another Piece of about thirteen Yards , and then I stopped him and the Lace too . When he brought this Piece of four Yards and an Half , I asked him several Questions , and he gave me such satisfactory Answers , that really I had no Suspicion of him . I lent him a Guinea upon it . John Hull , the Constable , gave much the same Evidence as in the former Trial , adding , that when Mr Paine charged him with the Prisoner , he said , Why do you stop me , I can bring a great many Persons to my Character , and said he would leave his Goods , and fetch somebody to his Character , but Mr Paine would not let him go , and as I was carrying the Prisoner along , he ran away from me . Q Did he run bravely ? Hull . He ran most stoutly , and said there were Business running after him , but I took him and carried him before Justice Moore , and then he said his Name was William Day , and that he lived sometimes in Goodman's-Fields , and that his Wife kept a Bagnio , I think , he said , the Turk's-Head .

He said he had an Acquaintance hard by , that he would go and fetch them to have their Opinion upon it , and would be back again in Half a Quarter of an Hour . He went out of the Shop , and I did not see him any more . Upon putting the Laces into the Box again , I missed two Yards of broad Mecklin Lace , four Yards and a half of another , and seven Yards of English Lace .

I then acquainted my Fellow-Sufferer , Mr Pearson , with it , and the next Day we went with the Man who keeps the George to the Prisoner 's House : - He keeps a Publick-House , ( the Rose and Crown ) between Marybone and Paddington , and before Pearson came quite up to his House , seeing the Prisoner standing by the Door , Pearson said , he was sure that was the Man that robbed us we went into the House , and had drank two Pots of Beer with the Prisoner , and had some Pipes and Tobacco , and a Quartern of Brandy , and came out of the House without saying any Thing to him about it , at that Time ; the next Morning I got a Warrant from Col.

He had a Surrout Coat , a close bodied Coat , it was a very ordinary thread-bare Coat , with Holes in it , and a narrow brimm 'd Hat . Prisoner . I never had such a Coat . John Pearson . On Saturday in the Afternoon , July 9. Richard Cole and I were stopped on Hounslow-Heath by the Prisoner , about half an Hour after five in the Evening , he said , I must have a little Money of you before you go any farther ; I did not apprehend him at first , for I thought he was only in Joke ; the second Time he spoke pretty sharply ; I got up in the Chaise with my Whip in my Hand , and had a Mind to have struck him ; but seeing another Person , who dropped a Crape over his Face , I kept back ; I gave him half a Guinea in Gold and 3 s. 6 d. in Silver , and then my Watch ; and my Friend gave him a Guinea , a good Handful of Silver , and his Watch ; I said to the Prisoner we are a Couple of Servants came out to take an airing , and I think you have aired us very handsomely : I asked him whether he would not give me something to pay the Turnpike , and he give me a Shilling ; I asked him whether he would not give my Companion something , and , he said , he would not ; the other said , give him something , and then he gave him a Shilling ; the Prisoner said , Now you are richer than we are ; I said it was false ; for they had got our Money , and we had none of theirs ; the Sunday Sev'nnight following , my Mate told me , that he had seen the Man that robbed us , at the George in Piccadilly ; we went to the George , and from thence to the Prisoner 's House ; and before I came to the House , I believe by half the Length of a Field , I saw the Prisoner at his Door , and said , that is the Man that robbed me ; says the Man that kept the George in Piccadilly , are you sure of that ? I said , I am sure of it , we had some Beer and a Quartern of Brandy - I believe this was about five o'Clock when we got to Hanns 's House - That is the very Man that took the Money from me and my Mate , and no body else . Q . How far is the Seven-Dials from Hounslow ? Pearson . I believe about ten Miles . Q Do you think a Man can ride that in about half an Hour ? Pearson .

You say it was better than half an Hour after Five , are you sure it was not turned of Six ? Pearson . It was not . Q . When you were drinking with him , and knew him to be the Person , why did not you lay hold of him then ? Pearson . Because I would be sure before I got a Warrant to apprehend him . John Bowles . I live at the Horse and Groom in George-Yard by Grosvenor square , the Prisoner has hired Horses of me several Times ; for one Day at a Time , never any longer , and always kept very good Hours - I can not swear he had a Horse that very Day - I think it was a Sorrel Horse that he had that Day . Q. to Pearson . Do you know what coloured Horse he was on ? Pearson . I am not well skilled in Horses - I do not know whether it was a Sorrel or a Chesnut ; Mr Bowles said he had a Horse of him , and that he had been upon some secret Expedition . Q. to Bowles . Had you any Discourse with the Prisoner about that ? Bowles Then the Prisoner came back again , I said , with you have any thing to drink , he said , he did not came to drink , he had been drinking pretty hard ; at this he had a Quartern of Brandy , and said , he believed he had done the Business he went about very well - I believe it was between seven and eight in the Morning when he had the Horse . Col. Deveil deposed , that he had received an anonymous Letter , in which was a Silver Watch , with the Name Pearson upon it ; the Watch was produced by him ; and Mr Pearson said , it was the same Watch that he was robbed of the 9th of July on Hounslow-Heath ; that it had John Pearson engraved on the Outside , by which he knew it to be his Watch .

My Lord , I am informed that the Government have not thought fit to prosecute , I desire therefore to be inform 'd who is the * Prosecutor . * A very proper Enquiry , as will presently appear ; but it , unfortunately for the Prisoner , is fix 'd on a Person not able to make him Satisfaction . The Court thereupon inquir 'd , and the committing Justice being upon the Bench , named a Gentleman of Rank in the Army , who soon after acquainted the Court that he was not the Prosecutor ; whereupon William Ross was entered as Prosecutor . William Ross . On the 8th of July last , on a Friday , I met the Prisoner near Charing-Cross . Q . Did you ever see him before ? Prisoner . Never before . Q . What did he say to you at that Time ? Ross . He said to me , what Countryman are you ? I said I was born in Holland . Q . What are you now ? Ross . I belong to General Harrison 's Regiment of Foot . - I am a common Soldier . Q . If you were born in Holland , how then came you to be a Subject of Great-Britain ? Ross . My Father was born in Scotland , he has a Company of Scotch Hillanders ; they call them the Scotch Regiment ; they are in the Service of Holland : My Father is now in Garrison at Art ; He has been in Holland , near fifty Years . Q . How do you know your Father was born in Scotland ? Ross . I have heard him say several Times that he was born in the Shire of Ross . Q . How long have you been in England ? Ross . Three Months and a Half and better . - I have been enlisted in General Harrison 's Regiment since the 25th of May . - I was enlisted when the Prisoner met me . Q . When you met together who spoke first ? Ross . He spoke to me first in French , and said how do you do , do you understand French ? Then I stopped and answered him in French ; said he , I have seen you before ; may be so , said I . Then I went with him to the House of one Miles Carrol , at the Sign of the Green-Man at Charing-Cross . - I had never seen him before : Then he asked for a private Room , and the Man shewed him into a Fore-Room next the Street ; he called for a Pot of Beer , and then for some Victuals . - He talked to me , thinking I was a Subject of the King of France ; I never let him know that I could speak any English . There came a Drawer into the Room , and the Prisoner said to him , Here is a clever Man but he can talk no English at all , and he is afraid he should be taken up , because he is a Roman Catholick . Q What Countryman did you tell him you were ? Ross . I told him I was a Frenchman ; says the Drawer to him , Explain to him in French that he need not be afraid , for I , and my Master and Mistress are all Roman Catholicks . The Drawer went out , and there came in a Chairman , I think his Name is Caibow ; this Chairman thinking I could understand no English , said , if he would take him along with him he would go . - The Prisoner said it was a dangerous Thing to meddle with such Matters here ; then the Chairman was called and went out , so the Prisoner came up to me , clapp 'd his Hand upon my Shoulder , and said , I should be glad to have you for a Comrade , and you shall go with me to France ; says he , I hope you are not against your own King and Country , meaning that I was a Frenchman : He said , if I would go with him , he would give me a Note under his Hand that I should be an Officer as soon as I came on the other Side of the Water ; says he . I will give you 40 Livres . No says I , That is too little for such a Man as I am , I will have more as that - I spoke this in French . He put his Hand in his Pocket , and pulled out a French Crown . which I have here to produce , and said , he would make that 40 Livres more ; ( the French Crown was produced ) this is worth about 4 s. 6 d. English Money ; I took this Crown of him , and he called for a Pot of Beer ; after we had drank the Beer , I was studying how to come out of that House , for fear of being knocked on the Head , as they were all his own Country People . Q . What were they Frenchmen ? Ross . They all spoke French . Q . What Country People do you think they are ? Ross . They are Irish People - the Prisoner is an Irishman ; they talked both English and Irish ; then I made a Proposal to him , that as he was a Man that understood English , and I could not , if he would go along with me down into Wapping to get my Goods , I would go with him where he pleased ; he agreed to that , and pulled out half a Crown , and gave it to the People of the House , for a Lodging for me and himself , and for the Reckoning , which was Fifteen-pence Half-penny - we did not lie there ; this was between five and six o'Clock ; the Prisoner and I went to the Black-Boy and Trumpet at Tower-Hill , and I called for a Pot of Beer , I spoke to the Landlord , and desired him in Dutch to go to St Catharines , to get a File of Musqueteers , but he refused it , and said , I should go myself - the Landlord spoke Dutch - the Prisoner could understand some Words of what we said ; then , I said , I would talk to him in English ; and I told him he was my Prisoner , and I would hold him ; I had no Money in my Pocket , but this Piece , that I had of the Prisoner , and the Landlord would not let us go without paying for the Beer ; said I to the Landlord , keep this in your Custody till I come and pay for the Beer ; then I took the Prisoner out of the House , and carried him before Justice Dennet . Court . This is all mispending of Time ; for the Man took him to be a Frenchman ; we will suppose this Man was a Subject of his Majesty , of which there is some doubt , if he pretends to be a Foreigner , and ca n't speak a Word of English , he is to be taken for what he pretends to be . Acquitted . 408. Susannah Carter , of St Leonard Shoreditch , was indicted for the wilful Murder of Elizabeth Lewis , by casting and throwing of a Knife made of Iron and Steel , value 1 d. * at the said Elizabeth Lewis ; by which casting and throwing she gave her a mortal Wound on the left Side of the Breast , near the Collar Bone , of the Length of one Inch , and the Depth of three Inches , of which Wound she instantly died , July 16 . * In an Indictment for Murder , the Value of the Weapon is found by the Jury ; for the Weapon is a Deodand , forfeited to the King ; and the Township are chargeable for the Value , if delivered to them .

Samuel Fletcher , Surgeon . On the 20th of July , the Church-Warden of Shoreditch Parish came , and desired me to look at the Body of the Deceased , which I did ; and there was a Wound on the upper Part of the left Side of the Body , which penetrated between the first and second Rib , and there was a large Quantity of extravasated Blood lodg 'd upon the Diaphragma ; I am persuaded this Wound occasioned her Death . Ann Price . I live in Kingsland Road , next Door to the Gentleman and Porter , the 16th of July , in the Morning , the Prisoner got up a little before four o'Clock , to hang up some Cloaths for Mrs Hornibrook , and afterwards sat herself down to cut some Matches ; and the deceased Elizabeth Lewis came in pretty much in Liquor ; Susannah Carter , said to the Deceased , You B - h , you have been great with a Butcher in White-chapel for Sweet-Breads and Kidneys - Elizabeth Lewis had a Husband somewhere , but they did not live together . Q . Did Carter begin to quarrel with Lewis , or Lewis with Carter ? Price . They both began to quarrel together ; but Carter 's saying that , made Elizabeth Lewis angry ; and Elizabeth Lewis said to Carter , You B - h , I never gave the Carman the Clap in White-chapel ; then Susannah Carter says to her , Say so again , and I will do you a Mischief ( they lodged in the same House , and both lay together ) the Deceased said the same Words over again ; then Susannah Carter took hold of a Basket , and hurled it on one Side , in order to get to the Door , and threw a little broken Knife out of her Hand , that she was cutting her Matches with - she threw the Knife down , when she went to open the Door to get to the Deceased - they were both in the same Room at first , and Elizabeth Lewis went into the other Room for fear of Mischief , and shut the Door - then Susannah Carter thrust her two Hands against the Door and pushed it open ( I did not see any Thing in her Hands ) and immediately the Deceased came out , and said , Lord , Lord , look how she has stabbed me ; she was stabbed in the Breast , on her left Side . Q . Did the Knife slick in ? Price . I did not see the Knife till it was found bloody ; then , I said , Betty Lewis is in a Fit , and I got a little Water ; but all we could do was to no Purpose , for she died presently . Q . What did Susannah Carter say ? Price . Susannah Carter owned she did it , and did not desire to go away - the Deceased died in about four Minutes . Q . Did the Prisoner shew any Concern about it ? Price . She did not look much concerned . Mary Brown . I was lying upon a Couch , where the Prisoner was sitting , cutting of Matches ; I was asleep , but the Noise waked me ; when I awaked , I heard the Prisoner say , You B - h , I never was concerned with the Butcher in White-chapel for Sweet-Breads and Kidneys ; the Deceased made answer , and said , I never gave a Butcher nor a Carman the Clap in White-chapel ; the Prisoner said , if you say so again I will do you a Mischief ; the Deceased rehearsed it over again ; and being in Liquor , aggravated the Prisoner very much ; the Deceased was in another Room - the Door was shut when these Words passed ; there was but a slight Partition , that they might hear very well - the Deceased began first , for she was very much in Liquor . Q . Was the Deceased in Bed or up ? Brown . She was in Bed ; the Prisoner then opened the Door - there was no Lock upon the Door , it was a Sort of a Spring Bolt , tied with two Strings , and they were twisted round a Nail ; and the Door was easily got open ; the first Thing I saw , was , that the Prisoner laid hold of a Knife ; which , I suppose , was the first Thing that came to her Hand - it lay upon a Chest of Drawers , and she flung it at the Deceased - I saw her sling it . Q . Then she did not stab her ? Brown . No , she flung it at her , and she received a Wound under the Collar-Bone , on the left Side ; and the Deceased said , Lord , Lord , see how she has stabbed me . Jury . Stabbing implies a sticking with the Knife in her Hand ; did she strike her with it in her Hand , or did she throw it at her ? Brown . She flung it , I do assure you . Jury . At what Distance was it flung ? Brown . About two Yards and an half - then the Deceased said , Lord , Lord , see how she has stabbed me ; and the Prisoner said , I am sorry for it ; and if I have done it , I am willing to suffer , I will not run away . Q . Do you upon your Oath say she threw it at her ? Brown . She flung it at her , I do assure you - I will never vary a Tittle for the best Person upon Earth . John Rumbold . I am a Parish Officer ; I was called up at five o'Clock in the Morning ; when I came into the House I saw a Woman lying dead ; I asked who did it ; the Prisoner said , she did it , and that she was sorry for it ; I told her , she would be hanged , she said , she could not help it . Prisoner . I got up between three and four o'Clock that Morning , and was cutting of Matches , when she came in drunk ; I got some Gin for her , and she would have had me have got some Tobacco ; and as I would not do that , she abused , and aggravated me very much , and , I said , I would lick her ; but my Landlady hindered me , says she , let her come ; and as I could not come to her , I took up the Knife , and threw at her .

Then the Record was read . Q . Do you know the Prisoner to be the same Man that was tried and convicted at Chelmsford , for the Robbery which is set forth in this Record ? Nathaniel Harris . Yes , I was at Chelmsford at the same Time , and gave Evidence against him ; when he was brought to the Bar , he pleaded Guilty . Q . Are you sure he is the same Person ? Harris .

I cried out Stop Thief , and Paine stopped him . - I am a Printer , and live on the Road-side , between Bow and Stratford . Q . Did he make any Excuse for being at large ? Burdeaux . None at all ; he begged and prayed that I would not prosecute him , for if I did he was a dead Man . Thomas Paine . On Saturday was Fortnight , the 27th of August , I was in Whichapel Butcher-Row , and hearing a Cry of Stop Thief , I turned my Head and saw the Prisoner spring by me very swift , and he turned into Somerset Street , in Aldgate Parish . I being a Headborough of St Mary Whitechapel , I run after him , but being slip-shoed I could not run fast enough , I cried Stop Thief ; knock him down . Then he crossed from one Side of the Way to the other . I came up with him , and seized him by the Collar , which gave Way , so I thrust my Knuckles into his Throat , he said , for God's-Sake let me go , I have done no Harm , I have only returned from Transportation ; said I , I will stay till the Prosecutor comes up . The People bid him go , and the Mob grew outragious ; when Mr Burdeaux came up , he desired I would assist him , and said , that the Prisoner had robbed him , and had returned from Transportation , and that he had threatned Destruction * to him and his Family : I pushed him along as fast as possible towards my Lord-Mayor's-House ; the People called us all the Thief-takers they could think of ; the Mob arose in Battle-array , so that I said to the Prosecutor , I would assist him no further ; but he begged I would . We got him into a Coach , and Dirt was thrown into the Coach by two Women , whom I took particular Notice of . I put him into the Poultry-Compter , and the next Day had him before the Alderman , he acknowledged himself to be the Man , and begged for Mercy ; he said , he had suffered a great deal , and begged the Prosecutor that he would not take away his Life ; he behaved himself very civilly all the Way . * At the Time they were conveying the Prisoner from Chelmsford , in order to be transported , as he pass 'd by the Prosecutor 's House , he threw Stones at Mrs Burdeaux , which broke the Windows , and narrowly miss 'd her , using this Expression , G - d d - n you , you B - h , take that .

I asked Mr Eades that , and he said he had no Son , so he could not be going in his Son 's Room . Prisoner . I shipped myself at Philadelhia , the 15th of March , and was to take a Loading of Tar , and then to go to Leith in Scotland . I said to the Captain , it was very dangerous for me to go to London , for I shall be taken up for returning from Transportation ; he said I should never fair out of the Ship ; he said he would put in at Cowes , and instead of going to Cowes , he came to London ; so I ventured on Shore , and there was a Gentleman 's Son who was going on Board a Man of War , and I was to go in his Room , and to have five Guineas for it , and was going to the White-Hart in Lemmon-Street about it . I was told to take Care not to come in Mr Burdeaux 's Way ; it was but the fifth Day that I had been in London ; the Ship arrived at London the 10th , and I was taken the 27th .

She was a second Time charged on the Coroner 's Inquisition for the said Murder . Catherine Collins . I lodged with the Prisoner ; my Brother , the Deceased , used frequently to come and see me , and upon this Day three Weeks he came between nine and ten in the Morning , and this Accident happened about 4 o'Clock in the Afternoon , during which Time we had three half Pints of Brandy , between the Prisoner , one Mrs Stewart , an Acquaintance of her 's , my Brother , and I ; I believe my Brother did not drink half a Glass of it . Mrs Stewart laid down upon the Bed , and the Prisoner said , my Brother went to put his Hand under her Petticoats , and he said , I had no Intention to put my Hand under her Petticoats , I had no Thoughts of it ; he said he only laid his Hand upon her , and thought no Harm in it . Then the Prisoner began to curse and swear , and called him a great many Names , and said he had a great deal of Impudence to meddle with any Body in her Apartment , that she was no Companion for him ; my Brother said , What is that to you , I will do as I please ; the Prisoner made Answer , No , you Rogue , you shall not do as you please in my Apartment , and she took up a short Hearth-Brush , and gave him several Blows upon the Head with it ; What , says he , are you in earnest ? Yes , said she , I am , you Dog . Then he took the Brush out of her Hand , and slung it away ; then she took up the Bar of the Grate , and was going to knock him down with that ; he took the Bar out of her Hand , and threw it away ; then she took hold of him by the Hair of his Head , and he endeavouring to get her Hand out of his Hair , scratched her on the Face , and gave her a Push from him , and she fell down backward ; then she started up again , took up the Poker , and gave him a dead Stroke on the right-side of the Temple . Q . Did she strike him with great Violence or no ? Collins . She did it designedly to be sure , for she said before the struck him , You Son of a Where . I will knock your Brains out ; - it a had she could strike him ; the Poker has a little sharp Point , which was wore away with the Fire , and was like a crooked Nail ; it run into his Temple so that there was a Hole I could put the Top of my Little-finger into ; when he received the Blow he said , I am murdered , and the Blood and Tears ran down from his Face , and so the Tears did from mine . - She knocked him dead down with the Blow , - it was a small Poker , about the Bigness of my Finger , not three Quarters of a Yard long ; - he cried out Murder , and I cried out Murder ; he bled about half a Pint . Q . How did the Prisoner behave ? Collins . She thought nothing of it , she said , he gave her more than she gave him , and did not Care if she had given him six Times as much ; then my Brother and I went away ; we had two Pints of Beer at an Alehouse , and he said he would go to his Lodging . Jury . Was there no Surgeon applied to ? Collins . No . my Brother took no Notice of it for two Days - The Deceased was a Glover and Breeches Maker ; - he could do no Business after he received that dead Stroke , and did not eat a Morsel , till Death took him , but he drank pretty much Small-Beer and Pump-Water , and that would come up again before it was well down in his Belly : - He received the Wound on Thursday , and was turned cat of his Lodging on Friday Night , and on Saturday Night he got another . - I was with him when he died . Q . Was he sensible when he died ? Collins . He was a little headful some times , but he came sensible about Half an Hour before his Death , when I got him a Pint of Ale , and rais 'd him up to drink it , and after he had drank it , he fell off my Arm like a great Stone , and never spoke afterwards . Q . Had he any Physician or Surgeon ? Collins . No , he did not mind it for two Days , though the Wound run with Blood and Water , and his Face was swelled as big as three Faces . Coroner . The Parish where he died would be at no Charge , and no Surgeon would come near him . Mary Grant . He came to my House , on the Saturday Night , between six and seven in the Evening , and said , the Woman that was drinking with me on Tuesday Night , has given me a Blow with a Poker , that has given me my Death 's Wound ; and when I am dead she will be hanged for me . James Flit . On the Saturday Night , between nine and ten , I saw the Deceased at Mrs Grant 's and he said , Mrs Mackintosh had given him his Death 's Wound ; he cried out facly , and said , if he could not be blooded he should die in a Minute , that he had a Pain about his Heart , and desired me to lend him a Hand into St Catherines ; I went with him to a Barber 's Shop and desired him to bleed him ; and , he said , it was a Thing of a very dangerous Consequence , and did not care to do it . Mary Caddy . The Deceased came to our House on the Saturday Night , when my Mother and I were not at Home ; and some of our People took him in ; and my Mother was angry , and said , it was hard to bury a Man for one Night 's Lodging ; the Woman that was with him ( his Sister ) called us up ; I went , and found that he drew his Breath very slow ; I said to her , pull him straight , for I thought he was dying ; and the Woman cried , and said , he was murdered by one Mackintosh ; I got an Officer , and went to take her up : says the Deceased 's Sister , you must be pretty sly about it , or she will get away ; I left the Officer at an Alehouse , because she should not be apprized of the Thing ; I knocked at her Door , and said , Mrs Mackintosh I want to speak to you ; she opened the Door , and I thought looked a little surprized at seeing a Stranger ; I said , there was some-body wanted to speak with her at the Black-Boy ; she said , she would not go ; I got within the Door , to prevent her shutting of it ; said I , What are you guilty of any Thing that you are afraid of going ; may be , I am , said she ; I got within the Door , and caught fast hold of her , and cried out for Help ; one of the Men at the Alehouse came and took her ; says I , you are a vile Jade , you have murdered a Man , and he is now dead at my Mother 's House ; she said , he would have murdered her - she said , she hit him with a Poker ; and that he run to the Grate , and took a Bar off , and hit her with it ; and that the twisted the Bar out of his Hand ; I can not be positive whether , she said , she struck him first ; she said , he had abused her ; and if she had not killed him , he would have killed her Capt . John Jell . ( High Constable ) On Sunday Morning , Aug. 21 . I heard a Noise in the Square , between six and seven in the Morning , and was informed , that a Woman was taken up ; I went to enquire about it , and found the first Evidence in the Cage ; I asked the Reason , and they told me it was upon Suspicion of Murder ; while I was talking , one of the Headboroughs came with the Prisoner at the Bar ; and , they said , This is the Woman that has done the Injury to the Man ; I asked her whether she had struck the Man ; she said , she had ; said I , what did you strike him with ? She said , with the Bar of the Grate : then , said I , with that you killed him , for the Man is dead ; she clapped her Hands together , in this Manner , having a Child in her Arms , and said , God forbid , and sat herself down , and cried . Prisoner . Collins made it her brags , that if she did not hang me , she would bring enough that should . - Collins . I never declared any thing to that Effect - I never mentioned it ; I said , I could not tell what would be done to her , for to be sure she murdered him , and she deserves to be hanged . Prisoner . She said she had murdered her Husband , and had got seven Pounds for it ; and that , she would hang me , if she did not get a Farthing for it . The Deceased gave me thirty Strokes upon my Shoulders , Thighs , and Hips ; it is very strange , that a strong Man should take any Thing from such an ailing Woman as I am ; he called me a thieving B - h ; I said , I never did thieve any Thing in my Life ; then he gave me several Blows , and I cried out , to awake these two Women , who were upon the Bed , Sarah Stewart , and his Sister ; his Sister got off the Bed ; I was then all in a gore Blood , and he had tore my Cap off my Head . Q . Did you see her with her Cap off or bloody ? Collins . She had not a Drop of Blood upon her , but what came from him . Prisoner . Stewart awoke soon after , and said , Lord ! what is the Matter with you ; and , he said , bad Luck to you , you Gallows Thief , I will you to Death ; and he gave me two Stroke with the Poker , and spit in my Face ; I said , You will not serve me as you did the Woman you killed before ; and I took the Poker to protect myself , and gave him a Stroke on the Head , but I did not think to kill him . Q . How came you by the Poker ? Prisoner . I took it out of his Hand , at the Time he spit in my Face , and called me thieving B - h. Frances Jones The Prisoner 's Husband is my Brother ; my Husband and I were coming by the Prisoner 's Door about one o'Clock , and heard a Cry of Murder ; I went in , and saw Obrian , the Deceased , his Sister ( Collins ) the Prisoner , and Mrs Stewart .

The Prisoner said , the Man had murdered her ; she had her Child in her Arms . Q . What Marks were there upon her ? Jones . She was all over bloody , and could hardly take Breath with that I called him Villain ; he called me a great many B - hes , and said , he would give me as much , if I spoke another Word ; with that I took the Child , and came away . Q . How came you to leave them under such Circumstances ? Jones . Because my Husband would not let me stay ; the Deceased being such a vile Fellow . Q . Did you see any Marks of Violence upon Bryan ? Jones . Not a Mark in the World . Q . Did he complain of any Thing ? Jones . Nothing at all - the Deceased two Days afterwards sent for the Prisoner , and desired to make it up , and said , he bore her no Malice , and would had her have drank with him , but she would not ; Collins was there , at the same Time , and desired her not to bear Malice . Q. to Collins . Did not you see this Woman two Days after this ? Collins . This Woman was not within the House all the Time that I lived there ; all that she says is false ; her Sister has not seen her these twelve Months . Q . Was not you before a Magistrate , to give an Account of this Affair ? Collins 's Examination taken by Justice Richards was read , and agreed with the Evidence she now gave . The Justice being asked , what Condition the Prisoner was in , when she was brought before him ; the Justice said , he believed , she had twenty Scratches all over her Cheeks and Forehead . Prisoner . The Deceased and his Sister went on Thursday Night to the Black Boy and Trumpet by the Ditch Side ; and they being troublesome when they are in drink , they turned them out of the House ; he said , he was followed by a Press Gang , and that they abused him very much ; but that he did not mind his being beat , if he had not lost his Hat ; and that was the Occasion of his Death . Q . Do you think that his being abused by the Press-Gang was the Occasion of his Death ? Collins . There is nothing in it ; I do not blame her , for endeavouring to save her Life - he was not abused by my Press Gang - I do not know any thing of his losing his Hat . Mrs Grant . The Tuesday Night he was at our House , and say there ; I did not see him again till the Saturday Night ; and then , I told him , I had not Conveniency for him ; and gave him 2 d. to get him a Lodging ; his Neck was swelled up even with his Chin , and if it had not been for his Voice , I should not have known him - he talked very reasonably . Q. to Collins . Where did you go to on Thursday Night , after you had been at the Alehouse ? Collins . We parted at the End of the Lane ; and , he said , he was going to his Lodging ; I met him the next Morning , and between six and seven in the Evening ; and then , he went to Mrs Johnson 's , and lay there ( she keeps a Lodging House ) Mrs Grant was afraid he should die in her House , and so would not let him come there . Guilty , Manslaughter . [ Branding .

Joseph Cook . On the 8th of June , I was going along the Road to Harefield , in a Cart , with one Horse , with Mrs Horabin , Mrs Hildersry , and my Wife ; I was going down the Hill , and saw three Carts coming up ; the Road was there fifteen Foot and an half wide ; I got off the Cart , and drawed out of the Track which I was in , three or four Inches , and stood up against the Bank ; so that I think the Prisoner might have gone by without coming upon the Cart we were in ; and if he had gone on the other Side of the Lane , there would have been Room enough for a Man to have stood between the Wheels of the two Cart ; the Road was not at all dangerous ; it was a dry Time ; I never knew an Instance of any Cart being overturned there : About five Yards before he came up , to me , I said , honest Friend , or Fellow , he so good as to bold to ; with that he took hold of his Horse 's Head - he was on the right Side , where he ought to be ; he took hold of his Thill Horse Halter , but never spoke a Word ; when he came nearer to me , I said or for God 's Sake , hold off ; but instead of that , he hold nearer to me , and pushed the batt End of his Whip against the Horse 's Head , and drove him towards me ; and the Wheel went out of the Track , and came against my Wheel ; I cried out , for God Sake , stop your Horses - I thought he was very sober , it was about eleven o'Clock in the Morning - the Woman that were in my Cart were sitting in Chairs , and I thought they were very safe then , for the Wheel was locked in ; but the Wheel of his Cart drew mine up upon the Bank - one of which was upon the Ground , and the other up in the Air ; and then the Women fell out before his Wheel ; I had hold of my Horse all that Time - the Women slid out at the Back-Side of the Cart , and so fell before his Wheel - not above a Yard before the Wheel . Court . I ask you , whether or no he ever stopp 'd at all ? Cook . He never stopped at all ; - his Cart went over my Wheel , and so over the Women . Q . When you saw the Wheel so close to your Cart , did you say any thing to him ? Cook . I called to him , but there was not Time for an Answer . - I saw the Wheel go over that young Lady , Mrs Horabin , and I thought she could not have lived ; I turned her Coats on one Side , and the fleshy Part of her Leg was tore in such a manner that it was surprizing . Court . Do you think that after the Women were upon the Ground he could have stopped his Cart ? Cook . I do not think he could , time enough to prevent the Mischief - my Wife died of the Wounds , to my very great Loss : The prosecuting of this Man will be no Recompence to me , but I think I ought to do it in Justice to my Country ; as soon as my Wife was dead , I went to enquire after the Prisoner , and he was gone off ; the Monday after my Wife was buried , I offered five Guineas to have him taken , and desired a Person to take my Horse , and if he rode 20 Miles that he should endeavour to find out the Prisoner ; we could not then hear of him , but the first Time I heard of him at his Master 's I had him taken up . Mrs Horrabin confirmed Mr Cook 's Evidence , and said , that the Cart run over her Thigh and her Arm , and broke her Thigh , and that there was Room enough on the other Side of the Road for the Prisoner to have pulled off . - I was in a covered Cart , but not so covered but that I could see through the Hoops . Mrs Hildersly gave an Account very consistent with Mr Cook 's , and that he called to the Prisoner a dozen Yards before he came up with them , that he looked into their Cart , as he was going by , drove on , and said nothing ; but can not be positive whether his Wheel was out of the Track , she being so frightened , that she could not tell whether she fell cut of the Cart , or not , nor how she escaped sowell Joseph Hawkins . I know that part of the Road is fifteen Foot and an half wide , and that the Prisoner might very easily , and without any Danger , have gone on the other Side ; and that the Ruts were not above four Inches deep . Ralph Sheppard . I drove one of the Carts that were on the Road at that Time , and where Mr Cook drew out of the Cart-Ruts , there was Room for two or three Carts to pass there , without any Danger ; and after he got off , he led his Horse two or three Pole , and drew his near Wheel upon the Bank , the Value of two Foot ; which occasioned the off Wheel to lean towards the Wheel of the Chalk Cart , and by that Means the Top of the two Wheels rubbed against one another - the Women fell down behind the loaded Cart of Mr Jefferies 's - I was four or five pole behind the Cart . Q . Was there no part of the Wheel of Mr Jefferies 's Cart that run over these People ? Sheppard . No , they fell behind the Wheel . Q . Were any of the Women hurt ? Sheppard . Yes , they were hurt - by the Fall of the Cart - by the Wheel of their own Cart . Coun . Did not you say , if they gave the Women a good Spank on the Arse , they might get up , and go well enough ? Sheppard . No , I did not say so - the Prisoner could not get out of the Track without over-turning his Cart . William Braint . I was mowing at the Time this Accident happened ; the first Thing I heard , was the Voice of Women , who said , they were all killed ; I saw Emyns 's Team of Horses run ; and I saw him lay hold of the Thill Horse ; and the Cart had then gone over the poor Woman 's Legs ; the Wheel was never out of the Rut - Mr Cook 's Cart was down before I saw it ; I got over the Hedge , and said , Lord have Mercy upon me , what are you at ; I said , Master Cook , how came this Accident , and , he said , he could not tell - the loaded Cart was above Cook 's Cart , when I saw it ; ( that is , past Cook 's Cart , one Woman was lying in the Rut ; and the that had her Thigh broke was lying athwart the Rut . Jury . Do you think it was possible for the Boy to stop the Horses at that Time ? Braint . There was no Possibility of stopping them , for the Womens crying out frightened the Horses , and they run . Q . Could not you , if you had seen Cook 's Cart there , have turned out of the Rut ? Braint . No , I could not , the Rut was a Yard deep . Guilty , Manslaughter . [ Branding .

Elizabeth Favel . On the 27th of July , I had been at Pancras-Wells to drink the Waters , and coming Home between eight and nine in the Morning , I met the Prisoner in the Farthing-Pye Field ; two Women passed me ; and as they passed me , one of them said , Why do n't you cut your Coat shorter , and went forward ; I turned about , and saw the Prisoner behind me ; she came on the right Side of me , pushed me , and asked me if I did not come along that Field ( a Field by Tottenham Court ) I told her , no ; she said , you lie , you did , for you have get my Apron off my Sides ; I told her , I had not ; for I never saw her before in my Life ; said she , Madam , do n't deny it , for I have the Strings in my Pocket ; and she pulled two Bits of Strings out of her Pocket ; she said , you and a Fellow were drinking a Pot of Beer at the Sun , and if I would tell her who I gave the Apron to , she would let me go on , else she would have either my Apron or my Cloak ; so she took hold of my Cloak , and pulled it ; I said , Pray do n't pull it , you will strangle me ; said she , Oh , d - n you , so I will . I screamed , and called out Murder ; but she took the Cloak , and ran away with it ; I saw this Soldier at the End of the Field , and told him that I had been robbed of my Cloak ; he went with me to the Edge of the Bank , and Philip Holder brought the Prisoner to me ; she had the Cloak on then , she had pinned it on ; she told him that I had stole her Apron from her , and he bid her give me the Cloak , and told her I did not look like a Person that would steal her Apron : She unpinned the Cloak and gave it to him , and he gave it to me , so I went home and she followed me home ; as soon as I came into the House , I fell into a Fit , and was not able to speak for some Time ; the Soldier and Holder came Home with me . - She was without her Apron when she came up to me . Prisoner . I had been at the Sign of the Sun at Tottenham Court to see for my Brother , and having my Apron cut off , I was in such a Fright that I could not tell whether she had a Cloak on or no . John Warren . I saw the Prisoner skuffling with this young Woman , and saw her take the Cloak off her Back , and put it upon her own , and run away with it , and ran down a Gravel-Pit . Holder took her , and brought her up the Bank . I asked her how she could take the Gentlewoman 's Cloak from her ; she said as Mrs Favel has related , and infilled upon keeping the Cloak . I desired her to return it , and go home with her to her Father and Mother ; said Mrs Favel , If you say I have stole your Apron , I will give you this which I have about my Middle ; but she said , No , that Apron is not so good as mine , mine was a Holland Apron . Philip Holder says , that he saw her take the the Cloak , and gave just the same Account with the last Witness . Jury . Was she sober then ? Holder . No , I believe not , I think she was in Liquor . Methusalah Favel . On the 27th of July , as I was at Breakfast , I heard a hideous Cry at the Stairs-head , I knew it to be my Child 's Voice , and she fell into a Fit ; I saw the Prisoner standing there , said I to her , Hussy , what do you do there ; she said , the Girl , or some such Expression , had got her Apron ; said I , Do you think we look like Folks that would take an Apron from any Body , he gone about your Business , or I must send you to the House of Correction . - She made regular Answers , I can not tell whether she was in Liquor or not .

George Morgan . On the 17th of July , I had been in Great-Russel-street , with some old Acquaintance , that I had not seen for several Years ; and coming Home to my Lodging , on Ludgate Hill , about four o'Clock in the Morning , I met with a Woman in differently dressed , and very clean ; I said , Good Morrow , Madam , you have been very late out , as well as I ; said she , I have been to see a sick Person ; and this is such a rude Place , that I am afraid of being out ; I said , do n't be afraid , Madam , I will be your Convoy , you shall come to no harm , I will see you Home ; I took her by the Hand , and handed her along , as if she had been a Lady of a Thousand a Year ; thinking she was a modest Woman , but I found to the contrary ; she took me to a House ( I think ) in Hanging-Sword-Alley in Fleet-street ; when I entered the House , I thought it looked a little fearful ; as being a Traveller , I have seen a great deal ; however , I ventured into the House , and went up two Pair of Stairs with her ; when I got there , I thought the Place looked a little dmal , not agreeable to my Person , as I thought but I was good humoured , and so staid ; I found two Women there , besides the Person I went to with - they were up ; she that I went in with asked me to drink a Dram ; I told her , as I came from a Dram Country , I would not drink any , they might drink what they pleased , and I would pay for it ; the Prisoner came to me ( I hope the Ladies will excuse me ) and opened the Buttons of my Breeches - I am sure it was the Prisoner - it was the first Time that ever I saw her - she sat upon a Chair over-against me , and gave me all the Encouragement she could ; but putting her Hand into my Pocket , I interrupted her , and bid her not use me so ; said I , Be honest , and I will be generous : I can not say , but I might have gone to Bed to this Woman , if they had used me well - not to the Prisoner , to the Woman that conducted me to the House ; she undressed herself , and went into Bed ; then I had almost undressed myself , and I went into Bed , and put my Breeches under my Head ; the Prisoner at the Bar ( Mary Stansbury ) attempted to take my Breeches from under my Head ; I saw her , and took hold of her Arm ; I told her once over again , Do n't use me in this Manner , if you intend I should stay in your House , and , I will be generous enough to you , but that would not do , she made a second Attempt - I believe I lay in Bed about a Quarter of a Minute ; for the Creature , who went into the House with me , got out of Bed , slipped on her Cloaths , and went down Stairs ; I immediately got up , when I saw what a House I was got into ; that it was more for Robbery than Pleasure ; I saw a Man come , and whisper to the Women through a Creek , which made me very uneasy ; I can not say it was Mr Stansbury ; they were then all three at the Head of the Stairs - there were but three Women in all - when I heard the Man whisper I put on my Cloaths , and was for coming away ; but , in the Middle of the Room , as I was coming to the Stairs , the three Women seized my Body ; one of the Women got hold of one Arm , and another of the other , while the Prisoner put her Hand into my Fob , and took my Money , five Moiodores , half a Guinea , and three Shillings in Silver ; with that I got hold of my Cane - I had no Sword , and it was much better I had not ; they struggled a good while before they got away from me ; and when they found I should be too hard for them ( for I had made three or four Blows at them ) one of them cried out , other Jemmy or William , he will murder us all ; when I came down Stairs , I met with this Man , that they called Jemmy or William , with a Club in his Hand , either a Broom-stick or a Mop-stick - I can not say it was the Prisoner ; I know it was a Man with a Scarlet Pair of Breeches on , as he had , when I saw him at the Door afterwards - it was between light and dark ; it was so light that I could know People very well . Court . Why the Sun was up then ? Morgan . My Lord , it was not far from being up . Court . July 17. the Sun rises at half an Hour after four ; you said , at first , it was about four when you came from Great Russel-street ? Morgan . I can not be positive to a Minute ; the Man made two or three Blows at me with a Mop-stick , which I received upon my Knees , the Cure of which cost me six Guineas ; however , I overcame him with my Cane , and he got into a Shed , and then I got into the Lane or Street , or what you please to call it ; when I was out of the House , y shut the Door ; and I stood at the Door , and It does not any Thing Door , for I will not go I have Satisfaction ; if I lose my Things I can not help it , but I will have Satisfaction ; the Prisoner then threw me my Shoe-Buckles and Knee-Buckles , and flung my Hat and Wig over the Fence to me , and bid me be gone , like a Scoundrel Dog , as I was ; I made answer , and told them , I would not go ; I took a Piece of Chalk , and wrote my Name upon the Door , and said , I would have Satisfaction , before I went from that Place ; and , I believe , I walked about an Hour , before I could see any Body to send for a Constable ; Mr Sharrock , at the Three Pidgcons in Fleet street , came to my Assistance ; I told him , I had been robbed in that House , and desired he would see me satisfied , in some Shape or other ; while I was talking to the Constable ; the Prisoner , he came to the Door . and asked what Business I had to walk there ; I told him , I had been robbed in the House ; he made me this Reply , that he was Master of that House ; I said to him , Sir , If you are Master of the House , I desire you would order your Door to be opened , for if you are an honest Man , you will not suffer any dishonest Thing to be done in your House ; he said , he knew nothing of it ; he had been Abroad all the Night : The Constable heard the Door open , and we went in ; said I , Sir , Do n't be afraid , I will go in first ; we went into every Room of the House ; and Mr Sharrock said , I believe Mr Morgan we shall find the Money , and we found it under the Bolster ; exactly the Money that I lost - there were no People to be found in the House , but an old Woman , and a little Infant about twelve Months old ; then I told the Prisoner , Sir , You very much like the Man that used me ; so I charged the Constable with him ; carried him to the Bell in Bell-Savage Yard , and from thence to the Counter - I can not swear he is the Man ; I believe he changed his Apparel , and came round about some way or other : he that abused me , was a tall Man . pitted with the Small-Pox [ a Description suitable to the Prisoner . ] Prisoner . How came you to go up two Pair of Stairs into a strange House , with a Woman you never saw before . Morgan . I thought there might be as much honestly up two Pair of Stairs , as up one Pair ; if a Man does love a Girl it can not be helped , but if he does he is not to be murdered and robbed . Prisoner . Did not you say that Mr Drinkwater and Mr Sharrock persuaded you to this Prosecution ? Morgan . No , I told Drinkwater I heard he was a very great Villain , and I said if he came to me again , I would horse-whip him : tho ' he was just to me in this , but he betrayed the poor Woman for the Sake of half a Guinea , and so I found her out . James Stansbury . Did not you offer to let me go , if I would give you one Guinea more ? Morgan . No , I never said so , for I would not do it for an hundred Guineas ; my Character is better known . I would not have my Character lost for any Sum . James Stansbury . Did you lay your Breeches under your Head when you were in Bed ? Morgan . I did not lie down in the Bed , I laid my Breeches under my Head , but they had but little Time to rest there for the Prisoner would not let them alone long - Sharrock . On Sunday Morning the 17th of July , I was called up between five and six , and they said there was a Robbery committed at Stansbury 's ( the Blood-Bowl House ) . When I came there Mr Morgan was at the Door , and said , he had been robbed in the House , and that he would not leave the Door till he had Satisfaction ; presently I saw Mr Stansbury standing there , said I to Mr Morgan , Do you think you should know the Man if you saw him ; he turned about , and saw Stansbury , and said , I believe that is the Man , and he charged me with him . I desired Mr Stansbury to give Leave for somebody to get over the Pales into the House ; he denied it , and said he had been out all Night , and he would not give Leave . After I had waited there about a Quarter of an Hour , the Door was opened , - a Girl opened the Door , and then we went up Stairs , and the Girl said , May be , Mr Sharrock , you may find the Money upon the Bed in such a Room , for the Captain was there ; I said to Mr Morgan , You will have your Money again , for I have seen this Trick several Times , and there the Money lay under the Bed not as if it had sell out of any body 's Pocket , but in a regular Order ; there were five Moidores , Half a Guinea , and three Shillings . Then I took Stansbury to the Bell , in Bell-Savage-Yard , and told him what Money was lost . The Captain had then made a Mistake of a Guinea . he thought he had lost a Guinea more , and Stansbury said , He would leave his Watch , and make him any Satisfaction if he would let him go ; I told him as I had got him , and several Robberies had been committed in his House , I would not let him go , without being discharged by a Magistrate . Prisoner . How came you to know of the Blood-Bowl . Sharrock . Because I saw it in the News-papers . Prisoner . Was it not Drinkwater 's putting in ? Sharrock . I have heard so , - I have heard him say so . Mary Stansbury . Have not I let you go all over the House , to see if there were any Trap-doors as it was represented ? Sharrock . I have looked over the House , and there is not any Trap Door , but there 's a Way to get out into the Neighbours Yard , and so from one to another , over little low Walls . Joseph Hawker . I live in Hanging-Sword-Court . On Sunday the 17th of July , about a Quarter after four in the Morning , I saw James Stansbury , his Wife , and two other Women , had been driving a Gentleman out of the House , and saw the Gentleman without Hat or Wig . I saw James Stansbury with a Broom stick in his Hand in the Yard ; I saw some Sticks wavering , but I could not see how they fell . Mrs Stansbury called to the Gentleman by the Name of a black guard Son of a B - ch , or some such Name , to come and fetch his Buckles , and she stood with a Mop in her Hand , as if she would have jobbed it into his Face ; then I say her put the Buckles down upon the Bench , and saw her go into the House , and afterwards saw his Hat thrown to him . I went down to the Gentleman , and he told me had been robbed ; I told him he could expect no better in such a House as that . William Panton confirmed the former Evidence , and says that he heard the Prisoner Mary , and another Woman , cursing and damning the Gentleman ; that the Prisoner Mary , asked who was afraid of him , and said that he had not acted a generous Part , that he had not paid for his Lodging , nor given the Maid a Shilling . This Witness was asked what Trade James Stansbury was to which Stansbury replied , I am a Clock-maker . Simon Plumpton . On the 17th of July about 4 o'Clock in the Morning , I saw a Gentleman come out of Stansbury 's House , and a Woman followed him , and the Gentleman gave her two or three Blows ; and a Man followed the Gentleman with a Mop-stick , and made several Strokes at him , but he guarded them off with his Cane very well . Court . Where were the Blows given you , Mr Morgan , in the House ? Morgan . No , in the Yard , my Lord . Plumpton . When she saw Mr Morgan set him pretty hard , she said , D - n him , he will be too hard for us ; take the Pistol and shoot the Dog . Morgan . I heard the same Expression , but I had forgot it . Edward Jones . I saw Stansbury 's Wife throw the Buckles , and sling the Hat and Wig over the Pales ; and about half an Hour after I saw James Stansbury come up Fleet street , about one hundred Yards from the Place . Ann Buckley says , she looked out of her Window , July 17 , and saw Mr Morgan , without Hat , Shoes , or Wig and heard the Woman Prisoner say , You Villain , do n't say I have robbed you , here 's your Buckles ; but does not know whether she gave them into his Hand , or tossed them ; and that she threw his Hat and Wig to him ; that she heard her say , knock him on the Head with a Broom-stick , but did not see the Man Prisoner . Ann Philips . The Prisoner , Mary Stansbury , brought the Buckles to the Prosecutor , and said , Here , you Son of a B - h , do n't say I have robbed you , and threw his Hat and Wig to him . Prisoner Defence . John Ray . The 16th of July about half an Hour after 12 , I went to the George by the Fleet-Market . and saw James Stansbury , and I am sure he was not out of the House till four o'Clock the next Morning . I am a Joiner , and live in Blue-Court , on Saffron-Hill . Mary Studock . I am the Prisoner 's own Sister , I was in Labour the 16th of July , and sent for her ; she was with me from between six and seven in the Evening , till 11 o'Clock the next Day , and then she was sent for , because her Husband was taken up . My Husband is a Taylor , and lives the Backside of St Clements . Hannah Smith . The Prisoner went to Mary Studock 's , on Saturday the 16th of July , between six and seven in the Evening , I staid till between nine and ten , and left her there . Morgan . This very Woman came drunk to my Lodging , and said she would swear any Thing before I should hurt her Sister . John Studock says , he went home on Saturday Night between 11 and 12 , and the Prisoner Mary was with his Wife , and staid till 12 o'Clock , on Sunday Noon , and that there was no body there but his Wife , the Prisoner , and himself . Q . Was not Hannah Smith there ? Studcock . Yes , she was backward and forward . Juliana Stansbury . I am the young Man 's Mother , and I do say , that at the Time this Robbery is sworn against them , one was at a Publick-House , and the other was with her Sister . I lived with them at that Time ; he went out about five in the Afternoon , and she about seven , and I did not see her again till 11 o'Clock the next Day . Hester Grant . My Mistress was sent for to her Sister , the 16th of July between six and seven , and did not return till I went for her the next Day , between 11 and 12 . Morgan . The old Gentlewoman begged and prayed me to be favourable to the Prisoners , and owned that they were both in the House . Jer . Button . I went to enquire for James Stansbury , the 16th of July , between 11 and 12 at Night , and the Maid said they had been both out all the Evening . Elizabeth Jones and John Laven had known James Stansbury , one twenty-five Years , and the other twenty three Years , and that he always behaved well and bore a good Character .

July 23 . Thomas Gray . I was Turnwheel to Mr King , Pewterer in Gracechurch-street , when this Fact was committed , the Prisoner and Marmaduke Prothero , were his Apprentices . - I saw Marmaduke beat out two Pieces of Lead flat and smooth with a Hammer upon an Anvil ( Cotes was by at the same Time ) he nail 'd one of them to a Piece of Board , and turned a round Hole in it , - he said it was to cast a Seal for a Watch ; he turned it to the Bigness of a Half-Crown and hollowed it , and then fixed a Half-Crown upon it . After he had done that Piece he nailed the other Piece on , then he hollowed it to the same Circumference , and half the Thickness ; so these two Pieces of Lead were one Mould ; after he had done that , he held the Hollow of each Piece over the Candle and blacked it with the Smoak ; then he put the two Pieces of Lead together , and put a Half-Crown between them , and laid it upon an Anvil ; ( he made the Impression before he smoaked it with the Candle ) and gave it a Stroke or two with a Sledge-Hammer , and then there was the Impression of a Half-Crown on each Side of the Mould ; then he took some of the Metal that my Master makes his best Pewter of , put it into a Ladle , melted it , and poured it into the Mould , and it came out in the Shape of an Half-Crown ; then he said to William Cotes , this will serve well enough to give to the Whores , if we have an Opportunity . Q . Did the Prisoner make him any Answer ? Gray . I do not remember , that he did ; Marmaduke , made three or four at that Time , and filed the Edges to make them smooth , I did not see the Mould again for a Fortnight ; when he destroyed that , and in the like Manner made a Mould for a 36 s. Piece ; he did not use that Mould , that I know of ; he had a Sort of Metal , what it was I can not tell , but to look at it , it was like a Piece of Glass , he put that into the Ladle , and held it till it was red hot , but it would not melt ; William Cotes then said , You can do nothing at that , Duke , I would have you let it alone , and do no more about it , he laid it by at that Time ; the next Day , or the Day after , he melts some Lead , and pours it into two Parcels as before . beats them out flat , and nails one of them to the Block , and makes a Hole in it , as he did before ; after he had made one , he bid William Cotes do the other ; William Cotes tried , but could not do it so well as he - he asked William Cotes to make the other half Mould ; Cotes said , Make an End of it yourself , for I will do no more about it ; Prothero made an End of it himself , and did it to his own Liking ; after it was done , and he had made the Impression , he held it over my Master 's Pit of Metal , to melt the Edges off , because he thought it was too broad - he held the Mould over that Mettle to melt the outside Edges off ; and doing that , he made it so hot , that it all run in , and he lost his Mould : William Cotes said , you have spoilt my Master 's Pot of Metal , and that he could not cast the Basons ; which made a great Confusion between them two at that Time ; and no more was then done : The Saturday following , my Master went to his Country-Seat at Camberwell ; in the Afternoon , Marmaduke came down into the Cellar , and made another Mould for Half-Crowns , as he did the first ; he made the Impression , and finished it by himself ; after he had done it , he melted down some of my Master 's Metal , and poured it into the Mould , and it came out in the Shape of a Half-Crown . Q . How many were there cast at that Time ? Gray . There were eight or ten cast . Q . Who cast them all , Marmaduke , or the Prisoner ? Gray . Sometimes one cast , and sometimes the other . Q . Are you sure that the Prisoner cast any ? Gray . I saw him cast some . Q . What do you mean by casting ? Gray . I mean the pouring the Metal into the Mould - sometimes they came out with Holes in them , and then they threw them into the Pot again . Q . Who threw them in again ? Gray . Cotes threw some in . Q . Can you tell , who cast them that were cast whole ? Gray . I can not tell whether Cotes cast any that came out whole . Q . Did William Cotes cast any that were cast perfect ? Gray . I can not say that he did , I would not say it for the World - After they were cast they filed the curside Edges off . Q . Did Marmaduke or Cotes do it ? Gray . I saw Cotes and Duke do that ; after that they left off at that Time , and on the Monday Morning , when I came to work , they seemed sorry for what they had done ; and said , they would do so no more ; the Wednesday after that , we were casting Plates and Easons again ; and William Cotes took the two Moulds , that which was for the 36 s. Pieces , and that which cast the Half-Crowns , and melted them down in my Master 's Iron Ladle , and threw them under my Master 's Pit ; and said , that there never should be any such thing done more while he staid ; - the Prisoner was taken up the next Day , - Duke was run away ; he went away on the Wednesday ; when Cotes melted the Moulds down , he had some of the bad Pieces by him , that they had made , and he put them into the Pit , and melted them . Q . What made Duke run away ? Gray . I believe it was upon the Account of something that Mr Stevens had heard , and he charged him with it , and he run away . Q . Do you know what they did with these eight or ten that they cast ? Gray . I heard them say , they had put some off with Whores - I heard them both say so .
