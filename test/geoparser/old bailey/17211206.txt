One Night it happen 'd ( as each was relating to the other his Misfortunes ) that the Farrier told him he had got a most wicked Wife at London , who was about to sell all his Goods , and run away with the Money ; and at the conclusion of the Story , told the prisoner , if he 'd go to his ( the Farrier 's Father ) in London , in order to prevent his Goods being sold , he 'd hire him a Horse , and bear his Charges . This Request , the prisoner ( in gratitude ) knew not how to refuse . The Farrier then brought him the aforesaid Mare on which he rid to London , and put up in Sboreditch , because it was most out of the way of his Creditors . - But the Farrier not appearing , the Jury found him Guilty .

Upon which taxing Sarah Herbert , she confest it ; and said , if they would not prosecute her , she 'd return the rest . William Wilkinson depos 'd , that Sarah Herbert offer 'd to sell a piece of the Tankard to him , telling him her Husband found it on the Lay-stall . The pieces of the Tankard were produc 'd in Court , and Sarah Herbert 's Confession read . She took the Fact wholly upon herself , and said , that Tho Harper knew nothing of its being taken ; but added , she was Drunk , and knew not what she did . Harper was Acquitted , and she was found Guilty . Death . James Wright , of St. James 's Westminster , was indicted for asaulting Samuel Towers on the Highway , putting him in fear , and taking from him a Watch , value 5 l. and 10 s. in Money , on the 22d of January , in the 6th Year of the King . Samuel Towers depos 'd , that on January the 22d , 1719. being in a Hackny Coach , in Marlboro street , three Men disguis 'd , on Horseback , stop 'd the Coach , and one of them presenting a Pistol to his Breast , demanded his Money , but not delivering readily , another , at the other Door , cry 'd out , D - n him , does be resist ? shoot him ; and with that , struck the Prosecutor on the race with a Whip ; they then took away his Watch and Money , and afterwards rob 'd the Ladies in the same Coach , and rid off . William Hawkins depos 'd , that he , his Brother , and the prisoner , committed that Robbery . That he ( this Evidence ) pawn 'd the Watch in Hounsditch for 40 s. and the prisoner had his share of the Money . Mr. Norris depos 'd , that the prisoner and Hawkins hir 'd their Horses together of him ; and Arthur Turner depos 'd , that they both put up their Horses in his Stables .

T. Askew depos 'd , that when the prisoner was taken ( upon Hawkins 's Information ) he heard the prisoner say , That Rogue Hawkins ! - I expect no other than to be ty 'd up . The prisoner in his Defence said , that Hawkins would swear any thing to save his own Life . That Hawkins had often enticed him to go on the Road with him ; but he refusing , Hawkins told him one Day , If you wont go with me , I 'll be up with you . Guilty . Death . Christopher Samuel Graff , of St. Andrews Holborn , was indicted for a Rape , committed in and upon the Body of Sarah Pearse , Aged about 12 Years , on the 11th of September last . The Council for the King opened , that Sarah Pearse lived a Servant with Mrs. Loo , who was a Lodger in the Prisoners House . That the Prisoner the better to accomplish his design , enticed Sarah Pearse , with offering ber more Wages , to leave Mrs. Loe and live with him , which the Child did ; that then taking an opportunity when all the Family was out , but himself and the Child , he committed the Fact for which he then stood at the Bar ; and then to stop the Prosecution , Arrested the Childs Mother in an Action of Scandal for 40 l. Sarah Pearse deposed , that about 3 in the afternoon , ( no body being at home but the Prisoner and her self , ) the Prisoner called her up Stairs , and when she came to him he pulled her into the Parlor , where she saw his Night Gown lying on the Floor , at which being frightned , ( as not knowing what he intended to do with her ) she cry 'd out , and held by the Door , but he loosed her Hands , and told her it would signifie nothing to cry out for no body could hear her , and then tying a Napkin about her Head to prevent her making a Noise , he laid her upon the Floor , laid himself upon her , and thrust something up her Body , which she thought would tear her to pieces , and made her bleed so much , that when he took her up again and carried her into the Kitchen , she blooded all the Stairs as she went down . That he lighted a Fire himself , and made her pull her Cloaths off . and then he got Towels to wipe the Blood from her , and afterwards put some Flower into a couple of Napkins , and tied them fast round her Waste with a Handkerchief , which was produced in Court . The Prisoner then got a Bowl of Water and a Cloth , and washt all the Stairs down where they were Bloody ; that he came to her again , and she being very cold after such a great Effusion of Blood , he told her she must go to Bed . and then she 'd be better , he then wash 'd her Shift and hung it to dry , and took her up to Bed ; but she bleeding still , he tore the Sheet and wrapt about her , and covered her up close to make her sweat : a little while after he brought her some Powder , which he gave her in a glass of Water , which made her both purge and vomit so much , that she fill 'd the Chamber Pot 3 or 4 times , which the Prisoner carried down and emptied . That afterwards he gave her two pence , bid her be a good Girl and not tell any body , and if his Wife dy 'd in Childbed he 'd marry her . Mrs. Loe deposed , that coming home in the Evening , she saw the Prisoner go up and down Stairs in great disorder and confusion , this was on the Monday : and after the Child told of it the Friday following , she the Child said that the Prisoner gave her 2 Pence , bid her say it was done on the Saturday before , when the Prisoner was not in Town . Sarah Page , the Childs Mother deposed , that being sent for by Mrs. Loe , the Saturday after the Fact was committed , she found the Child crying , and asking her what was the matter , she said her Master had ruined her , that she this Deponent then askt the Prisoner what he had done to her Child , but he made no Answer . She then got a Warrant from Justice Ellis , upon which the Prisoner arrested her in a 40 l. Action for Scandal . The Childs bloody Petticoat , and the Cloath that was put under her in the Bed , were produc 'd in Court . Humphry Cooper , Surgeon , deposed , that upon Examining the Child , he found the Vagina extended , torn and bruis 'd with a forcible entry . That she had been penetrated even to the inner Matrix , and that he was forc 'd to use the utmost Art , both by external and internal Medicines , to prevent a Mortification , and that the Child told him the Prisoner had forced her , but she was ashamed to speak of it . The Prisoner in his Defence , said that whilst the Child lived with Mrs. Loe , he has called her to him and said , Sarah let me feel you , I 'll give you a Penny , thinking she 'd run away , but she has stood quietly and let him , that then he said to her , Sarah , go and undress your self and come to me and I 'll give you 2 Pence , and the Child has done so , that he had lain with her several times , before that mentioned in the Indictment , on the Table , the Dresser , and the Floor , for a penny and two pence a time , and that she would naturally come to him to earn a penny after that Manner , and he could not be guilty of a Rape , when the Girl was always willing . That when his Wife next Dav suspecting something , by the disorder of the Room and Bed Cloaths , askt the Girl if any body had been rude with her , she said , no ; that when several others askt her the same Question , and tax 'd her with it closely she answered no . That the next Morning being Tuesday after the Fact , she the Child walk 'd with her Mistress as far as Shoreditch ; that on Wednesday , he sent her with some Pills to Mrs. Talbots , who ask 'd her how she liked her new Master , and the Girl said very well . This Mrs. Talbet Swore to in Court . That if any harm had been done to the Child , it would have shew 'd it self sooner . That the Childs Mother offer 'd to make it up with him for 5 Guineas , and that Mrs. Loe had quarrell 'd with his Wife , and threatned to hang him . Dr. Dearing depos 'd , that going , at the prisoner 's Request , to see what Damage was done the Child , the Mother refus 'd to let him , saying , that they had already employ 'd an able Surgeon , who was Master of his Business . This Deponent added , That it was next to impossible the wounded Parts of the Child should be in any danger of a Mortification ( as the former Surgeon depos 'd ) for a Mortification ca n't easily ensue after such an Effusion of Blood , and where the Parts are not expos 'd to the Air ; and had there been any thing like a Mortification , the friction of those external Parts would have fretted , and made them so sore , that the Child could not possibly have gone so far as Shoreditch . The prisoner brought several to swear , that they had heard the Child say , the prisoner had lain with her several times before , and giving her Money for so doing ; but at last he call 'd one to his Reputation , who depos 'd , that the prisoner was a Man of such extraordinary Modesty , that being at the Christning of this Deponent 's Child , he had not boldness enough to kiss the Gossips , but they were fore 'd to kiss him .
