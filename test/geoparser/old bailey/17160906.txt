The Indictment preferred to the Grand Jury for the Murder of the said Daniel Vaughan was returned Ignoramus John Bill depos 'd , That the Night before ( viz . the 23d of July last ) after he had shut up Shop , he went out for his Supper , and at his Return found several Watchmen at the Mug-house Door , which occasioned a great Mob , and he saw them throw Stones at the Windows , upon which two Gentlemen came out with their Swords drawn . Next Morning he saw the Windows broke very much , so that there was scarce 4 Panes whole ; but saw none of the Watch endeavour to prevent the Mischief . After this he saw the Prisoner and a Grenadier go from the Mug-house Door to the End of Salisbury-Court , but were drove back by the Mob . Then he heard the Proclamation read , upon which the People advanced with great Shouts for the space of 3 Minutes , and then the Prisoner fired , the Mob being within 20 Yards of the Prisoner 's House , the Deceas 'd about 10 Yards before them , and the Prisoner 5 from his House . That he could not remember any particular or general Cry used among the Mob , but believed the Deceased did not belong to them , and that he had no Stick in his Hand ; however he had heard he was a Mobber . Charles Tuckey depos 'd , That on the Day mentioned in the Indictment , he was in a Balcony over against the Mug-house , and about 1 a-Clock saw the Prisoner come out with a Blunderbuss in his Hand , and saw the Mob advancing from Fleet-street to the Mug-house Door hollowing , as the People did in the Mug-house ; and being ask 'd what their Cry was in the Mug-house , he answered , King George for ever . That some of the Mob had Sticks ; That then the Prisoner push 'd on 4 or 5 Yards from his own Door , and fired , and the Deceas 'd fell , much about the same Distance before the Mob . He saw no Stick in his Hand . That 2 or 3 Soldiers came out at the same time , and one of them fin 'd ; but he believed the Prisoner did the Execution . And Bill stood up again , and said , he thought the Blunderbuss did the Mischief . Katharine Bennet depos 'd , That she saw the Prisoner level his Piece at the Deceas 'd . That she kept Shop over against the Mug-house , and heard a great Noise in it the Monday Night before , insomuch that she sate up all Night ; and she heard some of the Gentlemen there say , Come , let 's go to the Swan ; which they did , and she heard them beat against the Windows ; and when they returned , she heard a Voice say , Come Gentlemen of the Roe-buck , let us drink the King 's Health . That about 1 a-Clock they went to the Swan again , and as they went she heard them say , Down with the Butchers , Down with the Barbers ( whose Door was beat open ) Down with the Pawnbrokers ; and that they beat against her Door , but could not break it open . She saw no Watch nor Constable then . The next Morning about 10 a Clock , she saw the Mug-house Windows broke ; there was no Stones thrown at them , till a Gentleman came out of the House , and several more with Sticks . That she saw a Mob in Fleet-street , but upon her Oath did not see them advance up the Court , but stood stock still , till after she saw the Prisoner kill the Deceas 'd . That the Prisoner was 3 or 4 Yards from his House when he fin 'd , and then she looked and saw the Deceas 'd fall . That the Prisoner levelled his Piece once before , but it would not go off . And that she saw no Stick in the Prisoner 's Hand when he dropt . Sarah Dawson depos 'd , That being a Servant at a Neighbour 's House to the Prisoner , she was sent about eleven a Clock of an Errand , but the Crowd being very great she turn 'd down a Passage into a fort of an Ally by St . Brides Church-yard Wall , and coming back again the same way , the Deceased stood at the End of the Passage ; and she push 'd him to get through , and the Piece went off at that time and the Deceased fell against her and frighted her . That there had been a great Disturbance all Night , that the Mug-house Windows were broke before this happen 'd ; and that she has been ever since under an uneasie Conscience , as fearing her self to have been in some measure the Cause of his Death . Joseph Harris depos 'd , That he was at work that Morning in Fetter-lane , where he heard there was a great Disturbance in Fleet street , upon which he went there to see what was the Matter , and saw the Deceased , whom he knew , and a great Crowd of People , and ask 'd him what was the Matter ; and the Deceased said , he did not know , that he would not be concern 'd , but would go to work , and that he had some Bread and Cheese in his Pocket . That he saw the Mug-house Windows broke ; but staid a very little while , and about a quarter of an Hour after he heard the Deceas 'd was kill 'd . John Holmes swore , He was going through the Court about 10 a Clock , and staid till half an Hour past eleven , in which time he observ 'd a great Crowd of Women and Children about the Mug-house Door , and a Constable and some Men come out of it , and read a Proclamation with three Huzzus ; and then saw the Prisoner bring out a Blunderbuss , which he discharg 'd and the Deceased fell , who was about four Yards from him , as he was from his House . This Evidence being ask 'd some Questions concerning a Mob , their Cry , and whether they had Sticks at that time ; answer 'd , Not as he saw , he heard nothing on it , he did not took towards Fleet-street . Thomas Moultfier depos 'd , That between ten and eleven a Clock on Monday Night he was going to Bed at a House overagainst the Prisoner 's , and saw no Stones thrown then ; but saw some Gentlemen in the Court , who went to the Swan , and beat against the Windows ; after which some of them said , Come , Gentlemen of the Roc-buck , walk in . Next Morning about six a Clock he saw a Crowd about the Swan , whole Windows were broke , as some were at the Mug-house , but did not know who broke them . That he saw a little Gentleman read a Proclamation , and a great Number of People were then at the end of the Court , many of them with Sticks ; and he saw them advance three or four Yards in the Court ; but some Persons came out of the Mug house and drove them back into Fleet-street , but at last were forc 'd to retire themselves ; and he believes it was half an Hour after the reading of the Proclamation before the Prisoner fired , when the Mob was about twenty Yards in the Court ; and he heard them cry , Down with the Mug-house . The Deceased was between the Prisoner and the Mob , and the Prisoner about a Yard and half from his House . He could not tell whether the Deceased came out of the Passage or no , tho ' he saw him before he was shot , nor whether he had a Stick . William Stratton depos 'd , he was going to Work about 11 a Clock , and saw a great Mob in Salisbury-Court , and going in the saw the Deceas 'd in the Swan , who call 'd him to drink with him , and then told him there was a great Mob ; but he was going to Work , and had some Bread and Cheese in his Pocket . By and by the Mob increased , and he heard the People at the Mug-house cry King George for ever , and the Mob High-Church and the King . But the Deceas 'd said he would not meddle . That he heard the Proclamation read ; That the Mug-house People drove down the Mob , but being forced back again , he and the Deceas 'd went out , and they parted at the Corner of the Passage , where he left the Prisoner . This was all the Evidence that appeared against the Prisoner to support the Indictment upon the Coroner 's Inquest on the Behalf of the King . Then the Prisoner called his Witnesses , who being sworn , deposed as follows . Mr. John Boyles depos 'd , That he was at the Mug-house the Night before , between 6 and 7 a Clock ; and about 9 a Constable and several Watchmen drew up in a Rank against the Door , which occasioned a great Mob ; and as Gentlemen came to the Mug-house , they hiss 'd them ; upon which he went to the Door to know why they hiss 'd , but they threw Stones at him , and at the Windows , which had been broke once before to the Value of 7 s. 6 d. That afterwards being in the Coffee-Room , a Stone hit him on the Leg , and then he went to the Constable , one overs , and asked him , if he was not ashamed to suffer such Things , having Authority and Watchmen enough to prevent it , by securing such Persons as threw the Stones ; who answered him , I was the People in the Mug-house that did it , and broke their own Windows ; that his Hour was not come , viz . 10 a Clock . After this Mrs. Read sent a Quart of Ale to the Watchmen to drink the King 's Health , but another Constable who was there then refus 'd it , and forbid his Watchmen to drink it . Then one Mr. Hucks offered them a Crown , saying , Come , these look like honest Watchmen , there 's a Crown for them to Drink ; which they took , but the Constable made them return that also . Then a Constable who was in the House read the Proclamation , upon which the other with his Watch came in , and demanded the Reason of that Rout , and was answered by the other Constable , There was no Rout but what was made by your Mob , and therefore they had just read the Proclamation to disperse them ; to which he replied , he was no Constable in that Ward , and therefore was not to direct him , and went away . A little while after some Mischief happened at the Swan Ale-house , and Mrs. Read beg 'd the Favour of some Gentlemen to stay in her House all Night , as he and some others did ; and about 6 a Clock the next Morning the Mob began togather , and continued till 9 , throwing Stones at the Windows , and seemed inclined to do more Mischief ; upon which the Deponent ventured out to them to reason with them , and to desire them to be easy and quiet , and not ruin a Man who had done them no harm ; in which Time he received two Knocks by Stones , one of which broke his Head and made him bleed very much , whereupon he ran into the House for a Stick , and drove them , but struck no body but the Person who hit him with the Stone . After this , being informed that an armed Mob was preparing to pull down the Mug-house , they sent two Expresses , one to the Lord Mayor , the other to the Lord Townsend ; and it was not long before a great Mob armed , with Sticks and Clubs , appeared in Fleetstrees making up the Court ; whereupon they consulted what had best to be done for the Security of the House ; and it was his Advice to attack them before they joined the Mob in the Court , and became too formidable ; and so they did , having a Blunderbuss which was brought to them about half and Hour before in a Coach : He and the Prisoner went out , and after they were repulsed , the Prisoner bid the Mob have a Care , stand off , near a quarter of an Hour before he fir 'd , which was done about a Yard and a half from his House , and then he went in to make a Barricade . Thomas Arrowsmith ( the Grenadier ) depos 'd , That he was at the Mug-house all Night ; and from 8 a-Clock , as Gentlemen came into it , they were assaulted by the Mob at the Door , who threw Stones at them . That a Constable was there with his Watch , but did not discharge the Duty of his Office , but encouraged the Mob by Connivance . Next Morning about 8 a-Clock , the Mob ( Men Women , and Children ) began to show their Colours , by crying out , High Church and Ormond for ever , and Down with the Mug-house . At last , about 11 a-Clock , their Number was very great , and he having his Arms , drove them from the Door 2 or 3 times into Fleet-street . Then the Proclamation was read , which served but to encrease their Rage and Number , who threw Stones so thick , that the Gentlemen were obliged to go into the House ; and then he with the Prisoner , who was also armed , went out and presented their Pieces , bidding them he gone , true a Care , stand off , & c.6 Minutes , during which Time they were pelted with Stones , so that they could take no Aim ; the Mob still advancing upon them , and hollowing out Down with the Mug-house , and then they both fired ; after which he posted himself for the Defence of the House , but in a little time some of them broke into it behind , and pushed him into the Court ; and then he was so beat with Sticks and Clubs , and dragg 'd along the Channel , that had it not been for the Guards and the Care of Mr. Tobias Cheesbrook , he had certainly been murdered ; and others at the same time were pulling the House to Pieces . That before this he saw no Harm offered to any body by the Gentlemen of the Mug-house . Mr. John Collins depos 'd , That he was at the Mug-house all Night for its Defence ; and the Society was informed , that a Gentleman was carried to the Swin , for crying out King George for ever ; upon which some of them went in a civil Manner to speak with the Constable , and know what he had secured him for , and knocked at the Swan Door , but they would not open the Door ; but some Persons up Stairs , opened the Windows and untiled the Penthouse , and threw the files upon the Gentlemen , which broke some of their Heads ; and thereupon they broke some of the Windows with the Tiles that had been thrown at them , but that no Windows were broke at the Swin , till after the Tiles were thrown from the Penthouse . Thomas Arrowsmith , the Grenadier , being then called again , deposed , that he was with them at the Swan , and received a Cut over the Nose by a piece of a Tile from the swan , tho ' no body had given them the least Provocation ; upon which some Gentlemen returned there Tiles , and broke their Windows . Then Mr. Collins returned to his Evidence , and swore , That next Morning the Mob broke their Windows ; and one of their Company went out , and took a Fellow whom the Mob called Vinegar , and brought him into the Mug-house , and about an Hour after he fell on his Knees , begged Pardon , and drank King George 's Health , and then they let him go . After which the Mob much encreased , and he heard them cry out , High Church and Ormond , No King George , No Hannoverians , Down with the Mug-house . But some Gentlemen went out , and drove them quite down to the Street ; but being repulsed , Mr. Read and the Grenadier went out again , and bid them stand off , keep back , & c. That the Deceased was at their Head , with a great Stick in his Hand , brandishing it and bauling out , Fall on , brave Boys , for the Duke of Ormond is landed with 20000 Men . And he verily believed he was the same Person they had released in the Morning , but was not sure ; a little after which the Prisoner fired . Then the Mob fell upon them , and some Gentlemen got away , but he and some others went up Stairs , and made a Barricade upon the Stairs ; after which they heard great clattering and breaking of the Goods below , which were thrown out , for their more speedy Destruction , to the Mob in the Court . Richard Newell depos 'd , That he was sent of an Errand into the Court between ten and eleven a Clock on Tuesday Morning ; he had heard of a great Disturbance there the Night before , and was willing therefore to see what would be the Consequence . Whilst he was observing things , he saw a great Mob come up the Court , and a Constable come out of the Mug-house and read a Proclamation ; and then the Gentlemen huzza 'd for King George , and he made a Huzza himself ; and the Mob huzza 'd , after which they advanc 'd to the House , and the Prisoner and some Gentlemen came out and sought the Mob , but were beat at last and forc 'd to return ; and then the Mob cried out , High Church and Ormond , No King George , No Hannoverians , Down with the Mug-house , louder than ever , with Sticks in their Hands . And being ask 'd whether many of them said so , he answer 'd , It was universal . Then he saw the Prisoner come to the Door , and lean there ; and the Deceas 'd with a Stick held up with his two Hands like a Quarter-staff , and he was making up to the Prisoner when he fell . That he saw some of the Mob-fling Sticks and Bricks at the House , whilst others advanc 'd with Sticks in their Hands . James Harbottle depos 'd , That as he was talking with a Friend that Tuesday Morning about eleven a Clock near the Rose-Inn at Holbourn bridge , about a dozen Men past by him with Sticks , hollowing ; and he followed them , and ask 'd what was the meaning of it ; and they said , they were going to attack the Mug-house ; upon which he trac 'd them , and at one Mr. Nicholls 's a Soap-boiler by Fleet-ditch , about half a dozen Sticks were deliver 'd to them ; from thence they went down Shoe-lane , and at a Braziers near Adams 's the Cook , they had more Sticks given them , and then they said , Come Boys , here 's Sticks enough now . That he went to give the People of the House an Account of it ; and the Mob having arm 'd themselves with Clubs to their Satisfaction , and thrown away their small Sticks , they went directly to Salisbury-court ; and after the Proclamation was read they press 'd forward , but were beat back by the Grenadier ; but growing stronger they return 'd to the Charge with a very great Shout . Then he went up to the Mug House and hear 'd the Prisoner say , Stand off , Have a Care , & c. and in a little time the Piece fired , the Mob at the same time throwing Sticks and Stones at the Prisoner and his House . Dr. John De la Caste deposed , that he went with three Gentlemen through the Mob into the Mug-house that Tuesday about eleven a Clock in the Forenoon , and they followed him almost to the Door . When he saw Mr. Read the Prisoner , he asked him what Provision was in the House for a Defence ; and finding none , he wrote a Letter to the Lord Townsend , to inform his Lordship of their Danger , and blamed the Prisoner for not doing so before ; and by and by he heard a small Gun go off , which he thought was a Warning-gun for the Mob to fall on ; for immediately after they did so with great Fury ; and he , being above Stairs with some other Gentlemen , they got out at a Window behind the House ; and the Sexton of the Church had the Cruelty to turn a Mastiss loose upon them ; but they drew their Swords and told him , they were on the Defence of their Lives , and if he did not call him off , they might be under a necessity of killing the Dog and him too ; upon which he called him off : and about a quarter or half an Hour after , he heard the Gun go off which he believ 'd kill 'd the Man . Michael Burrel deposed , That he was going home about 10 a Clock on the Monday-Night before this Action happened , and heard a Noise in Salisbury-Court , where he had been informed their was a Mug-house , but he had never been in ; and saw a Constable and some Watchmen there , who he thought incouraged and encreas 'd the Mob . by taking no Care to keep the Peace , or to prevent the ling Stones to the Windows , tho ' the Persons who threw there just by them , and all the Action done in their fight , and Stones were brought in Baskets and laid down by them . Being asked what Constable this was , he said some told him his Name was Johnson . That after the House had been battered some Time , the Gentlemen came down , and desired him as well as he could understand them ( being at some distance ) to do his Duty : but he went away , and left the Mob there . Next Day about Noon coming from his Chambers in the Temple , he saw a great Mob in the Court breaking the Goods of the Mug-house , and throwing them out at the Windows ; and as they were gutting and pulling Things down , he heard some of the Mob say , just thus will we pull King George from the Crown , which is none of his own . Then Dr. De ls Coste said he had something more that was material to offer , and standing up , depos 'd , That he heard too some of the Mob say , the Duke of Ormond , and some the Duke of Berwick , was landed with 20000 Men . That the Friday-Night before he was Chairman at the same Mug-house ; and he received Information , that the Mob threatned to pull it down that Night ; and fearing he should want Assistance , he sent a Messenger to the Loyal Society in Tavistock-street , desiring their Company and Assistance if Need should be , on that Occasion , who came very readily and disperst the Mob , so that no Mischief was done that Night ; but a few of them went by with a Harp and Fiddle , playing The King shall enjoy his own again . Then the Court told him , that since he said he had been Chairman of that Mug-house ; he would do well now he was upon his Oath to give an Account of their Orders and Behaviour . Upon which he told him , That about 8 a Clock at Night the President generally enters the Chair , and after profound Silence is made , they always begin a hearty Mug to the Health and Prosperity of His Most Sacred Majesty King GEORGE ; some time after that another to their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales and their Issue , and all the Royal Family ; a third to the Glorious and Immortal Memory of the late King William , and seldom or never miss a fourth to the Prosperity of the Church of England , sometimes with a supplement , as wishing she may never want Power nor Inclination to protect and encourage all Protectants , and sometimes without ; for the rest , if any are inclined to stay longer , they fill up the Time with other Loyal Healths of lesser Note , as the Chairman or President shall think proper ; but never to the Confusion or Damnation of any Person or Thing , as the Enemies to the Government and theirs have falsly given out . Mr. Carleton Smith depos 'd , That on the Tuesday aforesaid , my Lord Mayor sent him to the Mug-house in Salisbury-Court to see what was the Matter there ; and he found the court full of Mob , which made him go thro ' the Passage by St . Brides Wall to Mr. Read 's House , and he turning himself about saw two Parties engaging , and the Grenadier making a Longe at the Mob with his Bayonet fixed ; but at last they broke thro ' his Force , and made him and the Prisoner retire , bearing down upon them with a great Torrent , the Deceas 'd at their Head ; and at the very Instant that he was endeavouring to save himself thro ' the Passage , he heard a Piece go off , as the Deceas 'd ( to his thinking ) was advancing to the Grenadier to close in with him . He did not observe the Prisoner particularly ; but the Deceas 'd fell down just by him , starting and heaving one of his Legs , and died , after which he helped to convey him into St . Brides Passage , and immediately he heard a violent Noise of Boards breaking and crashing , which made him think it high Time to give an Account of it to my Lord Mayor . Mr. Paul Burdeau deposed , That he was in Salisbury-Court that Tuesday Morning , and saw a violent Mob affaulting the Mug-house ; and going into the Coach and Horses , an Alehouse over against Mr. Read 's , he saw 3 or 4 Constables ; at which he was surprized , there being so much need of their Assistance elsewhere ; and therefore told them he was asham 'd to see so many Constables in that House , when just by there was so great a Call for them to Duty ; and then they went out ; but he did not see them afterwards in the Court . About ten a Clock , as he walkt about in Fleet-street to observe what passed , he heard a Fellow say , Damn that Granadier , if it was not for him we would have a little Fun ; and the Deceased replied , Damn his Blood , I will have him down by and by ; upon which he asked some who knew him , who that Person was ; and they told him his Name was Daniel , the Captain of the Mob . After this he heard a Man was killed , and he went to St . Brides Wall , where he lay , and knew the Deceased to be the same Person . Mr. Luke Whitson deposed , That he was at Salisbury-Court about 12 a Clock , and heard a Consultation among the Mob to pull down the Mug-house , upon which he went to Mr. Read 's and told him of it , and then the Proclamation was read ; which served but to increase the Mob , who made great Shouts . He saw the Deceased knock down a Soldier , after which the Mob pressed forwards with the Deceased at their Head with a Club in his Hand , and thereupon he bid the Prisoner fire , saying , You have Law , you have Justice , you have Reason on your side , why do n't you fire ; and presently the Deceased sell , and dropt his Stick . He heard him cry , High Church and Ormond , and Down with the Mug house . Mr. Richard Bennet deposed , That he had been at the Mug-house the Monday Night before this Action , till past eleven a Clock , when the Mob was numerous , and the Stones thrown in great Plenty ; that one of the Company going out , was wounded with a Stone , and came back to be dre . Next Morning he was told by one of his Boys , that a great Mob was in Salisbury-Court , upon which he went to them , and heard them say they would pull down the Mug-house ; and getting up to it , he saw a Fellow bring out three Bottles in his Hand , kneel down by the Swan Door near the Channel , and drink the Pretender 's Health by the Name of James the Third , and hollowed , and the People in the Swan hollowed too . He also saw the Engagement between the Mob and the Grenadier , who was knockt down , and his Boy took some care of him , and helped him up . Mr. Edward Harding deposed , He saw the Deceased throw a Stone at two Soldiers , as big as his two Fists , about an Hour or two before , as they were going up to the Mug-house : He knew him very well , and some of the Mob called him Vinegar , some Little Daniel . After he was killed , he saw the Mob destroy all the Goods they could come at in the Mug-house ; and by and by a Fellow came out with three Bottles and drank the Pretender 's Health ; between twelve and one . But Mr. Bennet standing up again , deposed , that he thought it was before the Deceased was killed . And lastly , Mr. Badcock was sworn , who deposed , That having been informed on Monday Night by a Friend , that there was a Design to pull down the Mug-house ; he being a Constable , and being desired to keep the Peace , went to the House and found a great Mob at the Door throwing Stones ; and being asked whether there was any Riot or Disorder in the House , he said there was not . That a Constable ( whose Name he did not know ) and some Watchmen being before the Door , he desired the Constable and his Watch to keep the Peace ; who replied , they in the House occasioned the Breach of it themselves ; which was false , they having done nothing that could give a just Offence . That going up Stairs he heard a great Clatter against the Windows , and saw another Constable , one Johnston , whom he desired likewise to keep the Peace and disperse the Mob , promising to assist him , there being about 20 Watchmen with them ; but he replied as the other , that the Mug-house People threw the Stones themselves , tho ' he knew himself that that was impossible , ( the Window-Shutters being shut ; so that they could not fling any out . ) and that he had nothing to do there , not being a Constable of that Ward ; the Mob throwing Stones all the while in their very sight . He also heard this Constable say the House deserved to be pull 'd down ; and then one of the Watchmen took hold of him , and would have pulled him out of the House ; after which they came in , and made a Bustle and Disturbance in the House , so that he was obliged to read the Proclamation , the Mob throwing Stones at him all the while . The next Morning he went to see what Mischief was done , about 8 a Clock , and found the Windows broke , and a Gentleman wounded ; That one of the Mob threw a Stone at him , and as he was about securing him , the Mob knocked him down and resoned their Brother . The Prisoner had several Witnesses of Substance and Worth to speak to his Character and Reputation , but the Court thinking it needless , they were not examined . The Recorder having summ 'd up the whole Evidence , the Jury considered of it , and acquitted the Prisoner . John Love , Thomas Bean ( Servant to Cassie and Carnegy 2 of the condemn 'd Rebels now in Newgate ) George Purchase , Richard Price and William Price , of the Parish of St . Brides , were indicted upon the Statute of the first Year of the King , which makes it Felony without the Benefit of the Clergy , to demolish , or begin to demolish , any House , & c. Thomas Arrowsmith deposed , That he was positive to none of their Faces but Purchase 's ; and him he saw with a Stick in his Hand , walking to and fro about an Hour before the Mug-house Door , on Tuesday the 24th of July last . That about 7 a Clock that Morning , the Mob began to break the Windows with Stones and Bricks , crying , High Church and Ormond ; and a Woman cried , D - n all the Presbyterians ; but he took hold of her , and one Delander a Watchmaker rescued her from him . Mr. Samuel Gott deposed , That he saw the Prisoner Love helping to break down the Sign , and breaking the Goods and Windows , about 1 a Clock . That Purchase and Bean were also there hurling Stones , and breaking the Windows with Stones and Sticks , for about an Hour and half . Purchase said he had no Stick . Mr. Gott swore , he saw Purchase throw a Stick up at the House and Windows , and that Love was assisting in throwing a Rope over the Sign , by which Means they drew it first on one side , then on the other , till it was loosened and fell down ; and saw , him climb up the Rope almost to the very Sign . Bean said , he could prove to the contrary . Mr. Gott swore , he saw Bean break the Windows with Sticks thrown up against them . Mr. Michael Burrel deposed , he saw Richard Price go into the House , and fetch out the Goods and break them . That he laboured very hard , and was extraordinary industrious to make use of that Time to the Destruction of the House and Goods ; saw him in the Bar , pulling it down , and taking out the Papers , and employing himself every way to the said purpose . That he was at the Door when the Guards came , where he took the said Richard Price Prisoner . Mr. John Collins swore , that he saw two Prices , Purchase and Love , but did not observe Bean in the Rio , plendering and destroying the Mug house and Goods : That Love swarmed up the Rope almost as high as the Sign , is order to sway it down ; the Prices were employed chiefly within Doors in breaking the Bar and Household Goods , and Purchase in compleating the Ruine of those brought out , and breaking the Windows with Bottles and Sticks , bawling out all the while , High Church and Ormond . No Hannoverian , No King George , Down with the Mug-house . Love said he was coming by , and a Man push 'd him , upon which he took hold of the Rope to prevent his falling . But Mr. Collins standing up , was very positive that he climbed up the Rope , and that he saw several other Persons with Pickaxes , but could not say who they were . Mr. John Hasell junior swore , that he saw Bean running with great Joy from Fleet-street towards Ludgate-hill with part of the Sign of the said Mug-house , making a great Noise with a Mob that accompanied him ; that a Cart standing at a Patters Door hard by , Bean put it into the Cart and returned ; that there were the Letters R.R.E . upon the Sign , which made him take notice of it , and believes it by those Letters to be Mr. Read 's Sign : That this was about one a-Clock . He was very positive Bean was the Man ; for that he intended to have stopt him , in case he had come up so high as his House . Mr. Carleton Smith deposed , that he saw the Prisoner Bean , in his Return to my Lord Mayor 's from Salisbury-Court , with part of the Sign in his Hand , in a great Heat , running with it along in the greatest Joy and Triumph imaginable , towards Fleet-Disch ; which sarprized him , he being a Servant to Mr. Cassie and Mr. Carnegy , two Rebel Prisoners now condemned in Newgate . But that he could not take him then , because of the Mob . Next Morning he met him in Newgate-street , and took him up and confined him in Newgate . Mr. Luke Whitton deposed , That he saw William Price go in and out of the Mug-house several times , pull at the Sign with so much Force , that he thought the whole Front of the House was going to fall , beat the Soldier , and at last made off with the greatest Joy . Mr. Richard Graves deposed , he saw Love stamp on some of the Goods to break them , especially a Coffee-Pot . Mr. John Collins deposed , he heard them cry High Church and Ormond , No King George , No Hannoverian , Down with the Mug-house ; and was very positive that Purchase was one of them . Mr. Michael Burrel swore , he heard several of the Mob cry , Just as we pull down this Mug-house , we will pull King George from the Throne , which is none of his own . Purchase denied the Fact , and called 2 Witnesses to his Reputation , who did not appear ; and said , he never said any thing of that sort in his Life . Love denied the Fact too , but called no Witnesses : He said , he took hold of the Rope to save himself , as before . William Price said , he was not Guilty , and had no Friends in the World .

He was a second time indicted for an Assault on the Person of the said Richard Davis , and robbing him of 2 Coats , 1 Waistcoat , and 1 pair of Breeches , value 12 s. on the Day aforesaid . One Mrs. Taylor deposed , the Prisoner and the Deceas 'd lay together in the Stable , and on the 1 st of last February the Prisoner told her the Deceas 'd was gone to Esq ; Caser 's about selling a Horse , with which she was contented ; but hearing nothing of him in 2 or 3 Days , when she saw the Prisoner again , she ask 'd him , if he had heard any thing yet from Richard Davis ; But he answered , he had not seen him since , nor heard any thing of him . This very much surpriz 'd her and the Prisoner himself having been out of the Way 2 or 3 Days too since she spoke with him last , she did not know what to think of it ; but about a Fortnight after the Deceas 'd was found cover 'd with Dung headless . Another Evidence ( one Bisbop ) depos 'd That missing his Fellow-Servant , he asked the Prisoner what was become of him , who made him the same Answer as before ; upon which he ask 'd him what Cloaths he went in , and he said , in his own Cloaths , and had left his Livery in the Stables . That some time after this , being in the Field where there was a little Dunghill , the Prisoner , who was in the Yard , called to him , and asked him to drink , and fetcht a Pot of Beer , and afterwards another ; appearing to be pretty full of Money , and then asked him if he had turn 'd the Dung yet , and he told him No , it had not had time to rot . That next Morning he had Occasion to fetch a Wheelbarrow off the Dunghill , where he found a Human Skull , which struck him with Terror , and made him believe it was Richard Davis 's , but it was pickt clean to the very Bone , which he believ 'd might be done by the Hogs who were in the Field . With this Surprize he went to the Prisoner , and said , Lord have Mercy upon us , Richard , there 's Skull upon yonder 's Dunghill ; but he replied not a Word , and immediately went off . Then he went to a Neighbour 's and told him what he had found , who going with him to the Place found the Body also in the Livery , but no Buckles in the Shoes , where the Deceas 'd us 'd to wear Silver ones , not Money in his Pockets , tho ' it was well known he did not use to be without it . Two Women swore , the Prisoner brought them some Cloaths to pawn , and to sell for him , which proved to be the Deceased 's ; but it was remarkable , that the Prisoner had stript off the Silver Buttons which were upon some of them , before he brought them . One Mr. Smith confirmed much of this Evidence , and depos 'd , that the Prisoner was missing a great while after the skull was found , but at last was taken at Richmond , when he confessed the Fact . Upon Trial he seem 'd to be stung with the most sensible Remorse of his crying Guilt , not daring to look his Judge nor Jury in the Face ; but being often ask 'd what had mov 'd him to so great a Sin , he at last said , that the Deceased and he had quarrel 'd , upon which he kill 'd him ; but denied he cut off his Head . The Jury found him Guilty . [ Death .
