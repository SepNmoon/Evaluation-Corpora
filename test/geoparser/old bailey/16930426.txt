So it could not be presumed that he died of any such bruises ; besides there was a great deal of water found in his Body , which was long a contracting , and was rather the occasion of his death . The Prisoner was acquitted . Emme Woodhall was tried for a Trespass , in offering to put a false Guinea upon one Mr. Lawson ; but it was not fully proved upon her ; so she was acquitted .
