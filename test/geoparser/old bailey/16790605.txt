More exactly taken than ever heretofore . LONDON : Printed for L. C. 1679 . The true Narrative of all Proceedings at the Sessions for London and Middlesex , began on Thursday the fifth of , June , 1679 . ON Thursday morning first came on the Middlesex Jury , and began with Trying a man for a Burghlary and Robbery , committed on the House of a person of Honour at Chiswick , stealing two brass Kettles , and a hitch of Bacon out of an out-room , but part of the Mansion House , on the 24th of March last past , between one and two of the clock in the night . The door was lockt , but the Key hastily laid down and left on a Bench hard by ; which 't is to be presumed the Thieves observed , and therewith opened the door ; for in the morning the said Key was found orderly placed on the inside , but the door unlockt ; which unlawful taking the Key , and opening the door , though there was no violent breaking in , they declared to be a Burglary in Law : As for the Bacon , it was found upon search in the Prisoners house , and the Kettles appeared to be pawned by his Wife in London . He endeavoured to cast the Crime on a Souldier that is not to be found , and said that he brought the things to his House ; but not being able to prove any such thing , and endeavouring several times to run away and hide himself , when his house was search , & c. he was found guilty and received Sentence . A young fellow was next found guilty for picking a purse , and 4 l. 15 s. 6 d. out of an honest man s pocket , in the Exchequer Chamber in Westminster-hall , on the 18th of May . The Prosecutor having business in the Court , as he was coming out , the Prisoner , and two or three more , justled and crowded him very much , and as soon as rid of them missed his Money ; and seeing this fellow going to the stairs towards Hell , desired a friend ( being lame himself ) to follow him , who perceiving himself pursued , shly laid the Purse in a corner of a window ; the other seeing him take his hand thence , lookt and found it , turning back with joy to tell the party : but presently the Prisoner not having gone down above five steps , did likewise turn back , and then the now Prosecutor meeting him , cryed out , That was one that Robbed him ; so he was apprehended , and now found guilty , and sentenced . A bold Woman , and old offender , having lately received mercy , being in the very last general pardon , and since the last Sessions , Bayled out of Newgate , had presently fallen to her old ill courses , and stoln a parcel of Cloaths out of an House in Stepney Parish ; being descryed and pursued by the servants of the House , dropt the things , and two of her Companions got away ; but she was taken , found guilty , and being so irreclaimable as aforesaid , was Condemned to dye . A fellow for a very great quantity of Plate , pleaded guilty to that and all others within the benefit of Clergy , and so was content to take a mark in the Hand . A person at Westminster , on the 22 of May , had the ill-luck by flinging a small piece of a brick-bat at an old man , to kill him ; for which he was Arraigned for Murther : the case was thus : the Prisoner and two others came to drink at the deceased 's House , about Tuttle-fields ; as they were going away , a quarrel arose between them , and to fighting they went ; at which time the person killed coming home from work , and vext , as is supposed , that they should make a disturbance about his door , ran in and got a fork , with which he made at the Prisoner , and wounded him near the eye , who thereupon , having nothing in his hands , caught up a piece of brick-bat , and threw it at him , and there with knockt him down , and wounded him so , that he dyed the third day after of the same . They had never seen one another before , so that there could be no malice ; therefore he was only found guilty of Manslaughter , and received the penalty in that case usual . A mischievous Youth , watching his opportunity about ten of the Clock , one Saturday night , in March last , slipt into a Barber s shop , whilst the Master thereof was gone into another room backward , and stole thence a Cloak , and Case of Instruments , most of them tipt with silver ; but being seen go in by a Girl , that took special notice of him , having observed him lurking thereabouts for two or three hours , she gave such a description , that by the directions of a Thief-taker they found him out ; and being discoursed with concerning the Robbery , he at first declared he knew who had the goods , but on further consideration , thinking he had therein gone too far , would have recalled that acknowledgment ; alleadging , he knew the man only by sight , and not his name , or dwelling , or where to be found . However , the Girl being sent for , presently singled him out amongst half a score people , and now swore , how she saw him go into the shop , & c. whereupon he was Convicted and burnt in the Hand . Then the London Jury was called and sworn , and a Lad , late Apprentice to a Widdow in the Minories , keeping a Flax-shop , was Arraigned , for that he not having the fear of God before his eyes , but moved by the instigation of the Devil , did on the 15 of May last , about ten of the clock in the evening , set his said Mistress es House on fire . To the Indictment he ingenuously pleaded guilty ; and indeed , had he denyed it , there was sufficient evidence to have proved the Fact upon him . Then the Court took abundance of pains to perswade him to a true and candid Confession , by whose instigations and incitements he attempted so mischievous a Crime : which he pretended to do , and told a long story , how a Countryman of his met him , and carryed him to drink , and afterwards appointed to meet him at a Tavern in Holborne , where he gave him four shillings , and promised him Threescore pounds ( when the business was done ) to Fire his Mistresses House , and also a Box-makers over against it ; he likewise named a person of note , that had formerly dealt with his Mistress for Flax , and sometimes seemed to charge him as theparty that set him on , & c. But his present Account being neither very consistent with it self , nor agreeable to his former examinations , gave reason to suspect he had been tampered with , and did not fully discover the real truths ; so that after much patience and pains , the Court ordered him for the then present , to a farther Examination more private , thereby if possible to fist out the bottom of the business . Two notable Villains were then tryed for breaking a Gentleman s House near Fleet-bridge , on the third of June : about seven of the clock in the Evening they came in there to drink , would needs go up one pair of stairs , and after a little time , one of them got up two pair of stairs higher , and opening the door , and breaking open a box , got several Cloaths belonging to the servant Maid , who luckily going up in the nick of time , for a Blunder-buss , ( her Master being a Lieutenant in the Train-bands ) found him in the room , shutting the door against her ; whereupon , she running down , got help to secure them , and a bundle of Goods were found under the Table , where the other staid drinking , and the rest in the breeches of him that had been above , who refused to be searcht , till he came before a Justice : However , it not sufficiently appearing that the other was actually concerned , he was acquitted , and onely he that went up three pair of stairs , was Condemned . After dinner they proceeded with the Malefactors in Middlesex , and a young fellow was Convicted of Burglary and Felony , stealing away a parcel of Pewter and other things , on the 12th of May in the night ; for being immediately after the fact taken upon suspition by the Watch , with the things about him , he carryed them back to the place , and knockt up a woman at next door , and would have had her own them ; but she honestly dis-owning both him and them , the people robbed hearing the noise , inquired the matter , knew their goods , and so he was Committed , having been burnt in the hand before in Surrey , and but the very night before , escaped by reason of the late Fire , out of New-prison . And therefore since he would take no warning , justly had Sentence of death passed upon him . A Maid lately servant to a Midwife , was accused for stealing a pair of sheets , and a Silver Cup from her Misterss ; but it appearing that others had formerly been wrongfully accused for stealing the said Cup , and no direct proof against her , but several she had formerly dwelt with , justifying her : Truth and Reputation , she was acquitted . As likewise was a good woman about a Gown and Petticoat ; she proving , that as it was her profession to buy old Cloaths , so she honestly purchased these in Holborn , in presence of two witnesses . By the London Jury , two shop-lifts were that afternoon Convicted for stealing 20 yards of Persian Taffata , value 4 l. on the fifth of May , out of a Gentleman s shop on Snow-hill , being seen ( when they found themselves suspected and pursued ) to drop it in an Alley , near Holborn-bridge ; for which , being old Offenders , they were both Condemned . On Friday-morning two men were Arraigned on two several Indictments for stealing two Horses , one from Clapham , the other from Battersea ; the first of Nine , the last of Four pounds price . On the 26th of May last , in the night , these Horses were lost out of the Grounds where they were at Grass , and one of the Owner s missing his , spoke to an Acquaintance that was to go down to Banbury-Fair ( an eminent place for putting off Horses ) to take particular notice if he could see his Guelding , he knowing the same very well . Accordingly he going out of Town , before he to Acton overtook one of the Prisoner s on the said horse , in company with three others likewise mounted ; and observing horse , rode before to Acton , and there seized him and his , and the other Prisoner , one of the said Company , with whom was found the other man s horse that had been stoln the night before from Battersea , as afterwards appeared ; the two hindmost presently turn 'd off , and riding extream hard , got clear away ; on whom the now Prisoners would gladly have laid the whole Guilt : one alleadging , that he was only hired to ride a spare horse ; and the other , that he was going down to Alesbury , concerning which he told a long story of a pair of Boots , but bootless to him in this Case : For not being able to make any thing of that kind appear , they were both found guilty and Condemned . A kind of outlandish Fellow being in charity taken in at Linn by a Scotch Master of a Vessel , and his Passage given him to London , was so ill-natur 'd as to requite that kindness by stealing out of the Ship , as she lay at the Armitage-stairs , a considerable parcel of Worsted-stockings , which he was seen to carry off ; and being thereof convicted , prayed heartily for Transportation ; which , he being a Forreiner , was granted . A pretended Purser was tryed for stealing a silver Watch , a silk Petticoat , and other womens Cloaths , out of an Ale-house , where he and several of his Associates came to drink at St. Katherines , on the 27th of May ; but there being several others in company , and no direct proof , he was acquitted : As likewise were two men Indicted for stealing a considerable quantity of Copper and Brass ; but on opening the matter , it appeared , that the same was delivered into their custody by the prosecutor about Black wall , to carry to his House at Wapping ; and although instead thereof , they carry 'd it far beyond , and went to make Money of it , yet being so delivered them , it could be no Felony , but the party left onely to his Action for remedy . Much such a Case there was before this sessions , concerning Brass and Iron work , to a great value , intended for a Water-Engine , but by the Gentleman that own 'd it , put out to a workman to amend or correct it , yet still standing on ground that the Prosecutor paid rent for , from whence the said Workman and a Kinsman of his fraudulently removed it , and sold it in parcels to several people , and the said workman since absconds himself , but his Kinsman was now Indicted for the same ; however , it being left as in their possession , and publickly removed , as they alleadged , he got off . There were two Women Indicted for Robbing a Child of about nine years of age , of about nine pounds worth of unwrought Silk , which she was carrying home , and in More-fields a certain woman came up to her , and pretended to come from her Mother , to help her to carry it ; but the Child refusing to let her touch it , she went along with her into Petty-France , and there wheadled her to go of a feigned Errand for her into an Alley , where two other women seized her , and one held her by the middle , and the other stopt her mouth , whilst the first violently snatcht and ran away with her Silk and then they let her go ; who being frighted , did not observe which way they got away , but some days after , seeing the two women that to held her in the street , knew them again , and caused them to be apprehended , and now they were Indicted as aforesaid : but the Child being so young , the Court ( though she told her tale very notably ) did not think fit to administer an Oath to her ; and there being no other evidence , they were discharged . But this may warn all parents , not to send goods of value by Children so young , when there are so many mischievous people abroad , that lye in wait to rob and abuse them . A Gentleman having ( but ungenteely at the Devil-Tavern ) ran another into the belly , and quite through the body ; a very dangerous wound , upon scarce any provocation , and before the other so much as saw his sword , the same being drawn under the Table , he was now indicted for the Assault , and though he endeavour 'd in vain to have ballanc 'd it with bringing a Cross-Indictment ; yet being found guilty , he was fined 100 l. committed in Execution till the same paid , and to find Sureties for the good Behaviour for a Twelvemonth . There were in all Eleven Persons , Seven men and Four women , received Sentence of Death , viz . Two for Horse-stealing , in which they rid double , each being guilty of two Indictments ; One for Pocket-picking ; Three for Burglary and House-breaking ; Two women , notorious Shop-lifters ; and Two other women and a man ( having all formerly received Mercy ) for several Felonies . There were likewise Six Persons burnt in the hand , Two allowed to be Transported , and One ordered to be Whipt : And so the Sessions concluded .
