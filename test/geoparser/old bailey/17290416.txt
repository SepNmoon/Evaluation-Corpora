It was also added , that about 9 or 10 a-Clock that Forenoon , a Man came there , who he heard had been a Sweetheart of the Deceas 'd ; that he sat down , drank a Pint of Drink , and smoak 'd a Pipe ; that the Deceas 'd being washing some Rooms , came down Stairs , and sat down and drank with him , and trundled her Mop , and went up-Stairs again , and when she came down , she sat down a little while again , and he did believe the Man did kiss her , or whisper 'd with her , for they sat directly over-against the Bar ; that he saw an Alteration in the Prisoner 's Countenance , and that he look 'd ruffled ; but he knew nothing of any Courtship to have been between them . Mr. Saunders depos 'd , That he dining that Day at Mr . Pain 's House , the Prisoner drew him a Pint of Drink , and the Deceas 'd spoke for a Tankard to be carry 'd out of Doors ; that while the Prisoner was gone with it , two more came in , and the Deceas 'd went down and drew two Pints of Drink , one for the Men , and carried the other into the Box where she was at Dinner , and he saw no Knife in her Hand when she came up with the Drink ; that soon after the Prisoner came in , and went into the Box to the Deceas 'd , and in about 3 Minutes , or thereabouts , the Prisoner call 'd out , and said , Madam , pray come here , and see what is done ; that she went , calling Mr . Pain , saying there was Murder committed ; they went , and found the Deceas 'd and Prisoner in the Posture before related ; that Mr . Pain call 'd the Prisoner Villain , and said , He believ 'd that he had done it , and he should give an Account of it before he was clear 'd ; that the Prisoner said , He was as innocent as the Child at his Mistress 's Breast : His Master ask 'd him how it came ; he reply 'd , he could not tell ; but that when she went down to draw the 2 Pints of Drink , she carried a Knife into the Cellar ; that when he came into the Room , he saw her leaning upon the Table , and said , James , I am a dead Woman : That seeing a great deal of Blood upon the Ground , he ask 'd her how it came ? but she made him no Answer , but tumbled out of the Chair ; that thereupon a Candle was lighted , and Mr . Pain went down into the Cellar , and himself , some Stairs , but saw not a Drop of Blood ; and added that the Prisoner was gone out of the House when the Deceas 'd went down to draw the Drink , and they saw no Knife in her Hand . Mr. Cox , a Surgeon depos 'd , That about 2 a-Clock he was sent for , and coming immediately , found the Deceas 'd lying on her Back and a vast Effusion of Blood , but her Lips chang 'd when he came in , and searching , he found the Wound in the upper part of the Thigh , and it had open 'd the Femoral Artery , and looking on the Table , he found a Knife among the other Knives , which Knife had a little Blood upon it ; that he compar 'd the Knife with the Cuts in her Cloaths , and also the Wound , and it answer 'd exactly to all ; that it was a broad-pointed Knife , yet had gone through an Apron , a quilted Coat , a Stuff-petticoat , and a course strong Shift , so that it must go with a very great Force to do that , and also to penetrate as it did 5 Inches into the Thigh ; that the Wound went obliquely upwards , and , he thought , was scarce to be done by the Deceas 'd , in the Posture she was suppos 'd to be in ; that the Knife also lay about 4 Foot from where the Deceas 'd was sitting , as was said , and he was of Opinion , after the Wound given , she could hardly place it there ; that such a Wound in that Part was so immediately mortal , that a Person could not live above 2 or 3 Minutes ; that under her Chin , and under her Left Ear , and about her Elbows , there seem 'd to have been some confinement or Violence used , so as to cause the Blood to stagnate , and prevent its circulating .

Pain , depos 'd , That about six Weeks before , the Deceas 'd complain 'd of the Prisoner 's beating her , and that she could not bear it ; that she show 'd her her Head , and there was a great Bump upon it as big as an Egg , and she got some Rum and bath 'd it ; that the Prisoner had thrown a Candlestick at her , but it did not hit her : and that she had heard them quarrel several times ; that the Deceas 'd once said to the Prisoner , If you do me a Mischief , if I do not live to see it , I have those that will live to see you hang 'd . Mr. Baldwin depos 'd , That being at Mr . Pain 's about 9 a-Clock , and some Discourse passing among them , the Prisoner said of the Deceas d , She knows what 's what ; to which , as she was going up Stairs , she reply 'd , I never had a Bastard ; that soon after she came down , and wanted Tea or Sugar for her Mistress , and Mr . Pain being out of Doors , she said . He was always out when he was most wanted ; that thereupon the Prisoner struck her on the Backside with the Poker , and said , You Sawcy Slut must my Master give you an Account ? and he thought he look 'd maliciously ; that the Maid push 'd him on the Shoulder , saying , What did you strike me for ? and that he thought him to be an ill-natur 'd Fellow . Ann Duncarton depos 'd , That about 7 Weeks since , she saw the Prisoner beat the Deceas 'd in the Back-Kitchin , and that afterwards the Deceas 'd said to her , Will my Mistress suffer this ? She asking her why the Prisoner beat her ? She said , Because she had taken some Sticks to light her Fire , that the Prisoner had laid by to light his . Elizabeth Green , the Deceased 's Mother , depos 'd , That on Easter-Tuesday she came to see her , and she said , Mother , I have been wild , and have not kept my Places , but now I am used so barbarously by my Fellow-Servant that I can not bear it ; she said she should not , she would come and give her Mistress Warning ; she reply 'd , she was willing to bear as long as she could , because she was bare of Cloaths , and knew her Mother was poor , and incapable to get them for her . The Prisoner in his Defence pleaded , That tho ' they had had high Words , yet they never had had Blows , and that , that Day they were very loving together ; and that he did not know that he touch 'd her with the Poker ; and as to the Man that came , with whom she drank , he only desir 'd him not to give her more Drink than would do her good ; that at Dinner-time , he had not ended his Dinner when he was call 'd out to draw Drink : and that the Deceas 'd went to draw two Pints of Drink , and having a Knife in her Hand , he ask 'd her what she did with that ? she reply 'd , What is that to you James ? That afterwards , when he had carry 'd out Drink , he went again into the Box to Dinner , and saw her sitting , leaning her Head on the Table , and said to him , James , I am a Dead Woman ; that he reply 'd , Dear Mary , What is the Matter with you ? and immediately , without making any Answer , she fell down dead ; and when he call 'd his Mistress he had not been in the Room a Minute . The Prisoner call 'd several Witnesses to prove that he did not seem to be any ways out of Temper that Day . On a full Hearing of the Matter , the Jury acquitted him .

He said , his Brother was Coachman to a fearful Old Man , and he would send him a Letter to send him a Parcel ; and he would have him , this Evidence , fix upon a House where the Parcel may be sent , and received , and he not suspected ; asking him , Is there not a House at Billingsgate , that you use , the Shoulder of Mutton ? will they have any Suspicion of you ? to which this Evidence reply 'd , I think not ; he desir 'd him , this Evidence , to go to the Shoulder of Mutton to see if the Parcel was come ; that he was to sit there , and call for Drink , and when a Porter came for a Parcel directed for John Harrison , if he suspected any thing , he should immediately go to the Krag's-Head Alehouse in King's-Head-Court , on Fishstreet-Hill : That while he was at the Shoulder of Mutton , a Porter came in , and brought a Piece of Paper , and asked for the Landlord , and said , Here is a Note , and that the Landlord 's Son came and look 'd on it , and gave his Father a Jog , and went and fetch 'd in another Man , and then gave the Porter the Parcel ; that he , this Evidence , seeing this , went to the King's-Head-Alebouse , and acquainted the Prisoner ; and they went thence into Moorfields , and the Prisoner said he was vex 'd that he was disappointed ; and that if he had gotten the Money , he design 'd to have given this Evidence 5 Guineas ; that they went to the Three Tuns , and had 2 penny worth of Bacon ; and the Prisoner said , tho ' he was disappointed in his Design now , he would write him another Letter that should make him tremble ; and that the 2d Parcel should be directed to be left at the Black-Boy in Goodman's-Fields , to John Harrison , as before ; for there the Man of the House had no Suspicion of him : That the Prisoner sent for him on the 1st Day of April to the Ship Alehouse in the Minories , sending his Name , that he would have something for Breakfast , and we had 2 Sheep 's Tongues ; he said , he came to have me go to the Black-Boy in Goodman's-Fields , to see if the Parcel were come thither , saying , You have nothing to do but to sit in the House and observe whether there be a Trap laid to catch me ; that they went to the Black-Boy , and there read the News-Paper , and it was said , nobody would ever appear since it was advertiz 'd ; that the Prisoner left this Evidence at the Black-Boy , and he was to meet the Prisoner at the Rose at Algate ; that a Porter came in , and Mr. Whitaker at the Black-Boy took the Note , and said , I had rather the Person had come for it himself , however you shall have it , and went to the Door , and a Man came up to him , then he gave the Porter the Parcel , and bid him go and deliver it to the Person ; that they went after the Porter , but on a different Side of the Way ; that he stay 'd afterwards , and drank a Pint of Drink , and then went to the Rose at Aldgate , and told the Prisoner , there was a Trap laid to catch him ; that after this , the Prisoner and he went to his Brother , who liv 'd with Mr. Newnham , and going to an Alehouse hard-by his Brother 's , they din 'd there , and his Brother came in , but said he could not stay , because he was going on an Errand , but said , he should be back quickly ; that accordingly he came and the Prisoner reply 'd him if he design 'd to come away , he said , no ; the Prisoner reply 'd , You have complain 'd your Master was cross and peevish ; ay , replies the Brother , but the Cause is known now , a vile Rogue has sent him a Letter to send him a great Sum of Money , threatening his Life if he did not ; to which the Prisoner reply 'd , ay , a vile Rogue indeed ; says the Brother , there is an Advertisement of it : That afterwards they went to the Sieve in the Little Minories , and read the Advertisement ; that from thence they went to the White-Swan in Goodman 's Fields ; the Prisoner said , he would endeavour to know when the Old Man came out of the Country , and he would send him another Letter ; to which this Evidence reply 'd , I am sorry you will meddle with such Affairs , they are very dangerous ; the Prisoner reply 'd , You need not fear , nothing can hurt you , but my Life is in your Hand , and if ever you discover the Matter , you shall share the same Fate . John Long , Mr. Newnham 's Servant , depos 'd , That a Letter came by the Penny-Post the 20th of March ; that he gave it his Master , and he having read Part of it , gave it to him , and bid him read it ; that the same Evening a Parcel was made up of about 2 lb . Weight , but not Money , in a brown Paper , directed to John Harrison , and he carried it the next Morning to Mr. Ward 's , at the Shoulder of Mutton ; and also , that another Letter came of the same Hand , dated the 27th of March , and a Parcel was made up , and directed for John Harrison , and carried to the Black-Boy in Goodman's-Fields . Mr. Ward depos 'd , That the Parcel was left with him by Mr. Long , directed for John Harrison ; that a Porter came with a Note , saying , he came from a Person at the Bell in Mincing-Lane ; that he and another went thi-but the Prisoner was gone , but left Word he was gone to the Custom-House , but would be there again presently . Mr. Benger at the Bell , said , a Man was there , and call 'd for a Pen and Ink , and wrote a Note , and wanted a Porter ; but that he took so little Notice of him , that he could not swear it was the Prisoner ; nor could Flinder , the Porter that carried the Note , swear to the Person . Mr. Whitaker , at the Black-Boy , confirm 'd the Evidence before given as to the Parcel being sent , and sent for , to his House . - Frisby depos 'd , That the Prisoner was the Person who sent him with a Note for a Parcel at the Black-Boy in Goodman's-Fields ; and that going to Newgate to see him , tho ' the Room was darkish , and 5 or 6 in the Room , he at first fix 'd positively on the Prisoner , as the Man that sent him for the Parcel to the Black-Boy in Goodman's-Fields . The 2 Letters were produc 'd and read in Court , the first demanding 85 Guineas , the latter 100 , full of Threatning Expressions ; and the latter full of vile Names , horrid Oaths , direful Execrations , and Threatnings of the Life of the Prosecutor , his Wife , & c. not fit to be publickly expos 'd ; notwithstanding which , several Persons of Reputation gave the Prisoner the Character of a sober and industrious Man : But the Fact being plainly prov 'd , the Jury found him guilty of the Indictment .
