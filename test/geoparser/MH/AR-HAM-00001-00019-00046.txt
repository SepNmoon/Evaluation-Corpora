Buxton June 8 th - 1773 I was made happy with My dearest Mary 's Letter of Sunday this morning & hope by this time her cold is quite gone & she as well as I wish her . I am extremely obliged to you for ſaying you follow the dictates of your inclinaton in writing me & not in obedience to my Com̅ands no command not agreeable to My dearest Ward ever shall be laid on her by me , its true I may have objections but never to hurt you in any way in the World . The Penseroſo prevail 'd on Saterday night at Derby & had it not been good luck more than good management in the Ostler I might have broke my neck for just in going into Leicester the fore Wheel of my Chaise came almost off & wd have been so , had not a Man in paſsing by obſerved it , & stop 'd me , when not a quarter of an inch was on , going down hill as fast as the horses could go . however Providence was kind to yr Guardian & he got by good fortune no harm . you ſay My Dearest Girl that Life is checker 'd so much the better for two reaſons first were we always to have what we pleased as changable beings we would tire of Life very ſoon & again were we always to be happy we wd- not know the difference between good & bad , of Course have but little or no dependence on God almighty to become worse or at least as bad as the Brute creation so remember what Pope ſays whatever is , is right Alexander Pope , An Essay on Man , Epistle I . . apropos to poetry I have just heard from a very senſible Clergyman of two vols . of Poems by one Byrom of Manchester just come out which I have ſent for and shall send to My dearest Mary as ſoon as poſsible adieu My dear Girl I must go drink water & walk for an hour after that I shall write more -- Returned to go on , The Kitten nor her Uncle has not as yet made their appearance however I have found a great number of friends here together with a thouſand water drinking acquaintances who People only knows at ſuch places -- I am extremely ſenſible My Dearest Girl of both your Mama 's & your own friendſhip for me , nor do I in the least doubt but both are aſsured of mine in every thing its in my power to ſerve either of you & believe me the many , many , Civilities I have received from both , shall , or rather will , never be forgot as long as I exſist . Indeed My Dearest Mary I would rather never hear from you ( a punishment worse than any almost sent on this earth ) then that you should in the least hurt your Eyes by writing me , next to the hearing you are well , is the hearing from you in short letters , next to that are long ones , & next , & I must ſay the greatest is being in your Company where the goddeſs of good humor precides together with that of saucineſs & indeed with friends the two Goddeſs 's ought alwise to be in the ſame Company the one at the head of the table , or as you please the ſide , the other always at the bottom repreſented by the only Girl who can make ſaucyneſs agreeable without affectation , I am afraid most ſaucy people splits there , not distinguishing the one for the other but I can always anſwer for my Ward doing right , I wish to God you was here that I might be truely happy & I think you would be well amuſed by ſome characters worthy of notice both among the Lady 's & Gentlemen & many we have here I can aſsure you that would give you pleaſure to laugh at , as well as to be pleased with -- So you little D——l you want me to get into ſome scrape or other wt- Mrs Rogers Dont you ? to write all that fine story to me to perswade me she is angry with me for not doing the thing in ye world I should have best liked , had time allowed me without doing what might have been inconvinient to her , viz the calling on her when not well , but tho I can not ſay you incouraged me to go it I safely can ſay you did not hinder me tho you laughed at me for not doing what my inclinations always led me too , paying my best respects to Mrs Rogers & the —— under the words to fold it up in due form convinces me that she does not expect a Note to apologise for my want of politeneſs so pray My Dear , Good , ſenſible , amiable , Satirical Ward dont laugh at your poor Guardian as that is quite abſurd , Ridiculous , nonsensical Stuff not very proper to use to your Guardian nor did I suppose Miſs Hamilton could be serious in writing ſuch a thing otherwise I most certainly would now have done myself the honor of paying my most respectfull Compliments to Mrs Rogers in any way that I thought would be most agreeable to her & I must ſay that it was her behaviour to you that first drew my attention towards her , as in all probability it would never been in my power to have had the Happineſs of her Acquaintance had it not been thro you -- I deſire , nay lay my Com̅ands on you to keep quite , dont go abroad , or even to the Garden till you are quite well under pain of my greatest displeaſure . Apropos I dont like that shyneſs you Seem to have got into , of never mentioning Hope always My Dearest dearest Girl put that confidence in me that I deſire & would chuse to be uſed by those I love & I would be sorry that you should think that I dont look on you as one that I love most sincerely , indeed My Dearest Mary I would rather give up all correspondance with you than suppose you did not at all times both speak & write your mind freely to me , I know the last is whats eaſiest to do by experience but for God ſake my Dear Girl never disguise thro modesty or any other thing your ſincere sentiments to me , perhaps & without doubt you may get a better adviſer but ſure I am that to the best of my abilities you never will get one that has your interest more at heart both as to your preſent and future expectations in this World , & to his ſincere wish for you by Prayer in the next . The Ladies 's Maids have got a dancing in ye next room & are making such a Noise that I must give over & as the post goes immediately you 'll get this to morrow so hoping I shall hear ſoon & that from the Heart in every station of your Life I shall now end , beging my most respectful Compliments to Mrs Hamilton & Mrs Rogers not forgeting Mrs Thursby and any friends you may think I have at Northn Adieu My dearest dearest Ward believe me most ſincerely your most affct- Couſin , friend , & Guardian , the two last I honor the first is meer chance not worth the regarding in respect to the two others God bleſs My dearest ward is the Prayer & wish of her Guardian can I say more than ye last word if poſsible , be so good as add it & believe me I 'll ſign Napier to it .
