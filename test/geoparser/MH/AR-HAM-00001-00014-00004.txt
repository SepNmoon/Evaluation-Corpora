Queens Lodge Sund a y Night My Dearest Tho I think it most likely that I shall not have five minutes , yet to convince you that I will ke p e p my word I take the Pen the first moment I can which is at a quarter before ten Sunday Night , I am writing to you from my own Room , which I am delighted with & where I hope we shall in due time spend some comfortable hours together , I hope to hear this day has been a happy one to you & that no unlucky expreſsion has embittered it , believe me my dear I most heartily & sincerely wish you happineſs , thorns there are in every state , but a contented mind I know by experience gathers the Roses notwithstand in g & such I am sure yours is . We arrived safe at the Castle at Seven last Night , & spent the Evg till 9 as usual , this Morg at eight we all went to the Chapel , after breakfasted in Mrs Hagedorn s new Room with Genl Fritag Genl Budé Col Hotham & Mr Arnald , The King Princes & all their Gentlemen afterwards took their walk , & the Queen read us a Sermon Ly Charlotte & Ly Egremont attending , nothing worth relating paſsed from that hour till nine there , when we proceeded to the Castle & dined in the same Room that you remember , I often thought of you & wished for you , dont die , but Baron Albrlaben dined with us & sat by me . To morrow their Majesties & c & c go to Eton to hear the Boys deliver their Speeches , I scarcely think I shall go as Pſs Elizh does not . God Bleſs you I can not add another line but to say that I am Afftly Yr MCG—— we do not set out till 6 o Clock Tuesd a y Evg Miſs Hamilton at Prince Ernest House Kew
