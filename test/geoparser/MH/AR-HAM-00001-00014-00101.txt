My Dear I heard from my Brother of yr- kind enquiries yesterdy & am much obliged by them , I did not receive any Letter from you , & fear it is lost , as I have had some forwarded to me from Malvern & Worcester since I returned home -- I am I thank God a great deal better , tho ' not free from Pain or shortneſs of Breath , but as the Queen is so gracious as to allow me not to make my appearance of a Morg before Ten o'Clock , nor to do any thing that can fatigue me , I trust , by by care I shall go on tolerably well , but so old a Complaint as mine I can not expect to get quite rid of . I shall always be glad to see you , as will the rest of yr- Friends here , who I know would send many kind wishes if they knew I was writing -- Adieu Sincerely Yr- M C Goldsworthy Queens Lodge Tuesdy Morg Miſs Hamilton Bullstrode
