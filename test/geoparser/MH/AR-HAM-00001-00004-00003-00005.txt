London November 21 st 1785 . / My dear Cousin ./ I receiv 'd your friendly Letter about a Week ago -- You told me to write to you whenever I had leisure I hope you will excuse my not having done it , as I have b een much agitated lately , by the expectation of my dear Sister -- She arriv 'd in London last Thursday -- I leave you to conceive my joy upon seeing her , after an absence of upwards of 3 years & a half -- my joy is much embitter 'd by her being to stay a very short time in London -- I fear not a Week longer -- it breaks my Heart to think of our separation , for Heaven knows when we shall meet again -- we may to be sure , sooner than we expect , for this meeting was a chance./ We took her last Saturday to Brumpton to see Lady Warwick , and this Morning to Wandsworth-Hill to Lady Stormont 's -- Lord & Lady Stormont are well , but rather uneasy about little Charles Murray , who has got a Cold that occasions a swelling in his Throat./ My Brother is with us at present , and desires to be remember 'd to you -- he also bids me to give Mr : de la Gyfardière 's Compliments to you , who he says he saw not long ago./ Poor Mr : Glover is likely to die very soon -- how I pity Mrs : and Miſs Glover ! he will be such a loſs to them . -- have been out very little as yet -- I have been once at the Play -- not on a Night that Mrs : Siddons perform 'd -- she expects to be confin 'd the latter end of this Month , yet goes on performing still ; and as I am told , if poſsible better than ever -- she is a wonderful Creature is she not ? -- Is Mr : Dickenson return 'd to you yet ? if he is , pray prese nt my Compliments to him -- Are your Caves and Grottoes finish 'd yet ? -- London is not yet near full as you may suppose -- the Parliament sat so late , that people are glad to make the Summer as long as they can , now they are out of Town./ I go on practising Music as much as ever -- I hope I have made some improvement this last Summer ; you tell me it is thought so -- Are Miſs Dickenson 's musical ? Mr : Dickenson was is I remember , very fond of Music./ When do you intend to visit London ? I suppose not this Winter , as you are so much pleas 'd with your present situation./ My Brother was much gratified by your writing to him -- he is very affectionate -- he does not forget those who show friendship to him./ I am told that I look a great deal stronger for having spent the Summer in the Country -- I bath 'd pretty constantly , which was of great service to me I believe -- tho ' there was nothing the matter with me./ This is a very stupid Letter but I ca n't help it ; I have no news to tell you./ My Father and Mother are very well -- Accept their best Wishes , with those of My Sister , and believe me , my dear Cousin , yours affectionately./ J : Hamilton . / P : S : Make my Father 's and Mother 's Compliments to Mr : Dickenson .
