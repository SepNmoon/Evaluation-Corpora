Wednesday Octber . 8 th - where we are stop 'd for a days rest -- I hope My Dr Miſs Hamilton that you received the letter I wrote you from Mannheim not for the entertainment it contain 'd ( for in that respect it was not worth reading ) but to shew you my affection & that I did not forget my promise -- from the time I wrote that letter I was so taken in airing & trying to get up a little strength for my journey that I ha d no time to write -- I liked Spa better towards the latter part of my time than the first , Mrs Graham & I lived very much together & the Spencers took to her very which gave me great satisfaction -- I saw a good deal likewise of Ly Drogheda Ly Hertford s daughter who is a sweet amiable woman & two or three other good sort of people wch . made me paſs my time very agreably & I really was sorry to come away -- one circumstance however damp 'd every enjoyment , wch . was the melancholy situation of the poor Delewarr family -- I told you in my last that there were great hopes of him , but those hopes became so fluctuating that when we came away there seem 'd to be little hopes of ever getting him away -- I never saw any thing so touching as the Scenes , every day among in that family , they are all amiable , & suffering , & suffer so mildly , that one wishes to remain with them to comfort them , tho ' at the same time it breaks ones heart . I am sure you will comprehend that feel . -- From Spa we came to Spa & from thence embarkd on the Rhine & were four days getting to Bonn from whence we came by land to Mayence . Sr Wm . went the next day to the Theatre at Manheim , where the Elector happen 'd to be , & ( tho ' in a frock in the Pit ) he did him the honor to send his first Minister to him to desire that both he & I , would dine with him the next day at Manheim where the Electreſs is at present , & the day after at Ogersheim when he is in the Country -- Sr Wm . accepted for himself , but said I was so tired with my journey that I could not dreſs , by which I got two days rest , but by order of the Elector we had a great Concert given us at Count Savioli 's the Directeur des Spectacles , & the last Night ( as I did not chuse to go out ) they gave me another concert at my own lodging -- in short nothing could be more Polite & attentive -- from Swezinghe we set out in pursuance of our Plan of being at Manheim by the 4 th - of Novr . -- & the day before Yesterday were stop 'd at a place calld Naples by meeting the D. of Gloucester who upon hearing we were changing horses sent to desire to see us -- we obey 'd his R Hſs- s commands & found him at dinner -- but I own to you I was shock 'd , his legs are as big as my waist , his face that of a Corpse , his hair almost totally fallen off , & what remains quite red , he sent for his Children to shew us & look 'd at them with tears in his eyes , I see he is hopeleſs , & I fear with reason , for I can not think he ever will get the better of his illneſs -- nature is worn out , & I suppose the Winter will finish all he has no use of his legs & is carried from place to place -- What is birth ? What is greatneſs ? all All , a prey to Death , & Subject to every pain & distreſs but why do I moralize with you ? -- I should not forget to tell you there is a Marqse Trotti & her daughters at Goppingen who love you & I liked them for it -- I felt I liked them , & that that , was the reason , for I know little of them -- when you have a n proper Oppertunity My Dr Miſs Hamilton -- expreſs my respectfull Duty to our Charming & Valuable Queen -- the more I see & hear of Sovereigns & princes the more I admire & love her & think you happy in your situation , let me know how you go on , You know how much you interest me -- My kind love attends Mrs Hamilton -- Sr Wm . joins in his to you both & I am ever Yr truly Affecte Aunt C Hamilton To Miſs Hamilton at The Right Honble .
