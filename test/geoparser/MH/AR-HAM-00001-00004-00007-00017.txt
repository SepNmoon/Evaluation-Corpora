1st Lady Hamilton from Naples to her Sister in law Mrs Charles Hamilton before 1771 My Dr Sister I have waited long with a great impatience hoping to have the pleasure of hearing from you but finding it in Vain I can resist no longer & must take up my pen to tell you that it has been a real Mortification both to Mr Hamilton & Myself not to hear from you or Mr Hamilton -- I hope however this will put you both in Mind that we are still in the Land of the Living & that both neither of us have not forgot your kindneſs & Attentions to us -- & be assured we never shall , particularly my self -- therefore it will be needleſs to repeat that we beg to hear from you both -- I have quite recover 'd my health in this Country which is a great point gain 'd for me , but as to Society ( I mean such as I can like ) it is almost impoſsible to procure it , however I am very well contented for while I can have Mr Hamilton s Company I do not want any other -- he is as much disgusted with the Neapolitan Manners as I am , we therefore stay at home as much as the proper Ceremonys of his Situation will permit , none of which he ever omits for fear of offending -- our house is very comfortable it is without one of the Gates of the City & so retird from all noise . that we may fancy ourselves in the Country -- we have a full View of the Bay of Naples ( which is just under our Window ) & the Island of Capria , in short the Air & Situation is certainly very fine & I wish you & Mr Hamilton would come & try it -- at present there are no diversions going forward except one two little Vile theatres leſs than the little one in the haymarket where people sit five hours to hear very pretty Musick very ill perform 'd & Nonsensical Works acted with the lowest Buffoonery -- but such is the Neapolitan taste , & they look upon a good Punchinello as a most Respectable Character , next Monday the great theatre begins , it is so large that with difficulty you hea r the Voices , so that altogether in th is Country of Musick there is very li ttle Good to be heard except that of the Churches which is really charming -- & Now My Dr Mrs Hamilton I will bid you Adieu & only Add Hamilton s & My Love to your Self Mr Hamilton & your daughter I hope to hear soon from you & am My Dr Sister Yr Most Affecte & Obligd humble Servt C.
