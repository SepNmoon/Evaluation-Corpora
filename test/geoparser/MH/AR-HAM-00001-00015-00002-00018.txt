18 th . July 1781 Babel I am perfectly recover 'd my Dear Astrea & I deserve Your reproaches for my silence -- I know not how it is but I feel incapable of exerting myself -- I neglect & postpone doing the very things from which I might derive comfort , for I am sure receiving Your letters is one of my greatest , & yet I delay writing & thereby lose many letters from You . I ought to answer Your enquiries respecting the Synod ; after tomorrow it will be once a fortnight -- therefore the 16 th of Augt . is ye . Synod day -- but as that is Mercury s Birth day I think it most probable it will not be held . -- Atoſsa has a Cold & we are left this week at Babel -- Ah how you would feel for me did You know what I have gone through on her account -- she is the most deceitful , as well as the most treacherous and dangerous young person I ever met with -- imagine to yourself my surprize when Rhea after having told me came into my room the other day , & said she wish 'd to question me about a conversation I had had wth . Atoſsa last Winter -- I being perfectly aſsured I had never said any thing to her that I ought not , was not alarm 'd , however I was astonished at this addreſs : Rhea then told me that Elise had repeated to her what Atoſsa had told her , I had said against ye . person who wrote to you lately about me when I was Ill ; had it been so , had I told her in confidence my opinion of yt . lady it wd . have been very base in her to have repeated it wth . a view of making mischief ; but wt . renders it so shocking is , that the whole was a falsehood . Rhea behaved with the utmost candour & gave me a fair opportunity of clearing myself . after this instance of Atoſsa 's disposition for mischief-making , to give it not harsher a severer epithet ; I shall live in a continual dread of some secret stab . -- for how is poſsible to guard against such a being . this affair has made a stronger impression upon me that they think it has done , for it makes me wish a thousand times a day that I had never enter 'd into this situation . I can not conceal from You that I am very unhappy -- I desire you will not on any account mention this trait of Atoſsa s character as it might prejudice the world greatly against her were it made public . I make one exception -- when You & Ldy . W . are alone together show her this letter -- It will be a comfort to me to have You sympathize together in concern for Your friend . I recd . a kind letter from Mrs. Walshingham Hero abt . a fortnight ago -- she says she intends coming to Babel as soon as her Affairs are settled -- so I hope we may look forward for some happy meetings before Winter as I make no doubt but that Hero will invite You . Helen & her Daughter have been at the Walk every Evening -- which is , & has been much the topic of every tea table within ten Miles ; ( for very slight notice is taken of ym . by Osyris , Rhea & even P W . ) -- they say it is wanting proper spirit , & it is a matter of astonishment at the family House , that a person who is so delicate , that ye . leas t fatigue overcomes ym . shd . be able to set out in ye . heat of ye . afternoon & walk two hours -- one Eveg . last week they came in ye . Rain & ye . family party were not there . so much for scandal -- where I to send you all yt . this place affords I might be employ 'd some hours every day , the Germans are going from Old Babel various are the reason 's aſsign 'd for their quitting that place -- when we meet we will talk over what is not of importance enough -- or of too much importance to write . What would I not give to be able to spend a few days wth .. You in the Country ; tell Benedict & Isabella yt . I shall feel for them when you quit H—— . you say the W - have not visited You -- You may be content they have not , for I believe he is a very ignorant stupid Man , & I do not imagine there is much to regret in not being acquainted with his Wife -- Mr. T . of A—— is a very worthy Man but is so devour 'd by Nerves that he will not make a good Neighbour for Benedict -- pray take some pains to find out the Character of his eldest daughter , I am greatly interested abt . her for her poor Mothers sake -- I shall be very much delighted if You find her to be a proper companion for Is—— as they are suitable in age , situation & c : I know she has talents & I hope she is amiable -- when Yo . see her say a great deal from me & aſsure her though I have not wrote , that I often think of , & enquire after her -- tell her I am now ashamed to write & if she will aſsure send me her forgiveneſs by You I will venture . As this letter is just the length of five or six of Yours put together You have no longer , a right to complain -- & I promise also ( if Yo . will send me frank 's directed to H . ) to write as often as We used to do -- Adieu my Dearest friend -- fail not to answer this in full immediately -- God Bleſs You Adieu I rejoice yt . Yr . B has had ye . M . Mary Hamilton I suppose you have heard of ye . Balls -- at Miranda s , at Bushy Park & Ldy . Egremont give 's one soon They talk much of Ldy . Aylesford s attachment to Ld .
