Bath 19 th . June 1789 -- Ma tres chere femme I am at last arrived in this Town and am writing to you in Miſs S. Nicolls Apartments -- First of all I shall begin with my Journal -- At Buxton I found my Company consisted of a Little lively Italian a sickly Frenchman an English Bear who had travelled a great deal , who was so extremely like John Spencer , that at first I was surprised at his presumption -- & I found the resemblance to be equally strong in temper & manners -- the other was a Rider -- at Ashborn a woman about 4 times the size of Betty Shallcroſs got into our very small Coach , which She half filled -- And had I not been an intruder , I certainly wd . not have admitted her -- for two of us were obliged to go on the Outside -- I took my post there from Litchfield to Birmm -- The Air was intensely t ar t , otherwise that mode of travelling is pleasant , as one may see more of a Country than on Horseback -- ten miles from Birmm . we took up a person who soon entered into Conversation with me -- in the course of it he entered into a minute detail of the inside of Warwick Castle which he is perfectly well acquainted with -- he was the person who bro-t . Mr. Ladbroke in for the Town -- wh . he did from a publick Spirit -- he said he had always been extremely attached to the family & would now do any thing in his power to serve them -- but the manner in wch . the town was treated vexed him & having his Spirits raised with a bottle of Wine , he unfortunately gave his promise to Mr. Ladbroke which tho he repented , he Would not retreat -- The Sum of twenty Guineas given in a handsome manner at a particular time would have prevented Robert 's losing his Seat -- but Ld . W—— thought the Inhabitants so much at his command , that no Act of Attention or Civility was neceſsary from him to keep them subservient to him -- This Man 's name is Wilmot , Brother to Dr. W—— of Warwick . he is a painter -- in consequence of his Opposition to the Ws . , he has lost a place & c of the value of 9000 L to him & has been obliged to resume his profession in Birmm- which he had left off for many years He did not know that I was at all interested in this conversation -- it is a pleasant thing to see the Springs of Actions -- At Birmm- I found there was no room in the Bristol Coach was just setting out & that the Bath Coaches go only on three days a Week & that I must stay till Thursday morng wh . I did not like to do so I engaged a place at the Swan , to wh . Inn I removed , for the next afternoon for Bristol , as I determined to take that Opporty of seeing Miſs Mores -- I went to a circulating Library to get a Book where I met with a very extraordinary boy of 12 years old -- he answered my questions in such a manner that I could not help laughing & supposed that he was aping his Master who probably might be a pedantick Bookworm I asked him if he was fond of reading ? O yes Sir I read a great deal . Plays & novels I suppose ? O no , I never read such books as those -- pray what is yr- favorite Study ? Divinity Sir ? and whose book 's do like best ? Watts I like but Watson is my favorite Author -- just then his Mistreſs came into the Shop -- who told me “ that the little old Man had made his Election ” I enquired on what his choice had fallen . She said the Anabaptist Church -- which he said was the only perfect one -- I left the Shop taking with me a translation of Voltaire s history of Peter the great -- Wednesday -- I was engaged in reading till it was too late to have much conversation with this religious boy when I returned the book -- There happened to be a Man there who told me that the Master was so fond of him that he wd . not be without him for a 1000L & that if he was his Child & his only one he could not have a greater regard for him -- The boy is an orphan -- just before we set out a Gentleman desired I would give him leave to go in the Coach as all the places were taken -- As one was a young girl I consented but afterwards repented , from the additional seat which a fifth person occasioned -- he was a dissenting Minister a young Man & agreeable enough -- We had also a ve ry s illy weak woman & her Abigail -- who sat op po site to me -- the only amusement I had was in making the Maid laugh at her Mistreſs 's Nonsense which I did by reminding her now & then with my knees poor Soul I 'm sure Her back wd . ache , & God help her for serving such a Fool -- We supped at Worcester I came on the outside from Bromsgrove & found it extremely pleasant , as the heavy rain in the morning had laid the dust at Tewksbury I did not feel quite comfortable as we found that some Accident had happen 'd almost every Night lately and broken bones were spoken of with y- utmost indifference -- I thought of my dear Mary & her sweet Bedfellow -- We however arrived safe at Bristol at 7 OClock -- after being 15 hours upon the road without Sleep and having plenty of disagreeable expectations , no conversation , my companions were snoring round me & to compleat my happineſs I cd . not rouse a Servant till 8 OClock when I got some hot Water which I used as a Succedaneum for a warm bath -- changed my Linnen , by wch . I was tolerably refreshed -- The rain fell inceſsantly till 10 OClock when I went to Miſs More 's -- I found Hannah & Patty were absent but received a hearty welcome from the rest -- with whom I spent a most agreeable day -- diner en famille -- had a great deal of pleasant conversation & left them with regret at 4 -- when I had a smart run to be in time for my Coach -- I shall write more about this visit in my next & shall only now say that They said there was little doubt of a certain person 's having married a common Woman at Plymouth many year 's ago , whh . Acct . they had from their own Mother -- I was very sorry to hear it indeed -- I came to Bath at 6 yesterday & was received with open Arms by the Rundells where I spent the Evg . Mrs. Rundell fixed me at Mr. Davis 's No . 16 Queens Square -- Mr. Rundell say that a few times bathing will relieve me -- the irritation is owing to Bile 's being thrown to the outward parts of the body where it is too thick to paſs thro ' the pores -- he told me that a few Drops of Laudanum would always give me relief -- I 'm sure he loves us both , he wishes to see Louisa -- Sally is just come down in papillotes to tell me that Opera house is burnt down & I 'm to say a 1000 things for her -- the best thing I can say is yt- She lives by herself & that her Sisters have left her -- God for ever bless & preserve you my dear dear Mary , kiſs our dear Louisa for herself & me think of me & always love me , half as much as you are beloved by Yr . faithful J.D -- my Love to my Father & Sisters -- I am not to Drink the Waters or bathe till Sunday -- Dr. Rundell -- Mrs. Dickenson -- Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire X Post . --
