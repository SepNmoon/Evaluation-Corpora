Written in 1782 to Pſs —— Adieu -- perhaps for ever ! Though I leave you , never will I forget you -- I will only endeavour to forget yr . unkindneſs ; age and experience will teach yo . to prize a sincere friend as ye . most inestimable treasure you can poſseſs -- Adieu may Heaven preserve you ! I have , & ever will be your true st & attach 'd friend . I act and speak from ye . strictest principle of honor , it has hitherto supported me , & I trust will support me through life . Let me live in yr . remembrance and wish me happineſs . suffer yourself for a moment to imagine yo . are taking leave of an affte- friend , think of me as one yt . is dead & who merited when living yr . esteem . My plans for ye . future are now settled -- you can no longer wish to influence my actions -- I forgive you the unkind -- ungenerous part you have acted towards me -- I forgive you all the exquisite anxiety of mind I have suffer 'd -- for still I am too much yr . friend to allow myself to think yo . deliberately endeavour 'd to wound its peace . May yo . meet wth . a friend true , sincere , and disinterested as I have ever been to you , & when you do never betray or desert them . Whil st e I live my prayers for your happineſs will be duly offer 'd -- for , Mon amitié est indiſsoluble !
