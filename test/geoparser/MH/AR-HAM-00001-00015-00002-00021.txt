28 th . June 1782 What shall I say to you My friend in excuse for having so long delay 'd writing -- indeed I have none to offer but that I was indolent & stupid , yet was I unreasonable enough every Morning to be expecting letters from You & to feel disappointed that I did not receive any -- You are very good to me -- I acknowledge it , & yet I know not how it is , but I do feel , & have done so for some time past , that I am no longer the first upon your list of friends -- this idea of mine does not proceed from any mean jealousy of disposition -- but from the affection I bear towards you & wch : I want to feel , has an adequate return . The whole winter , I was unhappy -- I endeavour 'd notwithstanding to conceal my apprehension as I was not willing to lose the share I still retain 'd of your Affection by tormenting you with my co njectures -- and my Dear friend pardon me for having now mention 'd any thing about it -- I have so long endulged myself in laying my heart open to you that I could not resist the present impulse . You will have the pleasure of seeing Lady W—— next week -- I recd . a few lines from her yesterday , she told me Sr. Wm . was better & had taken two or three airings on Horseback -- that Sr. R. Jebb had taken leave of him , but had strongly recommended him to try Buxton ; She fears he will not go there if he finds himself better when he gets into the Country -- I beg you & Sr. R . will use all your influence in persuading him to go thither for I think his a very precarious life and that every precaution is necessary for its preservation . I hope my love all your anxieties about yor . F have long been over & that he is quite well again . how long are you to stay at Horton ? and when are you to pay your Visit to Hero ? Mr : Thursby has been here to see his Daughter , I saw him twice & had two delightful rides wth . Miſs T—— as he brought Horses with him -- he promised to call & tell you about our little excursions . -- We have not accompanied their M—— to Kew & London either this week or the last -- my time has been equally occupied as for during their absence Thursday -- I do not take my Eveg out of waiting viz . the Thursday . I have not yet seen Hero & I do not think she is come -- I shall enquire to day . Adieu Ever tenderly yours Honble Miſs Gunning Free Wake Horton Newport Pagn el Bucks
