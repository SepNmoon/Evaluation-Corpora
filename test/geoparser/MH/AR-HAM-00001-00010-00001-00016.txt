From A M to Mr Dickenson her rival in devotion to M H . Clarges Street Feb 23 d 1785 Your agreeable Letter gave your Sister great pleasure , I sincerely participate in the happineſs you enjoy at present , & that you with my dear Miranda may never see another cloud overcasting your happineſs is one of the first wishes of my heart your situation was a very delicate one & I was sensible of it at the time . Our Miranda is well : often saucy always agreeable & plus & plus chere à mon Coeur . -- shall we ever quarrel -- which of us loves or will love her best ? I hope a great Deal to pretend , many years acquaintance & society & intimacy . -- Ah but you were acquainted with her first , -- but then I know of merit that you have not been witneſs of . I have seen her ill & well at Court at home & in the World . & I have seen how meritoriously she has conducted herself in every most difficult situation , I hope however , we never shall take it into our heads to dispute on this subject , if we do , we shall both have argument enough . The expreſsions in yours respecting that important or unimportant Ar female article Dreſs -- has occasioned much debate & conversation . -- I read Miranda a gentle Lecture upon it she was a emporté un peu . she would re read your Letter , she was angry at that unfortunate word happineſs shall I tell you why I believe she was angry ? because she wishes to please you in every thing -- but she never would study Dreſs she knows aſsey bien , that she can charm without it , & she despises it ; she thinks it takes too much time & that it is expensive -- I wish she do not play you some tricks , -- so be upon your guard for her saucy s eyes are meditating something . -- malgré all this . I laugh at her . & tell her that I am s certain she will think more of dreſs when she finds that you like to see her well dreſsed . -- she believes nothing of it -- , she suffers me to lecture . Be to complain & you to request hope wish & c. & soars above it all , she has some pretensions to give herself airs we are conscious , -- but we will not permit it . I have just room to tell you that I am impatient to see you here & that I am Miranda 's & your most sincere friend A M—— One thing Miranda said last night on the subject of dreſs I omitted which was that she thinks it indispensable that a Woman should be always perfectly neat in her dreſs . & she is certain that you have always seen her so -- I send you a little Note I received from dear Lady Wake this moment -- pray return it to me when you see me -- John Dickenſon Esq : Jun --
