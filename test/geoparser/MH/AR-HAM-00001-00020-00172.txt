4 , Suffolk Street Charing Croſs 20 th - April 1802 My Dear Sister , Had you told me where Mr. Hawkins Browne lived , poſsibly I might have sent a Meſsage to his house , in your Name . But , really , I have not had leisure to hunt out Dutcheſses , and Lady Cecilia 's , to obtain the means of obeying your Commands . I was concerned for Mrs- Browne 's death , because She was an old acquaintance , and a Valuable Woman , but , I never visited her , or her husband , since she married . Lady Cis , no longer lives in South Audley Street . She has sold that house , and removed to Wimpole Street , where I do not fatigue her with Visits . I believe the Definitive Treaty is arrived , and a Leveé tomorrow has been announced in this Evening 's Gazette . As an old Courtier , You will know that the King did not use to hold one in this holiday Week . There is likewise to be a Council . I expect the Official Notification of my new Dignity tomorrow Morning , and if it arrives in time , shall kiſs the King s hand at the Leveé . Next week , I mean to go North , & as far as I know at present , my Miſs will return with me . She was at the Lord Mayors Ball last Night , was three hours on her progreſs to it , and had the satisfaction of having a Pannel of the Carriage , she was in , shattered to peices . Providentially , there was nobody hurt by the accident . With my best Love to Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , & my Countrywoman , I ever am , My Dear Sister , Your Affecte- Brother Napier Wednesday 21 st . April I have this moment returned from kiſsing the Royal Paw , and now shall fill up my time till Dinner , in scribbling . Adieu London , Twenty First April 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds . Napier .
