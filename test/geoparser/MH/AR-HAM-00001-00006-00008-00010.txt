Forgive me my dear , Miſs Hamilton , for not waiting on you to Tea . -- The Sorrows of my friends & those of my Friend Own are too much for me in one day . -- I have taken a Walk of two hours , to drive away Care ; but am come home rather more burthen 'd with Thought , than when I ſuddenly left your House . -- If you ſhould not hereafter ſee me so frequently as I could wiſh , impute it not to Ingratitude for the Share your Mama & you have taken in my Distreſs , but to my unwillingneſs to prove troubleſome to my friends , or to disturb their happier cheerful Hours . -- When I am ſerene I ſhall pay my Respects to my friends again , 'till then my beſt & fervent Wiſhes attend them . -- Your ſincereſt Friend
