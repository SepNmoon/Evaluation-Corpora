Sunninghill 11 th . Augt . 1800 Ansed . 30 th - My Dear Mrs. Dickinson It is a long time since I have had the pleasure of hearing from you , it 's true , Your good Man , did call upon me , in the Month of April , but did not stay three minutes , I had not time to inquire after You , & Your Dear Daughter , whom I have a great regard for & c- & c . in the Month of June , I had a great deal of busineſs upon my hands , of the greatest importance , & did not leave Town till the fourth of July -- since I came here , I have been in the midst of dust , & owing to the two Camps , horse & foot , being stationd very near us , which at times has made me very Croſs , there is nothing to be got here , every thing goes to the Camp , am oblig 'd to go to Windsor , for every thing that is good , is not that enough to make one Croſs , this hot Weather , my good friend ( we very seldom stir out to Walk , when we d o id , almost ancle in dust ) the dear King has brought this upon us , for his own amusement , I am glad he his gone to Weymouth , I hope to hear soon the Camp will be broke up , I am quite sick of the sight of a Red Coat -- I never whent to one of the great feild Days , what with smoke , & dust , I cou 'd not find out the pleasure of it , Miſs Walker whent with a Party , & paid very dear for her amusement , got a very bad cold , swell 'd face , & was laid up above a week , my Sister whent with some friends I had with me , Capt . & Mrs. Saltwell , I like the foot Camp very much , & I have been very often , one Evening a large party of us drank Tea in Coln . Johnson Markee , in number 15 . Lady Harewood the Tibbalds party , & ours , they have a very fine Band of Music , which makes it very agreeable indeed -- Lady Harewood goes constantly , but I shou 'd not like to go every Night , but one always meets with a great many of ones acqaintance , pleasant enough . I hope soon we shall be reinstated to our rural felicity , but nothing can repair the Garth being tore up , but some good showers of Rain -- Our friends at Broomley , I have not heard any thing of them , of some time , the last time I saw Miſs A : Clarke She talk 'd of taking her Sister Bell to the Sea side , She thought her o of health , I told her I did not th ink it a prudent scheme , but I dont know , done what has been done -- we have not had such a hot & dry Summer for many years , I hope we shall have a good harvest , & then I truſt , it will set all right again , no meat under 9 or 10 pence per pound , Bread 18 pence the quartern loaf , the poor must have sufferd greatly , thank God the Bread is falling , but not so much as it ont -- Mrs. Ashwell has been in Town , at a friend s house , the Lady she was with , appear 'd very stiff , so I did not trouble her any more , I askd the two ladies to my Aſsembly , but they were engag 'd , & gave me to understand they were full of engagements . remember me to Mrs. Morris , She is a great favorit of mine , in my Openion there is few like her , is your good father with you , if , he his , pray give my best to him -- We all unite in best respects to you , & Yours , from your sincere friend E Glover best Com pliment to Mrs Mrs. Dickinson Leighton house Staines
