A M Clarke at the Post Office Deal Kent My dear Friend I was much gratified by the receipt of yours & happy to learn that my dear Lady Anson & your Family were well the distance I am from you is a sad bar to the comforts of society & a Bulletin of health is extremely interesting were you to add no more I wish you would reflect on this & give me a few lines on your return from the delightful Tour you have in contemplation the time of your intended departure you did not mention however I will direct this to yourself or dear Louisa that in case you should have taken your flight it may not be any trouble to you What you said respecting our residing at this distance interests me as I have the same sentiments on the subject : our being fixed here which seems to be the case does not happen in consequence of Isabella 's health only my own from debility of constitution though I thank God I enjoy a good state of health & am exempted from all pain & suffering at present , appears to require the bracing air of the Sea-Coast I have scarcely any degree of strength & this air with constantly taking the tincture of bark appears to revive me in an extraordinary manner I was affected by a severe Cough at Kensington though the winter was mild I have been here a year without a Cold or the least tendency to coughing added to this inducement the air agrees with my Sister whose health is more imperfect than mine & the consideration of expence as we can have a very comfortable & neatly furnished Lodging at Deal for nearly half the price which makes a considerable difference in our Income . I had a very kind invitation from Mrs Steers in the spring which I could not accept & have just received another to go to Chelsea in the Autumn which perhaps I may avail myself of for a month I fear you will will not be returned from your Northern expedition -- with Mrs Steers I am at liberty to visit my friends in Town she is glad to have me gratified by the society of those I love as well as as by hers & if I should not want resolution on the occasion I shall sometimes make her a visit I think I could leave my Sister with all neceſsary comforts as the person with whom we now lodge would be very attentive to her we engage a very worthy Girl to serve us -- & we have another to go out with her ( the Daughter of our Landlady ) on account of her deafneſs which has of late years increased -- I thank you for the interesting account you give of the 3 dear Children it pleases me to hear that the youngest resemble his amiable Mother because she is such a striking likeneſs of my beloved Friend which makes a strong impreſsion on my mind whenever I look at her I believe the resemblance is in the Eyes & form of the face -- àpropos I have been some time employed in reading & destroying Letters from Friends in time pas t & I am now exceſsively interested in reading over some of yours & my dear Friend it is a sad but swet sweet gratification folios from Bullstrode the account of your introduction there & how much you were liked encomiums of our dear friend in yourself such anxiety respecting the suspence & difficulties of some circumstances not explained that she could not continue the Diary you attribute to my memory my dear friend more than it merits though it is I think a tenacious one in many respects I thought I had seen you the first time you came to L though absent on your arrival I thought you first lodged in Queen Street -- I think it probable you were at Mr. Glover 's at the time you mentioned for you were out three times in London I believe I was at Horwood with my dear Sister . I think I can say that I was about when you were at Mr. Glover 's as I have no recollection of your being at any house , but excepting a Lodging when I was with you & I should have remembered had you come to & fro from Albemarle Street respecting la belle paſsion I know know two amiable minds minds are deeply engaged by the powerful charm at the same time I have been very attentive to find out by the Letters what you wish but have not suceeded owing to the discontinuance of the Journal extract Mr D was expected at Bullstrode 27 or 29 Nov 18 1784 Mr D returned to Derb the Country in about 3 weeks from 3 Dec 1784 I am sorry I can not resolve this -- Now my dear Brother believing you are sufficiently occupied before your departure I can not expect a Letter but I intreat you on your return & as soon as poſsible to inform me of your health & safe return I shall be truly vexed if you should not comply as you know I have no hopes of hearing from dear Lady A—— I have had the satisfaction of hearing that my dear Niece is happily settld in Lincolnshire with her four Children she has a pretty House a Garden full of fruit a pair of Ponies & a Cow the plaice is pretty & she invites me & Isabella I am grieved for Lord N it must have been the Palsy Adieu my dear friend all comforts attend you I am happy you travel yours A M C Remember me particularly to Sir William & dear f naughty Louisa & by all means write on your return x John Dickenson Esqr or Lady William Anson Devonshire Place Cavendish Square London
