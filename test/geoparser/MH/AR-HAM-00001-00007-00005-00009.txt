Lisbon Saturday April 14 . 178 0 1 . It has pleased God that we should at last arrive here yesterday after a very stormy comfortleſs voyage of eleven days , and in heath sufficient to bear a more trying scene than my utmost apprehensions had figured to me , though thank God not so dreadful a one as it might have been ; for three weeks ago , there was not the smallest expectation of my dearest dearest Brother 's life -- his disorder at that time was they think at its crisis , for it has since turned to a violent and painful attack on his Bowels , strong enough to destroy any person in perfect health , but to him it seems to restore strength , I suppos 'd by removing the obstructions that has oppreſs 'd him , -- when I say it restores strength to him I must add that you can not , ( or they say we either ) have an Idea of the weakneſs to which he has been reduced , he appeared lifeleſs for 24 hours in his last attack , and was for a long time unable to speak , hear or lift his hand to his head , and in this state he was , just about the time that we were at Exeter ; so think my Dest —— . if the worst had happened , there would have been no opportunity of stopping us , and the conclusion of our voyage yesterday , during the whole of which my Mother was in a state of suffering and illneſs , must I think with such a blow , have made an end of her . I can hardly recover the horror which such an Idea gives me , though I am sure it ought to encrease our thankfulneſs for finding him as we do , not only alive and in a recovering way , but really free from disorder except that attack on his bowels which they look on to be the saving of his Life -- we anchored about 12 or 1 o'clock yesterday , and got on shore at two having apprized my Brother - of our arrival by Mr. Conyers who went off off with the first Boats . Mr. Graham was so good as to come into our Boat , and was the first person that gave us an idea of the dreadful State my Brother had been in , and of his present reduced one ; -- which he did in so gentle and gradual a manner as enabled my Mother and all of us to bear the shock better than we could have hoped , but no preparation cd . fit us for supporting the first sight of him -- however thank God he does not seem the worse for it to day , and Dr. Hare & Dr Payne both repeatedly aſsure us that they look on him as at present out of danger . My Mother is as you will believe quite unable to write , indeed I have not told her I am doing so , for I meant to write only one Letter to Mrs. Habback to be shewn to all our friends ; however my Dest . —— I have since found time for this , and I know their —— and your dear —— are so gracious & good in their enquiries that I thought you might wish to have such an Account as you cd . keep by you , which could not have been the case with that which Mrs. Habback is to carry to every body -- My Mother is I think better of the disorder she has had in her Stomach during our whole expedition , but not well -- the sea sickneſs did her harm rather than good -- Ht . bore it better than I expected Yrs- Sincerely S.F we are in the same Hotel with my Brother , which is a great Comfort .
