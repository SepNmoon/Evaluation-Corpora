1 st . 22 d . July 1779 Thursday Morng . My dearest dearest dearest Friend , After ye promise I made of accounting for my conduct especially in some particular instances which may perhaps have struck you most , I now take up my Pen to unburden my whole Soul to you . As to the petites attentions I may have lately shewn one person , and which ſhocked another person so much ye last Evening we were together , I do aſsure you as my friend they are not founded upon any Penchant I might in particular have , but upon an old joke which I explained to you at the time . Alas , my sweetest Friend you are but too well acquainted , I say you are but too well acquainted with the amiable object , on whom my whole love , affection , and esteem centers , upon whom my whole happineſs 2 d . . depends , and for whom I burn with ye . most vivid flame . Let me not say that my paſsion for this amiable object ha d s degenerated , if I instead of love treating her with that violence of paſsion , which I must ever feel , I now treat her with that truly fraternal & tender affection , and that esteem with which it becomes me to treat my dearest and firmest friend . Such my ever amiable friend is the present situation of my heart , search ever y inward corner of it , and look if there is a secret , in the least more interesting which I have not told imparted to you ask any questions of me I am ready prepared to answer every thing concerning which you may poſsibly enquire . When I gave that ever dear kind , & obliging friend a Paper th no t long ago which contained two verses , the verse of the last of which was , je suivrai partout vos liens , I really meant what I said . for had she had not made me a certain promise which I think best not to mention as you well know , my intention really was , not to have survived her loſs a single instant , be it in life or death , je suivrai partout ses liens . Continue 3 d . . my dearest ever amiable and kind friend , to treat me with that open friendship , generosity of heart , and nobleneſs of mind which are innate in you , I conjure you , if not totally to heal , at least to alleviate the pains I fe l e l. Write me an Answer if it is not inconvenient to you , which I entreat of you not to make too short , blame me where I am worthy of it , and commend me where I am worthy of praise . As we are now upon so free and disinterested a conduct , will my ever dearest friend , excuse me if I say ; I think you rather too apt to allow the gloomy ſhades of melancholy , to sieze too ſtrong poſseſsion of you , to let them prey too much upon yr . tender heart , to let them dwell too much in yr . ſpotleſs mind , which lets itself too easily be perceived throughout the whole of yr . delicate frame . Was I to think that I was cause of any part of that melancholy , I would i mm ediately abscond where no one should ever hear of me again , were not I sensible , do I flatter myself , tell me I beseech of you , 4 th . . that it would rather increase than diminish yr . grief to hear that him who was ever , is and ever shall be attached to you , was no more . I very much admire the first Epistle of the Eſsay on man , which which you recommended to me read from ye beginning to ye end over again . I admire the beginning very much , as well as those tender lines concerning which the innocent little lamb , whilst I was reading them , & indeed the whole Epistle , I could not help sighing to think how many great and wonderful bleſsings the Almighty has heaped upon Mankind , & how unworthy we are all of us of them . I have now to add what interests me most , that is my sweetest , dearest , and best of friends , to entreat of you the continuance of that disinterested affection and friendship with which you have treated me all along , and which I shall cher cherish to the end of my life , you will I am sure have generosity enough I am sure I repeat it to grant my request , as you must be sensible than in my situation 5 th . . in life I shall not have many even worldly friends , and not one so open , generous , sympathizing as yourself , which alone must render you dearer to me than the rest of the World together Adieu my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend believe me when I call you tout ce qui m'est chère au monde , these are the never alterable sentiments of him whose greatest happineſs it will be to sign himself throughout ye whole of his life . Yr . ever sincerely affectionate Friend . P.S . I have forgot to make that request I told you I would make to you that is to send me a lock of yr . hair envelopped in yr . answer , with which I will immediately have something made to correspond with + toujours de même I shall keep it in yr . absence as the representative of my dear friend & love it accordingly . write whenever only it is convenient to yourself , & tell me whether you hear that you are to make another sejour at —— soon or not . Excuse my writing & the separate sheets I write upon as I am in an amazing hurry . Adieu pour la seconde fois . + tout ce qui m'est chère au monde . The Carrier of this must call for an answer at what time you settle with him . Adieu encore pour la troisième fois tout ce qui m'est chère au monde .
