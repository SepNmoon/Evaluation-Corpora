S t . James 's Place June 1781 I must my Dear Miſs Hamilton enquire after your health ; it is too preccious for yr Friends not to be interested about it -- you see where I place myself and expect your indulgence . As a fillip to the Spirits is one means of restoring health , I must tell you that the Dſs Dr of Portland is return 'd from Margate entirely to my Satisfaction Then judge how well she is ! I have had many lonely hours in her absence -- & my little enlivener gone too ; and mortified by a dissapointment in an entertainment I was given encouragement to hope for ; no leſs than the Publication of Mr Gilpin s tours with the Drawings ; both so excellent in their way : lost to the Public from the check of Prudence wch . will not allow him to run the hazard of so great an expence I think diffidence and modesty has some share in his reluctance . I wish I cou 'd steal ( for I fear I shall never influence ) out of the mischievous banks at the Gaming Tables 4 or 5 hundred pounds , and bestow it on a work that wou 'd do Honour not only to the very worthy and ingenious author , but to the Country He He lives in . forgive this Lamentation , but you ar e too favourable to Rational entertainments & pleasu res that enlarge , instead of depreſsing the understand ing not only to forgive , but to join in my regret . I am going for some days to quit my little nitch , ( some repairs make it neceſsary ) and go to my never failin g aſsylum at Whitehall : but as her Grace proposes maki ng her visit to Weymouth before she settles at Bulstrod e I shall then bewail my Widdow -hood in my own ho use or at Bill Hill . if you have receiv 'd any comfortable accounts from Lisbon I am sure it will give you pleasure to communicate them . I trust you know without my repeating them how constantly and ardently my wishes hover yo u and your illustrious mansion being with true esteem My Dear Madam Your most Affectionate and most Obliged humble Sert MDelany The Dſs D of Portland desires me to present her affectionate compliments to you . this is a dim day with my Eyes
