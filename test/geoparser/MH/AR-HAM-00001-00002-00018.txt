June 27 -- 89 -- Bath The party to which I was invited consisted only of a Mr . & Mrs Farmer -- sister to Lady Beaumont -- to whom she has a sickly , peevish resemblance -- the Air was so cold , that the walk to Lincom & the Strawberry eating was deferred -- we drank tea with Mrs. Rundell and parted -- 28 . yesterday I sent off a Letter to you -- this morning I did not go out as I found it neceſsary to take Castor Oil -- at 7 I went to Mrs. Hartley 's -- Mrs. Orde came soon after me , & Mrs. Holroyd was prevented from joining us -- I stayed till 9 -- and shd . have left so agreeable , and so uncommon a Woman with extreme reluctanc e if I had not recieved a general invitation to visit her -- She shewed us several beautiful drawings of a Mr. Pocock 's who has taught the young Ladies at Miſs More 's school for 9 Years -- He was originally a captain of a Ship -- & had a naturally a turn for drawing upon receiving proper encouragement from Miſs More s he was induced to prefer drawing Veſsels to navigating them -- he is now going to London -- where his genius will now doubt be rewarded . -- Mrs. Hartley shewed a drawing of her own which She had done for him , as a return for several which he had given to her -- She said , “ he is the humblest of human beings -- , ” that , “ he will take one of Smith s drawings & copy it with infinite pleasure at the same that in her Opinion he far excells him ” , -- She read us two very sensible letters from the younger Cox who is commenced a Travelling Tutor & i s now abroad with a young gentleman -- he describ ed a canton in Swiſserland where the most perfect liberty & harmony reigns amongst the inhabitants . The greatest simplicity of dreſs & manners -- he happened to be at a feast held under the Shade of an immense tree where there was musick & dancing -- the fiddle is not used there -- he said the musick was so plaintive that it had a very powerful Effect both upon him & his pupil -- from wch , he concluded that it must affect the Natives still more ; which no doubt was the reason why the Swiſs are never allowed , ( when ab sent from their own country ) to tune their native strains -- lest it shd . kindle that amor patriae , which has such a wonderful power over their minds -- he related a story wch . I will give you as well as I can recollect -- A woman of fortune in the Canton of Berne at ye age of 76 having conceived a maternal affection for a young Man & wishing to give him her fortune , married him -- she allowed no other connection to take place , but sent for a beautiful young woman to whom She knew the young man was attached -- upon a solemn promise being mutually given between this young couple that they would be lawfully married as soon as She died -- the young Woman was taken into her house , where she lived as the Wife of the young man & bore him 4 Children -- the extreme felicity of this family was interrupted by malice or envy & totally destroyed by an uncommon Instance of Tyranny in the magistrates of ( what is extolled as ) a free State -- The Man , upon the discovery of the connection was compelled to put away the object of his Love which was almost the immediate cause of her death -- The young Man destroyed himself -- The good old Woman died shortly from exceſsive grief & despair and The poor little orphans of this illfated connection were reduced to Beggary == last night we had a sharp frost with Hail Storms -- to day it has snowed twice -- 29 . I called upon Mrs. Holroyd , whom I found in her drawing room where she has got a picture of Ld . Sheffield by Sir Joshua Reynolds , which was really a treat to me -- for I never saw a picture of any Master 's yt pleased me more -- how happy I shd . be to have such a picture of the dear Object of my Love -- I believe votre mari has been a little nervous lately -- for I never felt so uncomfortable at being separated from you before You are every instant before my Eyes -- I wish for you every moment & am really unhappy to be without you -- I sincerely hope Nothing will ever happen to remove me again to so great a distance from every thing that is dear to me in this world & I hope the advantages that I shall derive from my sejour at this place , will compensate to you for my Absence -- I staid u p an hour with Mrs. Holroyd -- at 6 I went to Mrs. Orde 's & staid an hour & half with her -- ( She goes tomorrow to Sandleford ) -- and then went to Miſs Milnes -- Mr . & Mrs. Vanbrugh , all alive , were there -- Miſs Nicolls -- Mrs. Meynell , Mrs . & Miſs Isted , who reproached me for not havg called upon them -- The younger Mr. Isted , a sweet creature , Miſs Milnes younger Brother & about a dozen Card players who 's names I did not enquire , except one , who at the first glymse , has a likneſs of my dear Lady De Veſsie -- Miſs Milnes gave me a friendly invitation to dine there on Wednesday quite en famille -- She says She loves reasonable people , who are great curiosities at Bath , & begs you will come here in the Winter -- Mr. M . told me that a day or t w o ago he went upon the top of Gloucester Cathedrall to see the dismal sight of all the low lands in that Country & in Worcestershire deluged with Water to an amazing extent -- one gentleman at Tewksbury has had a 1000£ worth of Hay destroyed & the loſs to the whole country will be immense -- Mrs . & Miſs Isted came away when I did -- I attended the old Lady home & then ing Miſs took my Arm & I walked with her to Mrs. Bowdler 's where She was to sup -- I desired her to make enquiries about Miſs Foster -- She returned to me in the paſsage with a melancholy Acct . indeed -- “ that Miſs Foster by the last Acct . was speechleſs & the faculty had pronounced that her death must happen in a Week ” -- This I fear will overset our Friend / -- 30 -- After my Leſsons I took up that infamous paper The Herald in which was a most scandalous allusion to our worthy King , under the title of Insanity -- & a paragraph mentioned that Marchesi had been uncommonly noticed by Miſs Hamilton , & it was wonderful what means he could have made use of to gain such influence over the fair -- I had promised S. Nicolls to drink tea with her this afternoon -- about 5 OClock . I recd . a Note from her to say that She had just recd . a Letter , whh- wd . hasten her departure from Bath -- & cd . not see me -- suspecting what was really the truth , that my services wd . be absolutely neceſsary to her , I posted away directly & found her in great confusion with all her things about her & Mrs. Hocker giving every aſsistance -- Mrs- H . could not stay & I was obliged to pack up most of Sally 's Matters -- This diverted me exceſsively , for Sally 's Maid is a stiff Methodist & I believe thoug ht it an Abomination that a Man shd . to uch any part of a Womans dreſs I repeatedly called for her Smickets . but I cd . hardly create a smile Sally was pleased as neither She or her maid could have got half the Clothes into a Trunk , which She did not buy till the last moment , I left them to cram their odd matters as well as they cd . after I had secured her Laces & best things properly -- like a great Simpleton She had got no money but in Bath bank bills -- which wd . have been of no use to her any where else -- & the Banks were shut -- I gave her change for two & with some trouble got the rest converted into Cash -- thō She was to go the next morning She never thought of securing places in the Coach , which I was obliged to you -- in short I had a great deal of running about for this crazy Creature and was quite tired July 1 st . This morning I did not wake as soon as I wished , for thō I made all the haste that I could , Sally was off about a ¼ of an hour before I got t o the Inn -- which vexed me as I had promised to see her before She set out -- Ingles called upon me at 9 -- at one I called upon him & we walked about The town for an hour -- I bathed last night in the corporation Baths which are very pleasant . thō more expensive for the Weather is too cold to bathe in the morning -- I went to Bed immediately -- & a profuse perspiration came on wh . continued for a considerable , wch . I rather encouraged as I have had pains in my limbs since the former bathing , wch . I attribute to the coldneſs of the Atmosphere at that tim e I din ed at Mrs. Milnes 's there was only one Lady , as the young Man had taken one of flights & I believe is gone to Sweden . I spent a very pleasant afternoon -- Miſs M . told me that Ld . Bolingbroke was gone off with his half Sister & that Ld . Herbert had pursued them to Norwich -- I left the Milnes 's at 8 & went to Ingles with whom I stayed an hour -- Mrs . I . was gone with a Lady to a Cardparty -- / 2 . / This morng Ingles called upon me by Appointment , & we walked round Bath , as he wished to see the New Buildings -- & in the course of it made two or three proposals of Excursions , to all which I stated objections , however I at last consented to go with him some where to day , which goes against the grain , as I lose a Leſson upon the Violincello , which I regret , as I 'm anxious to get all the information I can , as there are so many more difficulties on that instrument than on a piano forte -- I am in momentary expectation of seeing Ingles & am writing as fast as I can that I may send this off to day -- I have got a ridiculous Idea in my head , which is , that a certain person ( whose ideas of things differ from ours upon most subjects ) will make a proposal to you of taking a trip into Lancashire whilst I am out of the Way -- to this I have always had insuperable Objections , which still remain . I must tell you , that every Body compliments me upon the Improvement of my Looks -- it is very lucky that Bath is so thin of Company or I shd . make sad Havoc with the young Hearts as my Beauty would be irresistable -- I am very well and in charming Spirits thank God , for the last day or two -- Write to me my dearest Girl soon , for I 'm impatient to hear from you & of f you . my dear Louisa & c & c Isaac is just come from Ingles -- hang him -- I must go. , adieu , adieu a thousand good wishes attend you all -- I am most Affy . Yr . J. D . 2 d . we have a tolerable fine day -- a great deal of rain yesterday Adieu -- God bless my Love & our dear li t tle Darling -- Kiſses 100. for Louisa from Papa Mrs Dickenson -- Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire X Post .
