Thursd 1779 Friday My dearest , my dearest , my dearest Friend , You answer in every particular and are worthy that sacred appellation , you shew that notwithstanding yr . affection for m y e as a Man , yet you pay true regard to my Character , yr views & affection , an d esteem for me extend beyond the Grave . I was resolved my dearest Friend however short my Letter might be , to write to you , in order to pour forth into yr . bosom ye . overflowings of a truely grateful heart . such are mine , proceeding from ye . disinterested , tender , generous expressions in yr . last dear Note . Adieu Adieu , Adieu my friend , may you enjoy all ye . bleſsings this World can afford , & may you live , at last to crown the happineſs of Yr . Palemon . toujours de même P.S . I admired ye . Verses you sent me very much , I will follow their advice with ye great neſs eſt attention . I co ſu bjoin another copy , with which I ſuppose you are already acquainted , I do not send ym .. for ye . beauty , but for ye sentiments , which I hope expreſs both ours . This last bleſsed Note of yrs . has made me happier than words can expreſs . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu once more my Guardian Angel , toujours de même “ I can not send you ye character , nor take notice of any of yr . former Letters till my return . I ſhall continue “ ye same civil conduct according to yr . advice to W. R . during my Stay . Second Song out of ye Poem of Constantia & Philetus by Cowley . 1 Time ! fly with greater speed away Add feathers to thy wings , Till thy haste in flying brings That wisht-for & expected day . 2 d . . Comforts , Sun ! we then shall see , Tho ugh ' at first it darken 'd be With dangers ; yet , those Clouds but gone , Our day will put his lustre on . 3 d . . Then tho ugh ' death 's sad Night appear , And we in lonely silence rest ; Our ravish e ' d Souls no more shall fear ; But with lasting day be blest . 4 . And then no friends can part us more , Nor no new death extend its power ; Thus there 's nothing can diſsever Hearts which love has joined together . Abraham Cowley , 'Constantia 's Song ' , from Constantia and Philetus , 1633 . Substitute friendship in ye place of that word for yrself , tho ' it does not make verse , & let both vye for me . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu . toujours chère .
