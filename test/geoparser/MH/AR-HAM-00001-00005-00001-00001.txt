Wolverton Septr 18 1807 Dear Mrs Dickenson It will gave me the greatest pleasure to accept of your kind Invitation & to have the pleasure of waiting on you the 15 th of next month . Mrs Cathcart is equally obliged to you for your attention in thinking of her but she finds it eſsential situated at no great distance from many Friends to keep invariably the resolution of not sleeping from home . Many thanks for your kind congratulations , tho I never doubted my Dearest Brother would do justice to the confidence reposed in him yet I am in the highest degree elated that he has terminated the difficult busineſs alotted to him with a hand so masterly that History will perpetuate the recollection of it . My Sister of course can feel no ailment at this moment , she has not been quite well lately however . I have not heard one word of our good Friend since he left us but I seldom hear from him regularly . I am always so glad when I meet with any one who knows him . Mrs Cathcart joins me in best regards to yourself Mr & Miſs Dickenson & I remain most Affectly Yrs AH Cathcart Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzard Beds
