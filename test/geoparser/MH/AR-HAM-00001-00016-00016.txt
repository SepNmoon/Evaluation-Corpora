Dover St- My dearest Friend , I have at last stolen half an Hour to write to you , and had I been the Regulator of my own time , you should have heard from me several often before now , but I have been so taken up of late that it has made it utterly impoſsible . I just now sat down with a stedfast Resolution to scl scold , and and bluster a little , but the attempt is vain , and I find my Heart open only to softer emotions . How can you be so cruel as to stay in the Country from us 3 Weeks. ! If you did but know the mortification I receive by your absence I am sure you would pity me ; perhaps -- but I will curb that presumptuous thought , and not suffer myself to be hurried away by it . I think I never experienced more pleasure than when I heard we were to remain in London till Christmas ; but how was that all overset , when a few Hours afterwards I learned by a Letter you wrote Miſs Gunning , that you was to remain at town . I wish the Dutcheſs would content herself with her shells and foſsils , and not monopolize my dear Friend ; but I believe I am only blameing in her what I should be happy to do myself had I it in my Power . If you have any Love , pity , or compaſsion for me , pray return soon , and if you leave pleasanter scenes than what you come to , you will have at least this Consolation , that you bring happineſs to many I dare say , and I am sure I can answer for one . But since you have been so kind as to say that you take some little interest in me , I will pro proceed to inform you of some of my Proceedings since you left us . I have spent my time very agreeably , I would say happily was I but bleſsed with your company . My me mornings are spent as usual in Study , and as I have my Mare in Bulstrode I employ the time from about 2 o clock till 3½ in riding in Hyde Park , where I have generally the pleasure of meeting the Prince of Wales , who is as constant as I am . I have Spent most of my Evenings after Tea from Home . So there is a short stretch of my day , every Hour of which I have considered as lost time , since I am deprived of the Company of her whose society I count above every thing else . I have never once been able to bring myself to call on Miſs Clark tho ' I have often intended it . I can not go near your House till you return . I have forgot to tell you that Mr. C—— and I have got very comfortable Apartments in our new Mansion , having a very good Room on the ground Floor for our Studies , and 2 exceeding good Bed chambers above , in short we have by far the best part of the House . I heard of your your Welfare , the other Evening from Mrs Boscawen who had just left you , and I met W Hamilton the other day in the Town tho I recollect him till I had paſsed him , if I had I would certainly have spoke to him , and requested him to fetch he you away from City . My Pen is not able to convey the Sentiments of my Heart , but I hope by this time you are not a perfect stranger to them , yet I can not help aſsuring you that there is nobody that I have so sincere a Love and Respect for , and which I hope I shall for ever shew in all my Actions . Time will not permit me to say more , and I must reluctantly conclude . Adieu . most amiable of Women and believe me to be your most sincere & affectionate Friend -- I am afraid that you can not read this , as it is wrote in such haste , but I would not let slip the opportunity tho I had so little time I shall entreat you to answer this in Person ; How grieved I was I could not call upon you the Morning you went it was impoſsible , do not think it was any neglect , for I wanted much to see you and speak with you . I now look forward to nothing but Scenes of happineſs , do not you destroy them all . I envy every Body who I see with those they most Love and think how different is my Lot . Mr C . and Mr A—— L—— D—— L—— W . for instance I am going to attend Mr. Walker s Philosophical Lectures from I hope to receive much pleasure , would you were of the party . I shall not expect an answer from to this , but I hope to see you in a few days ; pray send me word thro ' some Channel when I am may expect you . I could write forever would my time & Paper last -- You must excuse the form of the Letter for convenience . Miſs Hamilton -- at the Dutcheſs of Portland s Bulstrode Park Gerards Croſs . Bulstrode
