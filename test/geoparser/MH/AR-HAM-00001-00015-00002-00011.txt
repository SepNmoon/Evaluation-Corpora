August 27 th . 1780 Sunday Night 12 oClock It has not been in my power my dearest and amiable friend to find a comfortable leisure hour to hold sweet converse with you since last Monday two post days without writing , -- what a long silence ! -- I have had the delight each day to receive some lines from you -- shall employ this hour of silence to answer yours -- & shall borrow from the night to talk with my Astrea . I have laid before me those dear letters of yours wch- are unanswered & shall proceed regularly to answer wt . I find neceſsary , to avoid mistake & omiſsion . The Xtening will not be at Babel for Rhea wrote to tell Perfecta it wd . Louvre , & I hear ye . child will be Xtened at five weeks old on that account -- so you may not expect to see me till the 5 th . Week after ye . Birth of ye . Child , and yt . event you know must remain rather uncertain -- she expects I believe in ye . first week of September . I was much entertain 'd by the account of ye . Sack-race -- & wish 'd myself with you in the Barnes Garden -- I long to see your Han̅overian Hanoverian Lady , perhaps I shall this Winter -- but I charge you do not let me find a rival in her -- I own I am with respect to you very selfish , & you have made me discover that I have jealousy in my composition . Lady M. H . & her daughter were pleased wth . your remembrance of them & desired their Compts . to you . they went away last Thursday -- I found them such as you describe -- On Wednesday Tuesday there was a little Ball made up for them by some Nephews and Neices of Lady M H . Dr Bajott of Christ Church who is the Husband of one of them has a living at Jevington about 4 miles from hence where he resides abt . two or 3 months a year -- ( he is a man of very superior abilities and character ) -- Mrs. Bajott having two Brothers & Sisters w th . her , & engaging two or 3 other families to join , made up a pretty little dance -- I was invited but as I was apprehensive of heating myself I declin 'd going -- I did go however , for as Ldy . M. H . call 'd for Perfecta abt . 10 oClock just to look in upon the dancers I went with ym . , & then was prevail 'd upon to join the dance & staid till ½ past one in ye . Morng . -- I was amused , the people were good humour 'd , & I did not suffer for this diſsipation ; On Wednesday the H . came pour prendre longe t -- Caled lent M . H . & me his Post Chaise & we went to Jevington -- Mrs. B . having civily preſs 'd me to come , knowing I cd . not receive her visit at Pſs . E house . we found ym . at tea & staid abt . ½ an hour Mrs. B . appears good humour 'd but is not well much polish 'd -- the same her sisters -- I was sorry not to be able to enter more into conversation wth . ye . D r - I was pleased wth . his manner , & his countenance is interesting -- his person has quite the appearance of a studious man -- at least such as one often fancies studious Men must have -- so thin so very thin is Dr. B . that he appears the Shadow of a Shadow . during our drive M. H . conversed a good deal -- but I was obliged to lead on from one thing to another to keep up the conversation -- I feel a kindneſs for her -- she is so gentle & unpresuming -- & then she in a very pretty manner told me she should regret having known me if she might not hope to continue the acquaintance in Town & c & c I am more astonished than I can expreſs at insolence -- How mean to take privilege of her sex to say such rude & groſs things -- what could have provoked her to attack Benedict -- for of all the men I ever met with I never knew one more delicate or more attentive in his manner & conversation ; to be able therefore to say rude things to him must require no common share of effrontery . what are the Subjects of ye . Books Edwin has sent you ? I am at length free 'd from his correspondence -- for I have not had a letter for some time -- I did not answer two or three terrible long ones he wrote me last month -- I suppose you intend to follow my example I am now got to yours of the 20 th .- Caled received your Compts . with pleasure & I managed so well , that an answer , otherwise than through me was not neceſsary -- give my grateful thanks to Benedict & tell him I shall ask him for three Guineas when I see him -- I have the comfort of telling you that a very considerable subscription has been raised for the poor Widow ; more of this when we meet , -- Ah when will that be ! I think I hear you exclaim . -- Do not from what I have said judge too unfavorable of Caled -- he is not I beleive so amiable as I thought him -- nor do I think him a proper person for the place he fills -- he will do very well to live in the World , & has liv 'd much in it -- he is acquainted wth . the tricks of ye . World wch . often makes him advance illiberal notions & c. & c Hamet & Omar I am fully persuaded are most estimable characters -- I know rather more of the former , as he has , in our rides opened himself to me with all the candour & confidence of friendship . You make me tremble my Astrea -- I do not like the account you send me of the state of your mind -- Oh beware of endulging yourself to think over past events -- for surely my Love to that only you could allude -- “ pity you ” -- yes I do from my Soul -- how could you -- how could my friend imagine I ever should “ despise ” her -- my God how could you write the word -- do I not know & feel that my Astrea s mind is superior -- she never can act wrong -- she may indeed feel too much -- you have charg 'd me not to alarm myself -- I will not -- but then I conjure you keep me not in ignorance in any thing relative to you -- you have indeed promised me you will not , & I depend upon your promises . You say “ tell me that you love me ” ; esteem me ” -- could you see into my Heart you wld- see how I lov 'd -- & , I must esteem where I greatly love . Thank God You are better in Health . -- 't is impoſsible for me to tell you w h ether I shall be at Babel or Leuctra at my return . Yours of the 24 th . is apparently apparently written in great agitation of spirits -- Benedict s indisposition will certainly increase your complaints -- I hope to receive better accounts of him tomorrow -- how could you be so indiscreet to heat yourself by walking -- surely there could be no occasion so preſsing to oblige You to walk in August in Town -- I am glad you are going to drink the Bath waters they always stand your friend . -- let me know if they agree equally well with you as formerly . -- Monday Morng . 28 th . I had intended telling You of a little excursion we took on Friday but I must postpone it till next post -- Yours of Satry . is just come -- my fears are realliz 'd -- Your letter has dejected me beyond expreſsion -- yet I thank you for it . let me hear next post -- fail not , for you know wt . I shall suffer if I am kept in suspence -- God Almighty protect you & restore Health to Benedict & Yourself -- Adieu my friend my Astrea -- I have not time for more Adieu Miranda Lady Charlotte Finch desires you will accept her best Compts . shd . be obliged if you wd . send the inclosed for her -- 27 th August 1780
