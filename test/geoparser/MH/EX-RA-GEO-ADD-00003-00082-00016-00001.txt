My dearest dearest dearest friend , I have now but a moment , therefore I will say what little I can to you now the rest must be deferred till 5 o clock tomorrow Morning . I have not forgot the situation Providence has placed me in , I can not help however help lamenting that I am of such rank as to prevent at least for ye present , my being united to her , whom alone I can love . I should look upon myself as the most execrable wretch upon ye face of ye Earth , if I was wanting in ye smallest tittle to ye best of Parents , I would not be ye cause of a moment 's un happineſs to them for all the Earth poſseſses . Impetuosity , ardor , no word is too ſtrong for my present sentiments . I see Beauty Person , accomplishments , every thing in ſhort in you that could make my life happy . But after tomorrow I will forever close my lips upon that subject whatever my feelings may be as it seems to be disagreable to you . Disgraceful t d o you call it for me to feel such sentiments for you , I look upon it as ye glory of my life . I conjure you by all that 's sacred to explain yrself what you mean when you say whatever appearance things may carry with them , or however affairs may turn out you will act up to ye character of my friend . ever dear ever precious name . You drive me to distraction , think not I conjure you of ever going , if you do at present , you will drive me notwithstanding all ye . strong principles of Religion I have had instilled into me , from my earliest Childhood , to commit some horrid attempt upon myself , if hereafter you go & retire abroad I will leave my Country , Parents , family in short every thing that ought to be dear to me on Earth , merely to follow you in order to have ye happineſs of seeing her to whom I am so firmly attached . But after tomorrow I again declare , I will never for ye . future open my lips to you upon that subject . Excuse I entreat of you the violence of my terms , it is upon a so much a subject too much connected with my happineſs for m y e to speak otherwise upon it . You will ever be my friend , & I hope you never will find any reason to think me otherwise than yrs . Adieu My dearest , dearest , dearest Friend . P.S . Excuse my writing for I am in prodigious hast , as well as ye stile .
