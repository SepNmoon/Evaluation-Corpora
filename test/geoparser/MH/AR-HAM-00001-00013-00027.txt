15 th . Decbr 1785 Albemarle Str London My dearest Mrs .. Dickenson Your kind letter to my dearest Mother made us both weep , how soothing & affectionate ; indeed our loſs is irreparable , but when we reflect on his character & many virtues , & know that he is happier than this world ever made him , it rather reconciles one the better to his loſs , he bore his long & tedious illneſs with the greatest fortitude & resignation , & I have reason to think , that he had for a length of time apprehended himself in danger , & Docr : Brocklesby & Mr Devaynes both thought so , o O wing to the laudanum which he took , his senses quite forsook him for three weeks before he died , he seldom knew my mother or me , the Friday fortnight before we loſs't him he came to his senses for two hours , knowing that you will be interrested to know what paſs 'd I will copy a written paper which I have in my pocket book & which I wrote down half an hour after he said it . “ On Friday the 11 th .. of Novr : my dearest Father who had been rather delirious “ for Some days , on this day awoke , sitting in his chair , out of a good “ sleep , with my mother sitting by him ; in great diſtreſs calling for his “ child , ( meaning me ) I went to him , he look 'd at me in tears , grasp 'd my “ hand , & said my own my dearest child , he addreſs 'd himself to Virtue , & said “ Oh virtue virtue , God can only say who is truly virtuous , he had always “ walkd in her paths , & said to me , live my sweet child & be the admiration “ of the world . -- After a pause he addreſs 'd himself to my mother “ & told her he had ever reason to approve of her conduct , that she had “ always been the same from the first day he knew her to that “ hour . -- He spoke of truth , & calld on God & looking “ upwards , with his hands clasp 'd , said he should meet his maker “ face to face . He ask 'd my mother whether she had ever mistrusted ” him , she asur 'd him she had not , he said he had done justice “ to every one , even to those that had injured him ; After this he “ was very composed & desired no one might be permitted to come “ into the room but his son coming in rather abruptly he “ said Richd . , Richd .. , you are come to complain ; his son ask 'd him “ to explain himself , he answer 'd you know my mind has been “ in a state of great perterbation , but if he wish 'd him to “ explain himself , he had spoke from his feeling ; Richd .. left “ the room , & he was my Dr . Father went to bed ; from that day “ his faculties quite forsook him . -- You my dearest friend will weep as you read the above , but you can have no Idea , of what a scene it was to us , his countenance , his tears , & his words are deeply engrav 'd on my heart , once he said “ he should have a few womens tears , but it must be so . ” The dear Anna Maria was the greatest comfort to us , by her constant & kind attention . -- He has provided amply for Richd .. , & left him his library , which he has already disposed , I fear he is very much in debt ; I am miſstress of six thousand pounds , & what is far more valuable to me , than money , are his manuscripts , that is to me , the greatest proof to me of his affection ; my excellent mother is amply provided for , & I trust that she will have £800 a year , every thing at her own disposal the plate excepted which is only hers for life , & then goes to Richard . I have mention 'd £800 a year , but perhaps when every thing is settl 'd it may be more . I believe Richd .. comes in for £11.000 , but his behaviour during the whole time of my dearest Father 's illneſs was very faulty , I may almost say shocking . Pray give my most affectionate love to Mr Dickenson , & tell him how much we were flatter 'd by his kind expreſsions of esteem for us . I remain my dearest Mrs. Dickenson your sincere & Affectionate friend Mary Glover . P.S . my Father has left Mrs .. Lenton £200 .. she desires her best Compts . I am now with our dearest Anna Maria , who is very busy putting up some books , she looks remarkably well , & is well ; She desires he best love to you & Mr. D—— Mrs .. Dickenson
