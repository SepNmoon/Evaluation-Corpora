Bath 1789 -- N o . 18 Queen 's Square 15 July -- I was mortified to find that my Letter was five minutes too late for the post -- writing brought on a Headach wch kept me at home all day -- I believe playing , writg & c is not very proper for me as a Water Drink -- but my time is short & I am anxious to make the most of it & to return to the Arms of my affectionate & amiable Wife -- 16 / I bathed last night -- this morning I called upon Mrs. Rundell -- & in the afternoon went with the Major , Mr . & Mrs. Davies & the two eldest girls to Mrs. Simpson 's to drink Tea -- we had a great deal of Rain in the course of the day -- 17 / I sat half an hour with Mrs. Holroyd -- She gave me an Acct . of a Visit she made to Madam Schwellenbergen -- of the Queen 's sending for her into her dreſsing Room & of her graciousness -- of the same from the eldest Princesses & her being obliged to stay to see the young Whelps & c & c -- I spent a great part of this day in conversation with the Major -- who breaks into my plan -- but he makes ample amends by communicating to me his knowledge of human Nature -- I always leave him in Spirits -- we expect his Brother Sir David who is in the Navy -- the Major describes him to me , as a Man of an excellent Understanding , but haughty & impetuous -- brave & too proud to bow to those in power -- without a single Air he feels all the original consequence of his family & his Blood boils almost to madneſs , to see persons of mean Birth & Talents raised over his head -- merely from their suppleness -- the Major says his mind is jaundic 'd -- by repeated disappointments , which his pride & intolerable ha u teur have brought upon him -- this morning was fine -- but the whole afternoon rainy -- 18 / In our morning 's walk I met the Vanbrugh 's who desired me to drink Tea with them if I was not more agreeably engaged -- the morning was spent in Italian , Singing & Musick -- I have got La belle Catherine for Eliza & Herschell has set a Base to it for me -- Herschell has proposed to let me have an old Violono . of his for 4-4-0 which is as good as I cd . probably get for twice the money or much more in buying a new one + I have not resolved what to do as this great Evil gallops out of my pocket at an amazing rate not withstanding all my care & grumblings -- Some part I lay to your charge -- at 7 I went to the Vanbrughs -- there were some Card players there -- at 8 I went away & intended to go to Mrs. Hartley 's -- in the way I saw Mrs. Rundell -- who made Enquiries after you & asked about the Letter I had recd- upon my expreſsg an anxiety to hear from you , she mentioned a Letter had been brot to her that morng & she desired the post to deliver it himself concludg that he went to that part of the town -- I immediately went to the office & the person , in who 's division we happen to be , told me , that he had just delivered the Letter to Mr. Davies -- Away I posted to my Lodgings -- but no Mr. Davies -- no letter -- he was gone out -- so I turned about & walked gravely to Mrs. Hartley 's -- I found her alone & as ever very pleasant -- we talked a great deal about the present dreadful situation of France & she desired me to read to her a petition & summation which their ( long ) parliament sent to the King , you will certainly have it in your papers , therefore I shall only say that it shews , the Spirit of the people & that their own terms must be complied with -- but not witht an horrible effusion of Blood -- Mrs. H . preſsed me to stay & eat my Supper wt- her I excused my self as I meant to go into the Bath & was anxious to meet with your L -- at ½ past 9 I came home & had ye- pleasure of finding yours of the 15 th -- what a charming Trait you give me of our Dear Louisa -- God grant that she may continue to be like her Mother & tread in all her Virtuous Steps -- what a bleſsing may she be to us , if it shd . please God to spare our Lives -- She may be the delight & comfort of our declining years -- or it may be agreeable to the divine Will to bereave us of our Darling -- but I will not indulge melancholy thoughts -- and but endeavour to be as thankful as I ought to be for the great bleſsings I enjoy -- I propose to return to you about the third of August -- be so good as to let me know if the Coach comes by Taxal , this way , on the same days that it did when I came here -- it vexes me to find that I must be 3 days on the road -- I wrote to day to Miſs More to say that if will be agreeable to them I will pay them a visit on Saturday next -- my plan is to go on friday after drinking the Waters to Lady Fust s -- I shall spend an hour or two with Dr. Stonehouse in my way -- & on Saturday I shall go to Cowslip green & return here on Tuesday Evg -- by this plan I shall omit only two days drinking the waters & 2 leſsons -- unfortunately Rauzzini is engaged to superintend the musick meeting at Wells , so that I can only see him very seldom -- you must remember that he can not give notes -- & I have very few -- my modesty flies to my cheeks every time that I see him , & I feel quite ashamed to make an attempt that can never succeed -- what a naughty creature you are -- this has been a lovely day indeed -- /19 / This morning Mrs. Rundell sent her Son to enquire about ye- Letter & to offer me a seat in the Octagon Chapel to hear a celebrated preacher -- he gave us a very good sermon , wch was delivered in a manner far above mediocrity -- he has a very good harmonious Voice , which he manages tolerably well , but he sometimes falls into a common error of laying his emphasis upon the verb or adjective in a sentence when the substantive gives the sense -- it is a pity but there were Schools and Colleges set apart for the Education of Clergymen only , when a quiet pronunciation of our own Language & a thorough knowledge of the Scriptures should be chiefly attended to -- a man can not read finely without a good Ear & an harmonious voice to which may be added a reasonable degree of vanity , as a stimulus -- I am disgusted with every species of affectation -- & as there appeared some in ye- Preacher which caused my risibility , I returned disappointed -- Major M . speaking of Clergymen mentioned an Anecdote of Dr. Duncan of Flamborough in hampshire -- a man universally beloved by his parish which contains 1800 people & as a proof of this attachment to him they voluntarily raised his Income upwards of an hundred pounds a year -- at the time the Major alluded to , the Season was very like this -- the D r . told his Congregation that they would do a n injury to the wise dispensations of providence if they could su ppose that the great Creator of the Universe could be displeased wi th them for endeavouring to secure that harvest which out of his gr eat goodneſs he had provided for them -- that the restraints on the Sabbath were of a very different nature -- he told them that if the next sunday appeared , from his observations , to be favourable , a bell shd . be rung for them to go to work , & the first wet day shd . be kept as a Sunday -- accordingly on the Sunday morning at 5 o'Clock a bell was rung , when all the farmers attended to their harvest & on wednesday morng another Bell gave them notice to offer up their prayers at Church , which I dare say they would do more fervently than they had ever done before -- the Bell rings for dinner , & I must obey the summons -- adieu for the present mia cara sposa , sono vostro sposo affezionato -- 20/ as soon as I could get up from table yesterday I went to meet a Lady & walked in a very pleas an t Grove with her -- what think you of these assignations -- I c a n't tell you Who the Lady is -- but I can say that She is one of the most agreeable women I ever met with -- here I met a Mr. Serres a painter & had a great deal of conversation with him -- he told me that Ld . Warwick copies Vandervelt so exactly that he defies any Man , who has not made his Stile of painting his particular study , to discover the Copy -- this S—— is a pleasant Creature & it is from his Son that I am to have a few leſsons -- if I could only acquire a few tecknical terms it wd . be an advantage -- for people who can make a tolerable use of them ( not say bravura for peano -- Lord what a creature that is ) have often more credit given to them for taste & judgement than they are entitled to -- We had a delightful day yesterday & this is a charming morning -- I must reaſsume the sc h oolboy with my Satchel over my shoulder -- adieu again for an hour or two -- ½ past 2 I am just returned from my drawing Master who said he never had a Scholar that improved so much in the first Leſson -- I have only a few minutes to spare before this must go to the post office to acknowledge the Recet of a most kind & afft Letter wch . I found here from my Father pray give my Love to him & ease his Fears about my Health to be sure when I wrote to you , I found myself very uncomfortable , but I make no doubt but I shall return to you in perfect health -- Adieu my dearest & best friend -- I love you most affy .
