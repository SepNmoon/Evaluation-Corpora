Mr. Frederick Hamilton Turin Sepr . 1764 My Dear Brother will be surpriz 'd , not to have heard from me long before this time , & perhaps still more when he sees from whence I date my letter ; the case is plainly this , when I came to consult with Charles , who behaved to me as well as I cou 'd possibly wish , in what part of France to fix my residence , after having absolutely objected against Aix or Marseille the former for being a dear place & crowded with English , the latter for being disagreeable , we then thought Thoulouse might answer my purpose till we also started strong objections against that place ; in short as she perceiv 'd that my inclination was for Italy , she advised me to go there without further ceremony , as I shou 'd then be at a certainty of fixing in a place perfectly agreeable to me & not liable to the trouble of moving from one place to another ; as for what people might say , it was of no consequence , as it is as usual to go into Italy on account of one 's health as to any part of France ; she gave me her opinion upon this matter with so much sincerity & affection , & as it agreed so perfectly with my inclination I loſsd no time o i n proceeding on my journey & am now thus far on my way to Florence , where I hope to be agreeably settled & at no great expence Lady Warwick Badioli 's upper Servant , who is a Florentin and an extraordinary clever fellow has wrote to a relation of his at Florence who he aſsures me will fix me there to my mind . I am to find good Appartments ready for me & two Servants a Man & a maid ; with this small appointment I think I can go on upon my plan without any danger of exceeding . We have had a long , troubblesone & expensive journey Lady Warwick is much fatigued & has caught a violent cold by being exposed to a heavy rain on our paſsage over Mont Cenis . We expect to arrive at Florence in eight days more , we go very slow as we go by Voiture . I shall defer writing to you again till I have been at least a fortnight at the place of my destination that I may be able to give you a full & explicit account of every thing you may be desirous of knowing . Adieu my Dear Brother present my most affectionate Compts . with my Wife 's to Mrs. Hamilton & Mrs. Hamilton & remember us to our poor Child I am & shall ever remain most faithfully & Affectionately Yours Mary Turin September 19 th . 1764 direct to me Gentilhomme Anglois à Florence
