My dearest , I thank you for your note and little journal -- your time seems to be as compleatly employed and taken up as mine tho ' rather more agreeably -- How can you name Thursday & Friday two of the Days on which I always must be engaged -- I know not when we shall meet as you are so all this Week -- will you dine with us on Monday ? & stay till ¼ after 7 when I go to the Queen 's House -- pray do -- I am very sorry that the Busineſs on which Mr D . was to come to Town is not forward enough for him -- I am out of patience with this foolish Estate -- adieu my dear , I have a violent headache today which I am going to carry to & increase at the Drawingrooms & Play . yours & c CMG --
