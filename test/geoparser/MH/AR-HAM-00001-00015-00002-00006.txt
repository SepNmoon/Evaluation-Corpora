June 24 th . 1780 East Bourne Suſsex I must my Astrea beg leave to wave the ungrateful subject , of I can not mak ing e comments upon the conduct of people from whom I receive civilities , & with whom I live in friendship -- I had rather be a dupe than condemn without having sure grounds for objection -- yet do not imagine I can approve the wrong -- or reject the right -- but I suffer always so exquisitely from finding myself deceived in a * Lady S—— character that I dread when once I have form 'd a good opinion , to find I have err 'd in judg e ment . -- do not my Dear friend get into a habit of listening & giving credit to common report -- Lord Stormont s inattention at any other time wd . deserve the severe epithets of my Astrea makes use of -- viz . arrogance -- inhumanity -- pride & insolence -- a few moments reflection upon the distrest state of his mind both on his Uncle s & his own account ought besides the situation of public affairs wch- as a Minister he was deeply interested in , -- ought to make one more charitable . -- notwithstanding I do not hold his Lordship excused , for it wd . have been most natural to have treated wth . hospitality those to whom he owed protection -- I hope therefore this has been falsely represented . -- What would I not give to have you here -- the environs are charming -- every day we take different airings & are more & more delighted with the country -- You wd . be pleased too with our stile of life , & our little society is just what we could wish -- you know Mr. Bruyeres , -- you would be equally pleas 'd wth . Mr. Farhill & Mr. Fisher -- their manner and conversation is perfectly to my taste -- when I have seen more of ym . I will endeavour to give You their char ac ters -- nothing affords one a better opportunity than living with people in a domestic way . Lady C Finch desires her Compts- to you -- she is quite well & in better spirits than I have seen her in for some time . she is quite like a parent to me . -- why did you tell me you were going to Petersham -- yet why should I regret it -- that place will recall me oftener to your mind -- you will remember the little excursions you took last year to Kew -- you will remember that ye . first mark of your confidence -- the strict tie of our friendship takes its date from that time & place . -- Pray tell Sir R . that I hope never to lose his good opinion -- & that I am sensibly pleased with his expreſsions in my favor -- my love to Bell -- Adieu my Dear Dear friend -- I am happy you are so well -- get franks & send me some for you . I shall write again on Monday -- my Compts . to Mrs. Walshingham . Adieu Adieu June 24 th 1780
