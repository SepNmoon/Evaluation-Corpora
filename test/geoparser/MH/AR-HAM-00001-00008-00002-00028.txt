Audley End Saffron Walden Eſsex Febry 5 th - My dear Mrs Dickenson I beg to know how you all do -- & most particulary do I long to hear that the dear Lou : is now feeling recover 'd -- not long ago Mrs de Salis mention 'd having read a very kind letter from you -- wherein you mention state , that yr dear Child was all but well . she had been near well very often , but you could not pronounce her to be quite so -- these longings of mine cd have been sooner made known but for a variety of circumstances , viz I chose to relapse at the return of the hard frost . this vex 'd me . I was obliged to have recourse to Medicine & dine up Stairs , & recover 'd very Stupid . The next Thing which happen 'd was the death of our Aunt Blosset . whom I never saw -- & alth ' o she left me did not leave us any of her Property , yet as She lived & died in a House of ours in Dublin . & the Lease was out -- we have been much occupied in writing to each other , as her death & my orders to our Agent has occasion 'd our making a discovery not very favorable to those who were formerly Employ 'd by us -- or you wd actively wonder what could occupy these Sisters , in the Selling of a House 2 of them never saw -- but I love to investigate very deeply -- & I was therefore obliged to write to constrain them from being too open , besides all this -- when the Weather is fine we go out in the Whisky -- & after our return , I am too apt to Goſsip with my ing Miſs Neville we are all as you may suppose in great anxiety for her Health which I am sorry to add is not in so flourishing a state as I could wish -- she grows thin . is very weak -- & sometimes Coughs -- we are all upon our knees to make her take care of herself . which she resists unmercifully -- but what a sad discovery does this make -- she is in all respects so good . & so delightful -- but she is Unpersuadable . so that it is a melancholy thing to hear that human nature can not be perfect . we have had a good deal of company since I have been here -- I do not quite understand the Politicks of this House -- Lord B : seems attach 'd to Pitt . & as long as he Supports , I presume he will do so -- his Brother 's in law , are decided opponents . to poor Addington -- & are not very gentle in their A d Animadversions on his Measures -- we pray however for the arrival of the definitive Treaty , I must tell you one report , which I do not Credit , nor do I think you will credit -- that Ad——n gives the Princes of the Blood Just as much Money for the Treasury as they please to ask for & to Spend -- this will give you an Idea of the means they use to supplant him in the Publick Esteem . Last Week we had Mr Annesley the Member for Reading -- & after his departure he wrote some news to Lord B : that a great deal of Money was to be rais 'd . That the —— debts are to be paid . & that Fellow & were Executors -- but I flatter my self that if that Gentleman had wrote to a House -- which he knew to be wholly Ad——n s -- he might have told a different Story -- having some little reason to suspect his sincerity -- The pious good Duke of G——r has proved inconstant to Lady Almeria , & has taken to himself a French Marchneſs his former Ta ne Weeps : ( I have no compaſsion ) & I am clear his present favourite lts -- his poor ducheſs -- can neither be sorry or glad , for her time remains to come -- but When I compare this man with my Royal Patron the late Duke of Cumberland . I am very apt to Triumph in his good behaviour -- he always treated his Wife with respect . whatever his private amours might have been I can not pretend to determine but the exterior was decent -- Mrs Fitzherbert is Still so very indifferent , that the World in general think she will not recover but must die -- at present we have Mr & Mrs Windham , the latter is a most excellent & Aimiable Woman -- I shall withhold my Pen -- I will not write what I think of her Husband -- I suppose a greater reversal of fortune never was experienc 'd by any Woman -- nor by any one who deserves the change more entirely -- poor dear Mrs Chapone . I regret her extremely -- I intend 'd to make her Paragone to our dear Mrs Carter -- in my last letter -- Mſ 's I knew she has not been quite so well with her since Mrs Doyle married -- my kind love -- Mrs Jalabert s Compts & the dinner Bell -- obliges me to conclude my self yrs ever & sincely DBlosset Walden Feb . five . 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton -- House Leighton Buzzard GriffinBraybrooke
