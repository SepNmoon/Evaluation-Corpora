Feb ye 13 th Sir You would have received my congratulations long ago , on the happy event of Mrs. Montagu s safe delivery of a Daughter , if a cruel disorder in my eyes had not renderd me incapable of writing ; but tho I am far from being quite relieved from this complaint it is not now violent enough to hinder my expreſsing my joy on the occasion , & gratitude to you for your kind communication of it . You tell me in your letter , that you hope the dear little one will have the virtues & talents of Mrs Dickenson , but to tell you the truth , I should treat this as a presumptionus expectation , these most valuable poſseſsions being rarely hereditary , if the instructions & example the young Lady will receive from its Mother & you did not give security for the p a ccomplishment of your wishes , & hopes ; for what talents might not be depreſs 'd by the dullneſs of a Swiſs ? or what virtues might not be impaired by the levities of a French Governeſs ? But I know the important & delicate task of education will not be committed to any one , but will be attended to by the tender & virtuous Parents . I beg of you dear Sir to present my best respects & sincere congratulations to Mrs Dickenson , & aſsure her , I regret that I had not the earliest opportunity of being introduced to the dear little Stranger . I am Sir Your most Obedt Humble Servant Mrs Dickenson I beg of you to present my complimts to Eliz Montagu , & inform her that I was , from ye disorder in my eyes not able to return my thanks for her good news & obliging manner of imparting manner of imparting it .
