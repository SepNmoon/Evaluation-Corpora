11 , S t . James 's Street ½ past Ten at Night 1 st . April 1799 : My Dear Sister , I presume You intended sending me on a Fool 's Errand , when you ordered your Letter to be conveyed to Mrs- Carter , N o . 25 or 6 Clarges Street , for the good Woman lives at N o . 21 . The Letter I delivered to her Maid , myself ; but , contrary to your former Commands , did not send in my Name . I trust , the Abigail would tell the old Dame , that a smart Valet had brought it . I am glad you & yours are to be here so soon . The third Week , in this Month , I propose going North . Our Illustrious Cousins , Cathcarts , Mansfield Greville 's , & Atholl 's are well , as far as I know , for I have not entered any of their Houses , Cathcarts excepted , since I came to Town . The Cathcarts twice asked me to dine . I was engaged , and could not go , but have seen them several times in a Morning . The Mansfield Greville 's I have called on twice , but without getting admittance . Greville met me in the Street one day , asked me to Dinner , but being disposed of elsewhere , the invitation has not been repeated . Twice have I left my Name at the Atholl Door ; the Dutcheſs has been pigging , & the Litter I suppose is not yet fit for roasting , not having been bidden to the Feast . I left my Name for the Mansfields Portland Place , who have taken no Notice whatever of Me . This is the State of Affection We bear to each other . As it is the fashion , perhaps , when You come to Town , I may not acknowledge you . In the mean time , feel grateful for my condescension in writing to You . Good Night . Love to Mr. Dickenson & your Miſs Brat , Countrywoman & c Ever Your Affect . Brother Napier London , Second April 1799 . Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds . Napier .
