A M Clarke at the Post Office Deal Kent May 26 th - My dear Friend I am induced to trouble you with a letter by the solicitude I feel respecting your health & that of dear Lady Anson & all your Family it is a long time indeed since I had the pleasure of hearing immediately from our dear Louisa this would occasion me much chagrin did I not know from her own declaration that writing letters is irksome to her & were I not also convinced that she has some attachment to me as a friend notwithstanding this uncomfortable silence at with which I can not be offended for the reason she has aſsigned & which circumstance occasioned me much uneasineſs on a from a similar cause respecting my late & lost most dear Friend tell Lady Anson I had the pleasure of hearing that Sir William & herself were well from Mrs : Luxmoore who saw them at I believe Mrs : Cockerel 's aſsembly Did you receive a letter of mine in answer to one I had the pleasure of obtaining from you when Lady Anson was recovering if you should not be very lazy & should answer this pray mention it as it is an uncomfortable circumstance to have a letter lost though there should be no secretes or intelligence of great importance in it which I believe was the case respecting that Epistle -- I hope you & yours have enjoyed the fine & promising spring we have been favoured with . I have been generally at home & much occupied by Music I can not bear so much exercice as I was used to take & it is delightful to me to be what may be called very quiet I had a most kind invitation to paſs the spring with my old friend Mrs. Steers at Chelsea but I feared it would have been at that time too great an exertion so I was obliged malgre my inclination to make the sacrifice I regretted it the more because it would have enabled me to have seen you & your Family & a few more friends I am sincerely attached to & I should have been so much at ease with Mrs : S that she would have been pleased in knowing I was at times happy in the society of my other friends I have hopes I shall go to her for a month in the Autumn we are going to-morrow to remove to other Lodgings in Deal to be nearer the Sea from which health derives benefit & the Landlady who is particularly obliging & goodhumoured has promised to show every attention to my Sister I could wish , should I leave her you perhaps should this take place will have left Devonshire Place -- I hope you pursue your musical studies nothing can be more delightful I wish I could hear you on your Baſs an Instrument I much admire & that you could hear some of Geminiani 's Solos on the Violin accompanied by a Thorough Baſs there is a sweetneſs in the modulation which surpaſses all I have heard on instruments excepting Handel 's airs -- my dear Niece Mary has left Colchester she has lost her sister Mrs. Boggis who lately died & left a Girl of 8 months old very sickly & of which my Niece has undertaken the care hoping that with the divine bleſsing she may be enabled to raise this poor Child Colonel Boggis the Father has also also left Colchester on this melancholy Event my Niece has taken a pretty House Garden & Field within a mile of Stamford Lincolnshire where I hope she is now arriv ed she was induced to this by Mr. Warren 's solicitude to have his two Daughters near him the eldest has been in Town on a visit & it is said is thought to be beautiful she is if I may be allowed to say so a very pretty Girl with an admirable profile .
