Tewin Water 3 rd . October 1782 . I received my Dear Sister 's Note two days ago . I should have answered it by return of Post , had I not been prevented by being obliged to attend to Col. Deakin ( Groom of the B . Chamber to the D. of Cumberland ) an Old Friend of my Grandmother s who has been with us some days . Having contrived to make them play Cards together , I have made use of the leisure moment to make an Apology for my having answerd your last rather pettishly . Every Man has a sore side . You have accidentally more than once touched the tender part . I have suspected that some questions you have asked me , were in consequence of hints dropped by our Cousins . You have once or twice asked me at Breakfast why I did not employ myself more actively in my Military Line ? As you are perfectly acquainted with the state of my Finances , & likewise with the attempts I have made to push myself forward in my Profeſsion , I felt hurt that you should suppose I had not done every thing proper , to prevail upon the Commander in Chief to remove me from a Line of Duty by no means agreable to my Disposition . Our Cousins have frequently asked the same Questions . I have been distreſsed by them , as I have considered them as oblique hints that I might have a want of Spirit . Upon this subject , I have the consolation of knowing , that I ever performed my Duty in the Field to the satisfaction of my Superior Officers and to the approbation of my own Breast . Upon some occasions I have been thanked for my Services . Forgive me My Dear Sister , I feel I am again getting into a scrape , instead of out of one . I beleive I shall not move from this Country till the latter end of this or the beginning of next Month . The Colonel of the 35 th . wrote to me desiring to know what part of Dorsetshire I should wish to remove to . Not having a choice , I left it entirely to him to fix my Quarters & mentioned my desire to remain here 'till next Month . As I have received no answer , he will probably let me stay where I am & resolve on my future destination at his leisure . I hope You will make use of the Franks you now have for me as fast as You can . It is a pity they should be wasted . When do your family remove to Town ? Adieu . Beleive me ever whether in or out of a Pet Your sincere friend and Affectionate Brother N——
