My veriest dear Madam I shall like Saturday just as well as Wednesday . It is true I was disengaged for the last but to you , but I have had a posthumous Engagement since I saw you . Ly Frances Douglas sent to me for Wednesday ; I pleaded my doubtfull promise for wednesday or saturday , but said if it proved the latter , I woud come to her . However , I will certainly call on you on my Way to Ham , & hope to find the outside of Mr Dickenson 's head as sound as the Inside -- whether his heart is as whole , Mi≈øs Clarke best knows . I am the whole Trio 's most devoted HW . Honble . Horace Walpole July 1788
