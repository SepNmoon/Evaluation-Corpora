Monday next there will be a Ball in this part of the County , at which I am to be introduced to the adorable Miſs H . Aged Seventeen -- person tolerable -- face better than one in three you meet with -- fortune £70,000 -- a House & Park well stocked with Deer -- Birth to be sure , not thrice Noble Education admirable -- and from a fault in the construction of her Pallat , she is leſs noisy than the Miſses of this Age generally are -- A qualification very desirable in a Wife . Miſs wants a Title , Master wants her Cash ; so that in all probability matters may be adjusted without much difficulty . The House is only Eight Miles from Town , & a smart post chaise & four shall always be ready to convey your Ladyship to the Mansion . I propose making a very brisk attack & do n't doubt of succeſs , my personal Charms & mental accomplishments being ( as you know ) absolutely irresistable . Your presence will be expected at the solemnization of the Nuptial Rites . As you 're a Poeteſs pray send me some pretty Sonnets of your own composing to Warble to the lovesick Maid . Let there be a proper proportion of Flames , Darts , Loves , Graces , Cupids , Sighs , Groans & Deaths -- Something a la Shenstone will do very well -- for instance 5 What Bliſs Hymens Torches import 6 What Happineſs beams on each Face 7 When Clœlia Laura gives up her Heart 8 And yeilds to her Jockey 's N—— 's embrace 1 Let others of Courts boast the Pride 2 The raptures attendant on State 3 What Joys flow in luxury 's Tide 4 What Transports on greatneſs await 9 Yet Courts have no pleasure for me 10 State raptures afford me no ease 11 Ah Clœlia when absent from thee 12 What is there on Earth that can please 13 Hymens Torches more clearly shall burn 14 More Happineſs beam on each face 15 When Clœlia resigns in her turn 16 And yeilds to her N——r s embrace . I think such verses as these must prevail -- You 'll find them more harmonious if you read them according to the Numbers prefixed to each Line . As I have a fine Voice & a pretty taste for Music I intend singing them to her & then if her heart is not made of Marble I think the fortreſs must surrender . Adieu Yours sincearly & affecly- N Delrow House 3 Janry- 1779 . Miſs Hamilton 's Stairs S t . J ames 's .
