My Dear Miſs H . I must beg their Rl Highſs . 's & all the Company to excuse my coming to Dinner , I should be but a Triste Companion as I could not partake of a Morsel of your good things . I think fasting & keeping myself quiet , will enable me to fulfill my Engagement to Lady M Hume tonight , who expects me a little after Six . I shall order the Chaise to carry me there , but shall want it no more as she is to bring me home at Night , & I hope I shall be well enough to join you at Supper Yrs . C.F . dont think of sending me any thing , for I am better without it
