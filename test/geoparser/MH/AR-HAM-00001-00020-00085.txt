Edinr- 25 th : Janry- 1784 . I had once resolved not to write to My Dear Sister 'till the first of next June , nor do I beleive I should have altered my resolution had not a severe cold confined me to the House . Tired therefore of reading , I write to You merely to keep me from falling asleep . My letter perhaps may bring on You that Inclination I wish to drive from myself . You must not from what I have wrote suppose that I am ill . The weather at present is extremely Cold , hard frost & snow on the ground , I had got my feet wet which was followed by a Sore throat & Toothach . Loyalty to my Royal Mistreſs carried me to an Aſsembly on her birthday , where I increased my complaints ; I have therefore prudently confined myself to the house instead of going to church this morning . To punish You for your saucineſs , I have resolved not to copy one single Sheet of my Journal to the Highlands . Had you treated the first I gave you on that subject with the attention it merited , I might have been induced to expose my remarks even to one of the Blue Stocking Tribe , but as it has been remarked that Miſs Hamilton is perfect Indigo , and as she confeſses to have sojourned with the Empreſs of Shells & Mother Delany for a long period , I must beg to be excused . Now Madam as to your Quarterly Communications , you may follow your own inclination . If writing pleases You , Write . If the contrary is agreable , tant mieux , the leſs trouble shall I have in answering your letters . I hope you are convinced that I am perfectly indifferent about the matter , being thoroughly satisfied that Friendship is a mere word without any meaning in it . Every body makes use of it , and every body would wish the world to beleive that they really felt that Quality , but for my part I agree with the old Song “ Friendship for Interest is but a Name . In this Country We are all Politicians . I was an avowed Reprobater of Mr. Fox 's East India Bill , and have been ever since wishing for a Diſsolution of Parliament . In that event , there will probably be considerable changes among st the Scotch Peers & Commoners . Seven new Candidates for the Honour of representing the Peerage have already declared themselves , Viz -- The Earls of Murray , Balcarres , Kellie Dumfries , & Hopetoun , Lords Cranstoun & Kinnaird -- Whether Ld . Stormont expects to be turned out or not I can not say ; he has however been particularly attentive to strengthen his Interest . Lady Stormont applied to me to support her husband . This was not thought sufficient for the purpose but was followed by Letters from the Duke of Atholl & Lord Cathcart & likewise begging my Vote & Interest for Lord S—— Many people would have refused their request considering the style in which they had behaved to me ; but I thought proper to be civil , & to aſsure His Grace , His Lordship & Her Ladyship that I would support Lord Stormont whether in or out of Office . I do not know whether they feel obliged to me , they have not however thought it expedient to thank me for my Civility , mais je les meprise . Adieu . Be a good Girl & perhaps I may take you into favour again . Ever your Affece . Brother N—— My best Compts- to Miſs Clarke 's & Uncle Frederick . By the bye I hear Miſs Pulteney has run away from the Convent --
