My Dear friends . I should fly towards Leighton-house im̄ediately were my wings at Leisure . They have been much employd since we parted ; and must do more by and bye -- after my Hay is got up , if the weather would permit ; otherwise , the Hay must go to the Fumier , and I to to fulfil my Engagements towards the west . -- you see that you must not flatter yourselves to get me under your benign roof this sum̄er ; and yet I will not poſitively swear not to get time in my power for a few days to Embrace you all . I am not settled yet at Hampton nor can I gueſs when I shall . I long to see the Great Hall at Leighton house which can contain all the Tackles for the Squir 's Sports which he propoſes to enjoy -- may health be the reward for the fatigue ! I am sorry Lady W : destroy 'd our having met this sum̄er at Hampton ; but I hope the next , if we are alive and inclined , to enjoy many days together , between Lieghton house , and Hampton . I must quit you now , as my time is not my own -- so God bleſs you all . Yours for Ever M : Garrick London June July the 1 : 1797 .
