about secret copied E G A Canterbury Augt 27 th - 1772 I was favored with my Dearest Miſs Hamilton 's letter of the 20 th - instant a few days ago , and would have obeyed her commands in writing immediately had I not waited to get some franks , as I was extremely sure all the subject in this , would not be woth worth the postage , excepting what concerned herself so without more preamble take wh- follows be it good , bad , or indifferent , I shall tomorrow my dearest Miſs Hamilton by the stage Coach ſend you that Part of Mrs- Carter s poems that is in print , the rest shall follow another time provided I can coax her out of them & you pleased with these I now send -- you are extremely right in calling my last a scrap of a letter but I could not help it , the whole family being out an airing so was obliged to borrow a peice of Paper from the Butler , or lost lose the post for that day which I should have been ſorry for as I was to sett off for this good City next morning . You ſay you think you have a right to scold , allowed if you please , but an amiable young Lady that thinks she has twenty good reaſons for so doing , and makes use of only one , & that with so much good nature , must and always shall do with me as she pleases , & I shall always think myself much happier by recieving so gentle a Scold ( if it can be called one ) from my dearest Girl than any other favor from the rest of the Sex can poſsible make me & believe me when I aſsure you that it was neither your ambition nor self interestedneſs that made me lay at your feet what you was , in my opinion , born to rule & if you are pleased with what I have done , my greatest deſire is entirely fulfilled -- Nothing can give me more pleaſure than the recieving those ( as you are pleased to call them ) stupid & constrain 'd letters from a Girl in your retired situation pray My dear Madam be so good , as let me have them as often as you poſsible can , & allow me to acquaint you that there is always another sheet of Paper to be got from the ſame place the last came from , so dont make any excuſes of want of Paper for the future and as for the Subject that never can be wanting as there is a young lady at NorthamptonShire called Miſs Hamilton who 's thoughts upon any subject will always give me the highest ſatisfaction to either hear or read . so I think my dear Girl you have now no excuſe either for delaying writing or making them short as that young Lady mentioned above may always be applied too whenever you find yourself at a loſs & any thing . that comes from her will always be recd . with pleasure by me -- your Mama ſays I am partial to you , is it poſsible to be otherwise but you may tell her from me that every body must be so where no fault can be found , nor am I in the least afraid that my Judgement will ever be called in Questio n when my opinion of Miſs Hamilton is to be the subject I wish I could ſay that I was always as right in all my other opinions than indeed you would ſee me a second Solomon in Wisdom & a Daniel in Judgement -- It gives me great pleaſure that Mrs- Napier has been able to be of any use to Mrs Hamilton wt Mr Brown I am ſure any thing she can do you may always com̅and -- When I got to town the thickneſs and heat of the Air made me extremely ill , for which reason I stayed but only one night & did not make one viſit so had not the pleaſure of seeing Sir Wm Hamilton however I hope for that pleasure here in his way to Naples -- I make no doubt of his going to Viena , but I suppose he must first go to Naples to settle not only his own private affairs there but likeways the publick affairs and to give the new amb : a little Knowledge how the land lies -- Lord Cathcart has been very ill of a Fever but I hope now every thing is as we could wish it & that we shall ſoon have the pleasure of seeing him & family -- I thank you my dearest Miſs Hamilton for your Secret & be aſsured I 'll keep it to my self , the anſwer you make for me would do very well for most people but the burden in question wont be too heavy for you , tho I own had you asked my advice without first telling me you had an inclination to do it , I should most certainly have perswaded you not to learn it as its not only tedious in taking up years but when acquired of very little use to any body but those who 's employments are what is called the learned Profeſsions such as Divinity Phiſic & c and all the books in that language proper for your reading ( as many are very improper for Lady 's ) are translated into english I believe full as good as the originals however My Dear Girl if you are reſolved to go on , I beg you 'll keep it a dead secreat from your most intimate friends as well as from the rest of the World as a Lady 's being learned is most com̅only looked upon as a great fault even by the learned , and I would have you not only faultleſs but even not to be suspected of having one , this my dear Mary is my real opinion but I beg you may just follow yr own inclinations but let me know what you do . I have ſince I have been here had a very ſevere fitt of the Gout in my Bowels in ſo much that I had a Phiſician & Surgeon to sitt up wt me almost the whole night , it continued about forty eight hours however thank God , I am at present extremely well . I am greatly obliged to you for concerning your self about our Bustle which you ſaw in the news papers but my dear Girl its all a Canterbury tale . ye Soldiers were called out by a drunk custom house officer but our Adjt , seeing the affair called the Soldiers away and so ended this great Scotch insult upon the Mayor & City of Canterbury , but instead of doing harm the Mayor and Aldermen in a body thanked me for the Good behaviour of our Men , not only in that instance but for the whole time they have been here . I am ſorry that you think the Kitten little the better of Buxton , she certainly did not give it a fair tryal & shall be glad her Father allows her to go back again this Season please my Compliments to her & tell her to keep up her spirits & eat plenty of Milk & bread ( is not that kittens food ? ) and she will do well again . whats become of her Br & Sister as you did not mention them . I do begin to think its not in my Power to give over writing what a size of a letter is this , a good example is a good thing I hope you 'll follow this one , but I shall soon ſee whither you are pleased with me or not , but by the quickneſs & lenght of your next Please make my best respects acceptable to Mrs- Hamilton , Margate is a good place for her to prepair for Buxton next Spring , I am ſure I am not in the least selfish in this advice but my dearest Mary believe yours most affctly - -- WmNapier
