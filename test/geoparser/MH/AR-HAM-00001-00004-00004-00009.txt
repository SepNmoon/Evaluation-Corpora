Sunday Jany . Jan y 4 1784 I have been thinking much , My Dear Miſs Hamilton , upon what paſsed last night and now I will open my mind freely to You on the Subject , and you may make use of what I write as far as You think proper , and with your usual prudence . In first place there is something in the act of Selling that gives a disagreable sensation particularly when the value of the objects for Sale can only be aſscertained by what the french call prix d'Affection however as the first proposal did not come from me but from the Ducſs I shall at once make what I think a reasonable offer to Her Grace -- The Vase , the Head of Jupiter and my Picture of Coregio are the Cream of all the Virtù I have ever poſseſsed poſseſsed in my life and I beleive in my conscience there do not exist three finer Specimens of the perfection of Art . I am particularly circumstanced as to my Corregio ( which induces me to part with it ) for I can not enjoy it as my Lot is to live at Naples and I get it with difficulty from thence in spite of a Royal Mandate not to suffer it to go out of the Country . The Duke of Laurenzano 's family , from whom it was purchased by me , had it from the Collection of Christina Queen of Sweden when She died at Rome , and there is great reason to beleive that it was one of Charles 1st s . Collection as in his printed Catalogue there is mention of the Venus of Corregio Sold by Cromwell for 3000£ and no other picture of a Venus by Corregio existing at present . I have been twice offerd 2000£ for this picture picture but always declared I wou 'd never sell it for leſs than 3000£ . Now if the Ducheſs wou 'd take the Picture at that price I wou 'd let her have the Vase and Jupiter for the same price they cost me , with ye Hercules head and the little curious glaſs ring you mention 'd , and for which Articles I paid exactly £1079 . But if her Grace shoud only be inclined to take the Antiques without the Picture I think them worth , and shou 'd not be tempted to part with them under , the Sum of 2000£ , Nay I am very sure I cou 'd directly get that Sum from the Empreſs of Ruſsia for the Vase alone , but I can not bear the thought of its going out England now it is once safe here , for there is not such a monument of Antiquity in the World -- The Cupid & Psiche of the D. of Marlborough is nothing to it to it & Ly . Betty Germaine told me often that Cardinal Albani had offerd her 4000 Zechines for that Cameo alone . In short the fact is this I have a debt of 3000£ for which I am paying 5 pr . Ct . interest and I am still to pay Mr. Byres for the Vase having given him for it my Bond for 1000£ bearing interest 5 pr . Ct . . Now shoud the Dutcheſs accept the whole of my Offer there woud be a deduction of upwards of 900£ upon what I esteem the real Value of those precious pieces separately & which I woud give up for the sake of being free of debt at Once -- whether the 3000£ for the Corregio was paid now or the interest paid upon my Bond which is in the hands of Mr. W. Hamilton of Lincolns Inn and the Capital paid whenever it might suit the Ducheſs it wou 'd be the same , the Ducheſs woud only stand in my place as to that debt . I am convinced that that if the Ducheſs does make this purchase Her Grace nor any of her Family will ever be loosers ; for such very Capital and well known Pieces must always bear their full Value . Diamonds & precious Stones maybe found at Market but such pieces of Art can only be purchased when the opportunity offers & which is but Seldom -- I have now opend the whole of my thoughts to You read it over twice and communicate to the Ducheſs what You please of it aſsuring Her Grace that what ever is done I shall never open my lips upon the Subject without her consent most sincerely & affectly . Yours My Dr . Niece W.H .
