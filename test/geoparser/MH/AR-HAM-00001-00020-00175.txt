Wilton Lodge 25 th . August 1802 . My Dear Sister , I received your Letter , & the inclosure for old Mother Carter , yesterday . The latter , I instantly returned to its Travels , after having condescended to peruse it , according to Your Commands ; but , my doing so , had nearly been attended with destruction to it , as the Butter it contained , made me Bilious , and gave me an instantaneous inclination to puke ( saving your presence ) . It really entertains me to see how You blue Stocking Ladies compliment , and adore one another . By the bye , I have always forgot to tell You , that Mrs- Douglas , late Mrs- Beauvoir , late Miſs Sharp , who nibbled her Nails , instead of eating the Hot Rolls at S t . James 's , lives within twenty Miles of me . I have never seen her , since she came to reside at Kelso , but have met with him . Maria & I propose going into that Neighbourhood , in the course of this Autumn , to pay a Bridal Visit to a Relation of mine , who has been married these two Years nearly , and is was bleſsed with a Son & Heir , some Months ago . All this time , however , I have never had leisure to wait on him . These tiresome customs of the World are very annoying . How absurd i s i t , to put one 's self to inconvenience , by travelling twenty Seven Miles to see People , for whom , indifference is the only feeling ? If I had swallowed my breakfast , perhaps , I might have entertained You , with a Sentimental Disquisition on this Subject . But , having just been startled by the sonorous blowing of my reverend Brother Dr. Hunter 's Nose , echoing through the Hall , I presume , some of my small Fry will very soon call me to Tea , and Toast , as his Reverence seldom descends from his Morning Meditations till about the hour of Attack . Do You understand Persian ? My eldest Boy ( not sixteen till October , but measuring five feet Nine Inches in stature , “ long , lank , and boney , like “ any Little tony ) ” , is sitting by me , disfiguring , and blotting my smoothest and best writing Paper , pretending that he is forming Persic Characters . It is a delightful thing , and vastly gratifying to a Parent , when a Child knows more than himself . Not that I suspect my William will be guilty of so great a Crime as to become learned , and thereby rival the fame of his Ancestor , who invented the Logarithms , & Rhabdologiæ , likewise writing a Treatise on the Revelation of S t . John , in which , we his Descendants know that he is mistaken , having fixed the General Judgement to take place in the Year 1786 , and still we breathe in the Year 1802 . No , I comfort myself , that my Boy will not waste his Vigils , in deep Study . Like myself , I suspect , if he can procure Meat , drink , & cloathing , without much mental exertion , it would suit him self as well , and he would be better contented , than even to gain admiſsion into Your Tribe , an honour I never dared to aspire to . Having written the best part of three Pages of Nonsense , it is now time to say , that I trust Your Nerves have regained a firmer Tone , than when Your Letter was written , and that You may not have any more alarms from Fire . I like the account You give of Louisa ; but , pray dont let her grow quite so fat as Yourself , as in that Case , there will be no room for Mr. Dickenson in the Carriage . I hope the Grouse may afford him amusement . Here , the Shooters stand some chance of being drowned . It rains every day , and the Moors are very wet . I fear , that the Harvest in this Country will be very late , and must suffer considerably , unleſs the weather turns very dry . Last Year , my Crops of all sorts were in the Barn Yard in the first week of September . This year , I only finished stacking my Hay , on Saturday . Maria joins me in best wishes to You & Yours . Ever My Dear Sister , Your Affecte- Brother Napier Compts- to my Countrywoman .
