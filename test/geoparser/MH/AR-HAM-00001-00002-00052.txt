Thursday -- We went a Coursing & as it often happens when a person wishes to shew diversion they are disappointed & so it was with us -- I rode Mr. H. Parkin s blind mare & had a sufft . Occupation in taking Care to bring my bones back safe & whole -- he told me he had rode her 115 miles one day from 1 in the morning & got home before 12 -- This may be so -- but it is travelling fast -- The rest of the Cavalry were engaged -- Poney has the Strongles & all the Rest somehow occupied & therefore I was obliged to ride blindy as I did not choose to walk so much -- Friday -- After breakfast Hayden proposed to shew me his Estates & he took thro his Woods which I would have excused him doing as it did not suit my knee which is not worse than it was , but now & then grumbles a little -- what from my Weakneſs in that part & other reasons which deter me from jumping off the Hedges I have given up Shooting as it does not suit my Antiquity Hayden took this opportunity of comparing the difference of his Situation with his Brothers which certainly will be very great -- but he is a very imprudent young Man & no experience will ever make him steady -- From what he said I dont think his Mother can ever accommodate matters with him for her to remain here , indeed I have taken pains to convince her of this imprudence of continuing here with a diminished Income James is extremely young & has no idea of the value of money & is too lately returned from 7 Years residence at Oxford & the Society & Stile of living of young Men of Fortune to know what attention is requisite for the management of an Establishment -- Whilst I was out Mr. Dayvy called here & wished I would go to Bampton tomorrow to give him my Aſsistance about the picture Hayden gave me a letter of Introduction to a Gentn at Plymouth wch . I may or may not make use of -- I then set off for Taunton about one -- at 2 I took a ride with Mr. J. Paynter upon the new road under the beautiful Woods for an hour -- Saturday -- I am going to Bampton -- Mr. Paynter wd . have left this place tomorrow , but I have advised him to stay till monday morning & go wh me in a Chaise to Tiverton which will save him one night & a day 's journey he can then take his days ride without so much fatigue James proposes to meet him somewhere & attend him to Cornwall about 90 miles , as it is not fit for him to go alone -- I believe I shall be under the neceſsity of taking a post Chaise all the Way to Exeter 25 miles & then take the Mail as other Coach , of which there are plenty to Plymouth & shall probably get to that place before you are up on Tuesday morning & when you are sipping yr- Tea you may conclude my person to be removed the greatest distance from you that it ever has been yet since our marriage , but the Heart remains Stationary if there is any Comfort in that Reflection for you -- I long to see you again & have felt half inclined not to extend my journey , but The Weather is so fine that it induces me to go on as I originally proposed to Plymouth . It will be very few miles out of my Way to call at Clifton & it will also break the Neck of the journey , & the palavering Compy . of the Shrewd One will amuse me for a Time -- Adieu ma chere Amie Kiſs Louisa for me -- Kind Regards to Mor . Ever Yours Most Affy JD Nothing can exceed the Kindneſs & attention I have received from this family Single To Mrs. Dickenson 32 Devonshire Place London
