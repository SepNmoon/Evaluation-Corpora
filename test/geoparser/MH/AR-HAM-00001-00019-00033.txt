Canterbury Feby 11 th - . 1773 Yours My dearest Mary of the 4 th & 5 th - inclosing Mr Hope letter only came to hand last post where it has been lying I know not but it has come on an unlucky day to answer it as I am afraid it will not be in my Power to make this a long one having many to write but would not delay it , as you ſeem to be deſirous to know about my health which I thank God is at present very well tho I have a small Cough which in this weather is not surprising as the Snow is now lying deeper here than ever remembered by the oldest person in the County with a very hard frost . It gives me the greatest pleasure imaginable to hear from you that Mrs- Hamilton is so very well believe me she has my most ſincere Wish that her health may continue that you may both be bliſsings to one another . Indeed my dear Girl I take as great care of my health as any body can poſsible do , tho I own was I with you I might still be induced to take more in purpose to be nursed by My dear Ward , which might not be the best way to be free from Complaints as invalids very frequently over nurse themſelves however if I was free from the little Cough that I have I dont remember being better for ſeveral years than I feel myself this very day , Believe me no bodys instructions will go farther with me than yours as I am quite satisfied that every thing you would deſire me to do would be for my advantage . You deſire to know whither the Greys come to Northampton this year or not , it is not as yet decided whither the Regiment goes to Suffolk or Northampton the last named place by the rotation we sh.- most certainly go too but I hear Ld Panmure is making interest for us to go to Suffolk & as I am to be from the regiment its much the ſame thing to me whither they send us or not to any of them , had I been to continue with the regiment this year I should most certainly have chused to have been with you but as thats not the case I am very indifferent where they are sent . What a flattering little Gipſy you are with your penetration however as I can just return the Compliment in the same way & words I shall only beg you to remember what you ſaid about it and to believe you have just wrote & spoke my sentiments of yourself exactly and I make no doubt but the ſame will last as long as I do , & I hope I shall never forfiet those sentiments you are so kind as to profeſs for me and believe me had I ever thought you had any thing of a mere Miſs I should never have had any connexion wt you as I think them one of the greatest plagues God almighty sends on the earth for the punishment of our Sins ( I dont mean the Male Sex only , as they are a plague to every creature they are concerned with ) & from whom Good Lord deliver me & my friends . I do not My dearest Girl accuse you of vanity as I most sincerely believe you think every word of what you write concerning a mutual attachment , but great care ought to be taken before any body forms one , especially the fair Sex , with the Male Sex , as those attachments may be extremely dangerous , especially in this age where the Men are bred up & indeed think there is not ſuch a thing as a virtuous Woman in the world . ( I am ſorry to ſay they have really ſome reasons for their opinion at least among the married ones in high life for ſome years past ) and where attachments are formed with ſuch person I am afraid the Lady commonly comes off with the worst of it , so I beg my dearest Ward to be always cautious and never in a hurry to make friendship 's with either Sex especially ours , & I know was you to be disappointed o i n any of your friendships you are by constitution much too sanguine to take it coolly & give them up without hurting yourself , so my advice to M y dearest Ward to summer & winter them as the proverb ſays before you form any connexion with them , People like you with a good honest affectionate heart are apt to believe every body is like yourself but believe me My dear Mary the world is very , very , different from what they appear , and deceit now ſeems to be a science more studied than any of the virtues ever were -- It give me great pleaſure to hear your little Mare is come home tho I beg you 'll take care of yourself when riding her and always keep a good bridle hand upon her for fear of Accidents I wish I was near enough to ride every day with you however I am happy she has no vicious tricks , & that she may learn none let nobody ride her but yourself on any Account whatsoever I need say nothing of the Kitten but ſend Compts- & I am afraid she is paſsed mending . You deſire to know what occaſsion a Woman has to take an offer where her heart is not concerned . In my opinion None but from the instant a Girl is able to understand any thing she is told she must have a Husband by Mother , Maid , & viſitors till ſuch time as her little head is full of nothing elſe & she believes it the summum bonum of this Life and the thoughts of being that detested thing an old Maid frights Miſs so that rather than wait till she meets with a Man that can engage her heart and make her happy she takes the first offer as Mama tells her that good ones dont come every day , so Miſs is married , ( as Love is to come afterwards ) and finds herself in a few months a most miserable animal especially if she is unfortunate enough to see a man she likes better than her Husband now My dearest Mary have I not anſwer 'd your question Yea , or Nay , is not what I say com̄only the Case I refer to Mrs- Hamilton if you chuse an umpire in the mean time My dearest Girl believe me most Affctly- yours W.N.—— remember me particularly to Mrs- Hamilton & please send ye inclosed to Mr Hope
