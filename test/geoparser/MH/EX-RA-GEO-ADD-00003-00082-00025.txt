My dearest dearest dearest Friend I may now with more reason than ever call you so for you have acted with that true sincerity , and openneſs which denotes that sacred Character . The next thing to not committing a fault is to confeſs it , and to endeavour to amend it , this was all that remains for me now to do . I am sensible I must have lowered myself in yr . esteem , did not I tell you so myself , for that little thing called conscience will frequently come acroſs us and most frequently so , when we least expect it . The confidences You have placed in me I never have as yet betrayed , and hope in God never shall , for altho ' I have many faults , I hope my real intrinsick honor will ever remain untainted . As to ye . person I conversed with ye . Evening of my B.D . I never placed in him any thing approaching to what may be called confidence in them , never more than as to what private conversation leads one to ; I will tell you ye utmost I ever placed in him , one Evening I was in his Room I desired to have a Glaſs of Negus for I was very thirst y , it was brought me and just before I drank it he said addreſsing himself to me do you really like that Girl ( concerning whom he was speaking you may easily gueſs ) once I thought her a good fine person . my answer to this modest speech was I really think her a most agreable Girl , & then I drank ye . Lad ie y s health , this is ye . utmost confidence I ever have placed in him relating to myſelf or to ye . young Lady then mentioned . I am now I hope not tho ' too late , sensible how improper it is to form any sort of intimacy or connection with low persons , nothing can be so detrimental to the manners of a Gentleman as keeping low Company , I am more and more persuaded of ye truth of this every day . I will now cease to have any thing more to do with insignificant Characters and in bidding them an eternal Adieu , I will cease to be one myself . My Friend I have as strong sensibility as any body , and ye tender paſsions have almost a stronger effect upon me than they have upon any body else . The Morning of my B.D . I could not refrain from tears when I met my everbeloved Parents , their bleſsings and felicitations were almost too much for me , they were too much for my spirits which are naturally not strong , those also of all my wellwishers ( I will not profane ye Name of Friend ) pleased me greatly , ) but when I came to one Person , real , sincere , and everadored Friend , I could have embraced her with ye . tenderneſs and respect I did my own Mother , all other sentiments were at that moment banished , and I could have poured forth in her bosom , in a torrent of Tears , ye . pleasing weight tha n t then oppreſsed my Soul . As to Ye . custom of swearing you mention , I perfectly agree with you , I think it a most indelicate , ungentlemanlike & wicked practice , custom and I can not help saying imitation , has brought it upon upon me , hearing people who are in ye . Army do so , & one especially who I know wishes me very well , & whom I have a great affection for , I mean Lt .. C.Colonel L.Lake I thought it was neceſsary for me to shew I was now become a Man , and therefore I gave too much into this infamous practice . Yr advice & let me say yr . desire would have been sufficient for me to ha v e left of t such an execrable custom , without ye . instance you gave me to corroborate yr . advice what you had just been saying , yr . feelings at that moment could not be but greatly pleasing & flattering to me . I now my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend , solemnly declare before you , that I will never because it may be a fashion copy or follow ye . vices of other men , whatever I may do concerning their follies , that also will wear out with time . My honor was always dear to me , however you very properly and with great reason blame me for making light of ye . expreſsion , you never shall hear it again made use of as a word of course in common conversation , or lightly or inconsiderately upon any subject . I have not ye . Book called ye . Connoiſseur , I never heard of it before , but inform me what sort of Book it is , and I will soon it . I entreat of you my dearest , dearest , dearest , Friend to explain to me what you mean about deceit , in ye .. piece of Myrtle that was taken & thrown away immediately after , if you mean the remainder of ye . Bouquet I siezed upon , I took up it before one of my B—— I meant no deceit in it , however I am not at present bright I do not understand you , therefore I entreat of you again to explain yourself in yr . next . I take no notice of ye . other insignificant character you mention , for I have just told you , that in bidding them Adieu , I wld .. cease to be one myſelf . Pray my delightful , agreable , charming Friend ; continue to tell me Truths , and to lay me open to my ſelf , for else I ſhould find no one upon Earth who would treat me with such freedom , my friendship with you , will be I plainly see conducive to great future happineſs to me , it is an intimacy I ſhall endeavour to cultivate with ye . greatest aſsiduity whatever our situations may hereafter be . As to the attachment for you I at present paint in such strong terms , I hope it will be as permanent as my Soul , I will not say that of a hot headed , young Lover , but that of a loving Brother to an affectionate Sister , we never never never can be separated at least without corresponding , for it will certainly break my heart if we are . Thus far my affection for you will in terest fluen ce my future actions , that if ever I hear yr . name mentioned I shall be roused to ye . quick , and mention ed my ever-doated upon friend in the terms which she deserves . Never hurry yrself into taking any step upon my account which wld .. make you repent having taken it , be it but for a moment . For were I to see you in ye . arms of a Man whom you did not nor could not love , jealousy , love , dispair wld .. conspire together to tear my bosom , as I should look upon myself as ye . Author of all yr . Unhappineſs , misery & private discontent . Whereas if I was to see you enjoy ye . embraces , careſses and endearments of a beloved Husband with whom you was well established , I shld .. rejoice at seeing my everadored Sister bleſsed with such felicity . I think I have answered yr . quotations in ye . course of my Letter , therefore I ſhall take no notice of them here . Pray continue yr . instructions to me , as I hope you will find they will have ye . effect upon me my dearest Sister wishes they should have . I am happy when I know I engroſs yr . thoughts be it for a moment , I know ye . tenderneſs of yr . heart , I know you have more than is requisite for yr . own felicity . I understand what you mean to convey by yr . expreſsions perfectly , the affection of my dearest Mother for all her Children , I am well acquainted , ye pain she suffers for her dear Lieutentant Colonel Gerard Lake she wishes to conceal from his Father for fear of increasing his pains by shewing hers , and for fear of being accused of maternal tenderneſs weakneſs . I adore ye . delicate feelings of a tender heart , such as yrs . which is beyond anything that can be mentioned , and yr . noble sentiments , and yr . exalted principles these have made such a deep impreſsion on my heart that I fancy not even death itself will eface them . I thank you my charming friend for yr . tenderneſs on my B . W—— situation I own that he & my dear W—— constitute a great part of happineſs but there is one person more who constitutes ye . whole of it . I also thank you my dearest dearest dearest life , for ye . silent tear you dropped that perhaps ere long I also might be in danger of ye . Sword , or perhaps ere ere long no more , I think if I know you this wld .. make you shed a few tears , were ye . Enemies of my King & Country to land I ſhould look upon it as ye . greatest happineſs that cld . befall me to die in defence of them both . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu . ever dearest , dearest dearest Friend may you hereafter enjoy boundleſs prosperity may Heaven pour down its choicest bleſsings on you , I shall ever be sincerely attached to you until my last breath , I am yr . ever sincerely affectionate F—— . P.S . I had begun another Letter which I mentioned to you last Night , but I did not go on with it as I did not think it was calculated for ye subject I was going to write upon . Once more Adieu , Adieu , Adieu , ever-adored Friend .
