25 th . July -- However imprudent my conduct it may have been in havg acknowledged to return your friendship -- think not that I shall act so base a part as to encourage such warm declarations -- You forget surely that Providence has placed you in a situation wch . it is , & will be your duty to support in every respect , & act up to in every instance -- as your friend -- -- the character is a sacred one , it is my duty to remind you what you owe yourself -- I must be much deceived in you , if you ever want a monitor to remind of what you owe to others . Indeed Indeed my friend I tremble for you -- my God what will become of you if you suffer yourself to be led away with such impetuosity -- reflect I beseech you upon what I am going to say -- you have seen little of ye . world -- you fancy yourself attached -- shall I paint the Object ? Inferior in Birth -- no beauty to attract -- no person to captivate -- poſseſsed only of ye . most common accomplishments , an honest heart we will allow -- this may be sufficient for a Friend , but wld- disgrace -- for how disgraceful for you to pretend to feel any thing more ! Oh my friend beware of suffering yourself to be led away -- 2 d you will soon have captivating objects present themselves -- vanity that ruling paſsion will make them encourage you , & you will be drawn in to commit some folly that will leſsen you in the eyes of ye- world -- I speak ye dictates of my Soul -- I had rather for ever forfeit ye . satisfaction of your friendship than be guilty of concealing any thing , however unpleasing to your feelings , wch . I thought would prove detrimental to your character , honor , & real happineſs -- Adieu I have time only to add , that I ever will act up to the character of Your friend , whatever ever event may happen , whatever appearances things make take , judge not from them -- but believe me no one on earth has your happineſs -- or your credit more at heart than your faithful & affte . Friend
