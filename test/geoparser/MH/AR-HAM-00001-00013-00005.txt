Impromptu by Mr. Glover Sunning Hill Octer 15 th . 1779 Ye lovely stars of Sunning dale Which you with brightneſs fill , Leonidas muſt now bewail Your distance from the hill . There damps and rain di s ſ solve your charm ; Sore cramps his speed have barr 'd ; Poor wife sighs oer a scalded arm , And can not hold a card .
