My Dst I am hurt to find by your Letter that you are so low , that you have reason to be hurt by the little you said to me on Sunday , is but too t rue , but yet my Own appearances very often are deceitful , & I hope in this case it will prove so at last , will you forgive me if unasked I give you a peice of Advice , if you could by any method that would not wound your delicacy , bring on an Eclairſsiment do it , have you no Friend sufficiently acquainted to do it ? beleive me if I kn ew the Person I would with all my heart , I have known by experience , what misery is undergone for want of explanation , & if it is not done at first it is too late , if you should meet do not look displeased , for conscious himself of having acted unkindly it will make him fear to aproach when perhaps if you lay aside the Female Pride , ( which on these ocaſsions are is always misplaced ) he will venture to speak & own himself in the wrong , & you may be happy , I again my Dst beg you will pardon this Liberty , it proceeds from a Heart that knows the feelings of yours , knows its worth , & wishes you to be happy . -- Indeed I am not conscious of shewing a preference by having given my Picture to Mou Mou , ( by the by take care you do not make me too vain , by such kind reproaches , ) I have not Amour propre enough to give my Picture unasked , & last Summer ( or rather Autumn ) she begged I would give her a Profile , which I never found time to sit for , & upon her liking my Picture that Mrs Compton has , & expreſs ing it a little before I left London , I told her if she would be satisfied with a Copy , I would get it , now my Dear if you wish such a Phiz as mine should be seen in yr Apartment , I will desire Mrs Compton to have it copied , & have the pleasure of present in g it to you . I am sorry the Q thinks P Mary fractious & spoilt , however I bel ie ve Monday Afternoon in the Phaet on she was of a different opinion , for she said to me more then once what a reasonable little Creature she was , I am sure she was this Morg at Lady Cowper s every thing one could wish , & so she would ever be if she was to be unmixed , & seen what she really is . God Bleſs you my Dst , I thank you a thousand times for yr kind intentions of to Night , but am not so unreasonable as to expect it often . I wish you could go to Ireland with the Dartrys , for it would certainly be of service to you , my kind Compts to them I beg -- I hope it wont be many Days before I Embrace you at the Q House I do it now cordially in Idea MCG -- Wednes day Night --
