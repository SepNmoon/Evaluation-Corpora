My dear Miſs Hamilton I was much oblig 'd by your kind Meſsage to Day & by one I receiv 'd from you some time Ago & I aſsure you how wish 'd to wait on you long before this -- But I think I have been prevented doing almost every thing this Winter that I have intended -- I have lately had a Cold & been a good deal Confin 'd . But I hope in the Course of next week to make you a Morg Visit if I hear nothing to ye Contrary till Thurs I shall call -- Believe me dr Miſs H . much yrs HF Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street
