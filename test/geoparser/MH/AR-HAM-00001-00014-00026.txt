My Dearest I trouble you with the inclosed to Prſs Elizh , & tho not many memorable Events have happened , I have Sanity enough to think my Scrawl will not be unwelcome , I wish you was here , every thing has been chearful and good humored the most ridiculous thing that has happened was Mr Arnold being ordered to be introduced by William Arnald to Col Lake as the new Cannon he had no Idea of its being properly performed without attempting a Salute , which I thought he had been successful in , but that he with great vehemence denies , & certainly , as appearances sometimes are deceitful I will not insist but I saw his Face very near hers , & you may imagine what a Sight it was , I thought I should have expired , & was yet frightened to death for fear of offending her he declares he will never attempt again & they are both equally afraid of each other -- I am enchanted with Harlyford which you do not wonder at this Morg we are all quiet , Mrs Bludworth is gone out with the Princes & c & c King is at home , the Q alone and P Royal translating in the Room with me , she is vastly good , & you then know how pleasing , I wish Love to you , God Bleſs you my Dear my Love to Prſs Augusta , & Mou Mou , & believe me with great Sincerity Your faithful & Affce Chi Chi -- Windsor 10 th . Sepbr 1779
