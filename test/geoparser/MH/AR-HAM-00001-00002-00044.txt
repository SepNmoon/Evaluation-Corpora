Oakford 1 Sepr . 13 I set out at 9 from Wellington & got here at half past one and am shook almost to a Jelly -- I have heard of Devonshire Roads but could have no Conception of them till I had seen & felt them -- it is impoſsible for any thing to be worse & so narrow that it is sometimes difficult to make an Arrangement to let a single horse paſs -- the side W indows are obliged to be down to prevent the Boughs from breaking them & in hot weather it would be particularly pleasant as they enter the Carriage on both sides -- just now it is rather amusing , as you gather Nuts without any trouble -- On one Occasion I could not help smiling , I met a Lady on Horseback with a Gentn . behind her & I could without remarked the difficulty he had to know what to do with his hands , as one without a constant Res traint traint must natur ally fall in the Fair Dame 's Lap -- I merely write to let you know that I have paſsed 17 Miles of the Devonshire X Country Roads in a Chaise and am alive after it -- I find my hand shakes but that will be remedied -- Mrs. P . recd . me wh- great Cordiality -- James is out -- & Margt . is on her Way from The Hays -- Adieu I shall write on Friday , no Saturday -- Friday is no post Most Affy Yrs . JD At Wellington , which is a little neat Town & at the Squirrel where I sojourned , I observed a Turnspit They keep up the old Custom -- a very pretty Terrier is the Officiator -- He seemed very ready to show me his Abilities & is never out of the Way when his Services are wanted & the old Lady of the House said he likes it as well as catching Rats -- This is a delightful day -- no Sun & very warm -- I have only seen two bad crops of Wheat all the journey -- Barley is the finest that has been known for a great length of time -- Single To Mrs. Dickenson 32 Devonshire Place London
