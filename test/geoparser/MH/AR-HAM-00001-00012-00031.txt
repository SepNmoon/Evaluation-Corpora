My Dear Miſs Hamilton , I have but 5 Minutes left to write a Line before the Post goes , Miſs G . will tell you the sad Catastrophe that has happen 'd of the Packet being taken that carried Mrs Feilding from Lisbon , & as Mr & Mrs Graham & Miſs Cathcart are involv 'd in the same Distreſs , I determin 'd to write you a few words , that you may inform Lady Stormont that they are safe & well at Vigo in Spain , where they were landed by the American Privateer ( that took them soon after they sail 'd ) the 26 th . of June . Mrs Feilding herself wrote me this Account . 't is probable Mr Graham has convey 'd the same Intelligence to England , but as all Posts are attended wth . uncertainties at such a distance , I thought it wd . be a Satisfaction to you & to Ly Stormont to have such Authentick Account of their Safety . The rest of the Story as much as we know , my Letter to Miſs G . will inform you of , & I am Sure you will pity us all for this distreſs . Adieu Ever most Affly . Yrs . C.Finch I wrote by the Packet that sail 'd last Sunday July 1 st . both to you , & to Miſs Goldsworthy . Caldas July 4 th . 1781 -- To Miſs Hamilton
