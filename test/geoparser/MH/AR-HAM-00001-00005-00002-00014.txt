Stanley House 1 Oct .. . I take the first opportunity of thanking my Dear Hble . Mrs. Murray for her obliging and entertaining letter not , that I think I shd . have done it so quick but the opportunity of Honble Wilhelmina Murray 's being with us to frank it , tempted me to intrude so soon on your time as I wished to tell you how pleased I am , with the idea of your being so near London and likly to continue there some time , as we flatter ourselves with hopes to have the pleasure of seeing you on our arrival , the distance being so easy . -- as we propose to leave the country , the beginning of Novr . therefore you will be sure to hear of us , No . 110 Park Street and if you are disposed , to follow my good example in answering me directly , please to direct to Stanley House , near Perth -- without enclosing it ; as the Gen : is going South : therefore , any under his cover , would travell a long time , before it came to me . -- your Anecdotes entertained me very much , but that of Mrs. Dickenson did not surprise ; as She has been loseing her memory for a great many years and of late , has been odd to a great degree so no wonder she should have forgot the Saxons & c as for that of Gen : Murray I have often heard it from those personaly acquainted with him , and the fact was , that Lady Tweedale had been a footman very low and illiterate . got a great fortune in the S . Sea year , and had the good fortune that , to marry that Exellent Woman Sir Mathew Decker that we all remember but that , niether made him a better scholar , nor a Gentleman .. when he was a dying , he was very uneasy and the celebrated Sir John Germaine , then Rector of S t . James 's was sent for to aſsist him . but on coming he found him totaly ignorant of every thing and believing in nothing . he thought it in vain to atempt teaching a dying man , therefore asked to read to him which being accepted he opened the Bible , and read our Savr . Sermon on the mount . Lady Betty was much pleased and sd . it was an exellent book , who had wrote it ? Sr . Mathew replied Doctor Clarke , the other never having heard of any Saint , but a great deal of Sr. John his Neighbour , replied indeed ! I never thought he had been able to write so well . The answer surprised the Doctor but nothing more paſst , and it did not occurr to him that he confused the Saint and the Sir . but on every body 's surprise at the clause , then added to the Will Dtr . Clarke recollected and told the circumstance that most likly ocasioned it -- I must apologise for having begun this letter on a half sheet , but Sir Mathew , in writting yesterday , had tore it off so neatly , that till I came to turn over I never found out part had been used -- The influenca has been all over the country even the Highlands have not escaped ; and all the familly at Atholl House have had it but Doctor Clarke , the Duke of Atholl and the Duke -- her Grace is in expectation of soon adding another Bon n y Lad , or Laſs ( to use the Scots poets expreſsion ) to the number she is already bleſt with : but continues as yet in perfect good health -- Dutcheſs has paſst the Last holidays at my Brother s with his two School-fellows and was much pleased . the situation of Ockham and that his has been used to among the Highlands it must apear like a differrent world to him -- you give but a Melancholy acct . of the R . Familly the poor Princeſses seem to have sufferr 'd very much ; and tho ' Lady Elizabeth is got well it does not apear Lord Tullibardine is she is so pleasing every body is interested in her health , which seems but very bad -- . Ps . Mary does not seem to please , so much as expected , having with all the Follies of Youth too much of the foriegn Hauteur to paſs it off . and serves to sett of his brother s to more advantage who is more Easy -- his late purchase is certainly a good one for a prince there is just Elbow room sufficient for amusement , without any com̄and to give jealousy or distance from Court to have tales and reports prevail before they could be contradicted -- pray do You hear what is become of Ps . Elizabeth a storry has prevailed that he stript the D . Palace of Plate and valuables converted it into money . and then sett off for Italy with a Venus I am much obliged for your recom̄endation of the books which I shall try and get from Perth but fear of succeſs as their librarys are not very good and we generaly find it easier to get our things from London than Edinburgh -- the adition to The Duke of York letters will be a great acquisition if they can be fairly made out , but I think the stile will soon shew them to be genuine or not -- I think the act . coming out of the Memoires of the Late P.E . if fairly well told , may be made not only amusing but interesting ; as she had a busy life among all ranks . it is not thought her Estate in Ruſsia tho ' a tract almost as large as England will sell for sufficient to pay the legacies she has bequeathed -- her death was ocasioned by the paſsion she put herself into on being told one of her law suits was likly to be decided against her , the agitation broke a blood Veſsell of which she died next day -- her house near Calais she has left in its present state all to the com̄andant in being -- Madame de Sevignée 's choice seems to promise happineſs , as that familly has been always marked as amiable well behaved , and well Educated -- without which I think behaviour and Character is always precarious -- have you read The Sisters wrote by Ducheſs of Kingston ( Lord Carmarthen s daughter . ) where that lecon is strongly incuculated . and I think the whole is wrote in a pleasant stile , and better than the usual style of Novels -- my paper is near at an end before I tell you we have taken charge of a neice during the absence of her Father , who is gone to Lisbon on the hope of recovering his Eldest daughter a beautifull Girl of 18. he has burried his wife ( the Captain s Sister ) and nine children of consumption and having only two left has separated them for fear of the youngest catching the cough -- we shall carry her to London to finish her masters so that I flatter myself she will be returned to Mrs. Hervey much improved my good Husband & Sister joyn me in best wishes to Yr Self & Mrs. Beckford not forgetting the fair Mr. Farquharson . I am yrs . affectly Mr. Dickenson
