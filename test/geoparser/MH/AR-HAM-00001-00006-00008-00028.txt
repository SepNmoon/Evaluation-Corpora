I received a Letter a few days ago , my dear Miſs Hamilton , that has made me appear to myself like a Wanderer on the face of the Earth . -- I have been intending these two days to move my Lodgings ; -- but I can not have the Reſolution to go into ſuch a ſolitary House . -- I will do it however tomorrow , for I am almoſt as bad ſitting here alone . -- The look 'd too dismal for me to day ; -- nay , I thought my friend look 'd unusually grave at me ; -- but ſhe has not her Spirits at Command ; -- A Cloud , or a ſight of the Sun rules a Woman of Sense ! -- You ſhall have the particulars of the Letter above mention 'd , firſt time we meet . Mean while , let me beg you 'll lay your Commands on me when you chooſe I ſhould attend you , for , believe me , nothing but the fear of becoming too troubleſome & familiar , could keep me out of your Houſe . -- Mr : is juſt come in to ſit with me ; ſo with better ſpirits , I wiſh my dear Miſs Hami & her kind mama -- Good Night -- Your affecte : friend J .
