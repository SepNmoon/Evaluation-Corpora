Teingmouth June 27 th 1785 . / My Dear Cousin ./ I have not written to you since I came here , because there really was nothing for me to communicate , worth troubling you with -- I now take up the Pen with great pleasure , having so good an occasion for it as to beg you to accept my best Wishes and Congratulations upon your Marriage -- My Father is writing to you , but I wou 'd not commiſsion him to remember me in the kindest manner to you instead of writing myself , because , altho ' /as I said before/ I have nothing to communicate ; I thought /knowing your kind friendship for me , / that you wou 'd rather I shou 'd write./ We receiv 'd Robert 's Letter dated from Clarges Street , and were very sorry to find by it that your excellent Friend Mr : Glover , was gone to Bath on account of his health . We were the more particularly sorry , because we knew it must vex you very much -- We hope however that he will benefit by his excursion to Bath -- I wrote about a Week ago to Miſs Glover , and directed my Letter to Sunning-Hill , I hope it has reach 'd her./ I will now conclude as my Mother wishes to add a few Lines to you , and beg you to believe me , my dear Cousin yours affectionately./ J : Hamilton ./ Altho ' My Dear Mrs. Dickenson might justly think that all our congratulations shoud have been expreſsed by one only of a family knowing how much your leisure must at present be engroſsed upon the happy occasion , yet I shoud not have felt comfortable had I commiſsioned any one to say for me how sincerely I partake in the general Satisfaction with your other friends ; and I do it in this way as a postscript to my Daughter s letter hoping you will answer it in kind , without troubling yourself with a separate Sheet ; upon the same principle , I will trust to your supposing for me , that I feel every thing upon the subject of your present and future happineſs as if I had detained you by the perusal of pages . I hope Mr. H . has told you how delighted Robert was with your Attention to Him . He was indeed as perfectly Sensible of it as one shoud suppose from the goodneſs of his Heart : But I fear you will have a powerful Rival in Mr Dickenson with whom he seems to be quite captivated , and gave us the whole history of his Endeavors to Entertain and amuse him and how we ll he succeeded . I beg My best Compliments to Mr Dickenson who se acquaintance I shall now be doubly happy to improve and remain My Dear Mrs. Dickenson , with the most regard , your very faithful and obliged , Hum ble - Servant R Hamilton Teingmouth 27 th June 85 .
