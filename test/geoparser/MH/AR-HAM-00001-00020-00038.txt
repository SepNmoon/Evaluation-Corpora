Edinburgh 30 th . Septr- 1780 . I should very readily have obeyed your Orders with regard to your books had your letter reached me before my departure from Welwyn . They are however safely locked up at Tewin Water & shall be sent to my Dear Sister as soon as I return to Quarters , which will be about the first of December . Mr- Farhill 's letter pleased me very much & I expect You will summons him to aſsist me in devouring your hot Rolls when I next pay my respects to You . I can not help admiring your presumption in telling him that You stood very high in my Esteem . Indeed Miſs I never recollect to have told you so . Upon my arrival here I found my Sisters in perfect health Mrs- Hunter preparing Caps & Frocks for a Young Gentleman or Young Lady which is to make its appearance in a few Months -- I have seen Miſs L—— . The meeting was unexpected & for the tenth part of a Minute I felt more ridiculo us than ever I had done in my Life . Wheth er she saw it or not I can not tell , howev er I was received with an appearance of regard which I confeſs pleased me greatly . She is a most amiable Girl . I wish you knew her , tho ' there is no probability of my being the person to introduce you to her , if I ever am it will be one of the happiest day s in my Life . Adieu . My affectionate Wishes ever attend You N—— The D. of Atholl has declared himself a Candidate at our Election which is to be the 17 th . of next Month -- Ld .
