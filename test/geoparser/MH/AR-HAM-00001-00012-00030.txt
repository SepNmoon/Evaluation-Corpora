Caldas . June 26 th . 1781 -- My dear Miſs Hamilton , Your Letter to Mrs Feilding fell into my hands , from Mrs Feilding s being unfortunately sail 'd from Lisbon , but 36 hours before Mr. Feilding arrived there , you may imagine rejoiced & surprised as we were to ſee him at Caldes ( where he came on immediately , ) our Disappointment & Regret about her absence , counterbalanced the Satisfaction it would otherwise have afforded us , & I have no Comfort about it , but that She must remain ignorant of it during her Paſsage , at the End of which ( please God She performs it safely , ) she will meet I hope with many Comforts at home , to take off her Thoughts in some Measure from this unlucky Contre temps . I wrote you no Letter by her , as She could give you so much a clearer Account of us by word of Mouth , but determin 'd to take the first opportunity afterwards , of thanking you for all your tender and kind Anxiety & Expreſ sions about my Distreſses . I thank God they are greatly relieved , by Seeing my Son restored , & I hope in a way to be perfectly so in time , but much still remains to be done , as I dare say Mrs Feilding wil have inform 'd you . The Waters here are said to be very efficacious , he has now for Six Days been very regular in drinking them , but it requires near as many Weeks to make a trial of their efficacy , & for that we must wait before we can determine on what steps to take with regard to our future Motions . Your first Letter to Falmouth was received , but the other you mention , ( from which I am sure I shd have received infinite Pleasure , ) I have expected in vain , & fear now , it will never reach me , so pray make me amends as soon as you can . You must believe , added to the pleasure any Letter of yours must give me , it is impoſsible I should not feel infinitely anxious to hear all I can , of the Interesting Scenes in which you are engaged , indeed no Circumstance can be trifling that regards those one Loves & Honours , as I do those you are surrounded with , & these Sensations in me are increas 'd , by a Distance & Absence I never cease to regret . It is impoſsible for me to expreſs what I felt at reading the Paragraph in your Letter concerning the dear Prince of Wales 's Gracious & Affectionate Meſsage to me , if I could love him better than I have always done , I certainly shd , & I beg you will make use of such Expreſsions from me to him , as will best convey the Gratitude & Affection of my Heart , united with that Respect I owe him . I suppose you are all by this time settled at Windsor ; how differently my dear Miſs Hamilton are you & I situated , to what we were last Year at this time roving about on the Suſsex Downs with our little Roy People . nothing is so striking to me , as our Ignorance of the future , & surely we have not a greater Proof that Providence that ordains all things for our happineſs & peace of Mind , for how would the certainty of any Approaching Evil , darken the brightest Scenes & Extinguish all the powers of Enjoyment . Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton & believe me now & ever Most Affly . & Faithfully Yrs . CFinch I can not quite close my Letter without adding a few Lines concerning the Friendly behaviour of Mr Graham to my Son on his illneſs , & to us ever since we have been here , & the infinite Satisfaction I felt from Mrs Feilding s having made her Voyage back with him & Mrs Graham , with whom She is quite charm 'd , & who from the little I could ſee of her , & all I hear , is of a most pleasing engaging Character . I have wrote to Miſs Goldsworthy by this same opportunity -- To Miſs Hamilton
