28 , S t . Albans Street 9 th . June 1800 . My Dear Sister , I can aſsure You that I am in perfect peace with You , and all Mankind , on the score of Letter Writing ; and I am really sorry that your Conscience should have been so troublesome , as to have made You write to Me now , as it will be no longer in my power to put this aſsertion beyond all doubt . My plan was , to have paſsed a Night at your House , and another with Arch . Cathcart , if poſsible , o i n my way home . But , I had determined to inform neither of You of my intention , until l the fulfilling of it was certain . That depends on the Motions of Parliament . A great Minister told me ten days ago , that the Prorogation would take place , on the 18 th . Inst . . But , the busineſs now remaining to be concluded convinces me , that we can not be dismiſsed before the beginning of next Month . If I am right , it will be utterly impoſsible for Me to halt one moment on my Northern Journey . My Son s holidays begin the 18 th - He waits for my taking him home , and I have a point of moment to carry with him . A few Months ago , he announced to Me , his desire of going to Sea . I wondered at his choice , but consented to it , and have arranged with Sir John Warren , to send him to Sir John 's Ship , next Spring . Ten days ago , Mr- Dundas made me a Voluntary offer of sending my Son to India , with the view of putting him in the way of repairing the worn out Fortune of our Family . I felt the full force of Mr. D . s goodneſs ; but the acceptance , must depend on my Son himself . To counsel and advise , I shall always be ready ; but to thwart natural genius , or to force my Children to enter into a line of Profeſsion , to which , they do not feel inclined , I never can bring myself . Dundas has behaved like a true friend . He says , “ if your eldest “ Son wo n't go to India , I will send “ any of your younger Sons who may “ like it better -- ” This is very flattering ; but , my second Son is only Seven Years old . I have written to William mentioning the Offer ; desiring to know whether he has positively fixed on the Navy for his profeſsion , or whether he does not think , that by going to India , he may sooner become an Independant Man , than by trusting to the chance of Prize Money . I have not preſsed him to decide . I have only begged to know his present Sentiments , without disguise . My wish is , to be the friend of my Children , not their dread . William 's answer may poſsibly arrive in a day , or two . My anxiety , I leave You to gueſs at . My coming to Town , Spring , was entirely owing to the Important subject of the Union with the Ireland . The doing so was by no means convenient , my Income being leſsened upwards of £300 pr- An . by the reduction of the Regiment I served in , as Lt Colonel . Since I did come up , I have vented my Spite on You Ladies , by voting for ( what goes by the name of ) the Adultery Bill . I know not your sentiments on that subject . In opposition to mine of course . Give my love and best wishes to Mr. Dickenson , and my Pet Louisa , and I beg You will not forget my Civilities to my Countrywoman . Adieu My Dear Sister , Ever Your sincere friend and affectionate Brother Napier How You found out that I was in London , I can not gueſs .
