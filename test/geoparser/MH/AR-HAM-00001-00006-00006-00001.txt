Do not impute it to any neglect of mine My Dear Miſs Hamilton your not having heared from me ; I never received your note till this day when I came to the Adelphi where it Lay ever since ; and where I have not been before this six weeks . I was again with Mrs : Montagu , and very happy I was indeed ; for she is a charming Mistreſs of her house . will You believe when I tell you that I Danced at two Balls at Sandleford ? Yes I did and performed my part very well . My partner was the Master of the feast at the Harvest-home , a jolly old framer , who never Danced before in his life . Think of my Bold undertaking ; but it afforded a most mirthful Scene to the Company , and to my poor hands plenty of blue spots . Miſs More was not at Sandleford , the Primate of Ireland was expected , and there were no Spare rooms left . Since my return to Hampton , I have dined twice with Mrs : Walsingham , who asked much after you ; but particularly if you were married : I told her that it would not be till after Christms- . have I said right ? will not that be the time ? is your dear mind at rest ? I hope all goes on as You c ould wish . I love you most Sincerely , Your welfare is therefore nearest at my heart ! and that , which must make you happy , I most devoutly wish may be soon accomplished . I had almost forgot to talk to You about , that abominable book Les sent Nouvelles & c -- I give you my word and honor that I never looked into them when they were sent to you ; but when I saw your note , I had the curiosity to see what offended you in them . I was shocked to Death with seeing the pictures only , without reading the Stories . you must have thought me rude to let such a book go out of my house ; but I am sorry they are in it , as such books would make me rather sick then merry if I were obliged to read them . Adieu ! and believe me to be Your most faithful M : Garrick Adelphi Novr . the 2 d : 1784 I will send this to your house as I do not know where you may be by this time . To Miſs Hamilton at her Grace the Dutcheſs of Portland s Bulstrode Near Gerrards Croſs Bucks
