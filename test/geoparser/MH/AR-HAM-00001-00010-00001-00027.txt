My Dear Miranda How agreeably did you deceive me with your welcome Billet -- others deceive to injure , but you to please -- I am as much indebted to you as if you had sent the Book I was so troublesome for -- besides it was a Satisfaction to send to you only , as I have been indulged by a Note in consequence . I own for a moment . I was fearful I should not have been able to read your disjoined Paper -- I am grateful for the kind offer of Rollin from our Leonidas -- I am so much pleased with his Poem that I am impatient to be acquainted with the Heroes of the Athenaid -- when shall we enjoy That together ? Caterina says Miranda expects a Note from me that is a motive with me to write this -- shall it be such with you to excuse its dullneſs -- in wha t new Words shall I expreſs -- how much I love how greatly I esteem Miranda Miss Hamilton James Street Westminster
