Sunday 12 th - 1790 Buxton My dear Mary I have spent an uncomfortable day as I can not get my Father to speak to me on this Subject -- Not poſseſsing much Sensibility himself he can not judge how cruelly he acts in trifling with other 's -- he hates to argue upon a Subject & is now playing the same game as when we were in Jeopardy -- Money unfortunately is of t oo precious a Quality in my Father s Eyes & between ourselves to a rich Jew or Jeweſs he would have married us all -- Seeing that we are all for this Connection he is reduced to a dilemma & I am surprised that he is not gone to Birch he has avoided my looks all day & to prevent my speaking to him he has been poring his Eyes out in a book of some sort -- several times I wished to speak to him this morning when I was always interrupted by some Fool or other & I determined upon a conversation immediately after dinner , when he set off to Church & from there went home with Mrs. Longden -- Consent he must & will in time -- Pray tell Eliza if you think proper that I mean to propose to Mr. D . to give Cr . upon ye- marriage 1500 £ , one thousand of which /that in yr- Uncle s hands I will transfer to Cr . & join with my Father in a Bond for 500 £ , if that sum can not be immediately raised -- As She knows our Situation -- I hope She wd . be satisfied with it -- I wish I could tell him what Cr . 's fortune is & what he would settle upon her -- I wd . not have him come here , for in our present humour we shd . not be civil or escape thro ' the back Door -- If Cr . ( of whom & his Connections we certainly know but little ) will be properly communicate , He can not wish to have a warmer friend than he will find me to be -- I would have taken a Chaise and flown to you if I could have brought on a conversation this morng And my heart rebels , when I must forbid you to come to the Arms of your Husband -- Sarah only wanted a knowled ge of herself to have behaved always in such a manner as to deserve yr- warmest Affections & tho it is a painful leſson , She now sees her er ror in idolizing an Object -- not quite deserving of that unbounded degree of affectn -- If you can gain the intelligence I want , send to me in ye- morning -- I took pains in drying the Wafer of my last -- Hang Peggy ! give her a months notice -- If I had been at home I would have turned her out of doors -- Mrs. Chetham will make enquiries for a Cook for us -- I have recd . Dr. Hall 's Letter to day -- he advises a continuance of the use use of the Bath & he 's sent me two prescriptions which I shall take , thō I am almost well without them -- to day I had no pain & feel very little uneasineſs , in 2 or 3 days I expect to be quite well again & restored to the Arms of the best Wife in the World -- God bleſs you -- pray give my Love to nostro Fratello & his Dulcinea del Toboso To Sarah Louisa & c -- J . D -- I wrote part of this before Timothy came & meant to sen d it by ye- Joiner Mrs. Dickenson
