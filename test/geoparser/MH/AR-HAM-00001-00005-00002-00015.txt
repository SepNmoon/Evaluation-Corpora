KenWood Janry : 6 th : 1789 I have waited for an opportunity of getting a Frank My Dearest Madam , or should not have been so many Days in returning thanks for your kind Letter , & expreſsing my Joy at the good account it contained of those most dear to you , I am exceeding glad that Miss A Murray has found a Remedy for his troublesome complaint , & hope the Soap Pills will keep off any return of it ; I can easily conceive your little Girl grows every Day more & more amusing & engaging , Children of understanding , are at her Age delightful to all , how much more to their affectionate Parents ! who besides the Love & regard for them , have constant opportunities of observing all their little enchanting ways , & how wonderfully their young Minds open . I am much Obliged to you for your kind congratulations on our dearest Mr. Dickenson 's recovery , which thank God was to the satisfaction of all who attended her , & as quick as could be wished , Elizth : , for that is the name of the youngest Child , I am told is a very fine one , & thrives fast , sweet Anna Maria is in perfect health , & chatters away like your 's . Towards the end of Octor : our dear Louisa was seized with a disorder in his Stomach , which pulled him so much that we began to dread the consequences , but to our unspeakable Joy & amazement he is better now than before that time , his Constitution seems to have taken a turn , he has left off Laudanum , & Sleeps well without it , takes no Medicines of any sort , except from time to time a small quantity of Rhubarb , Eats very tolerably , has little or nothing of those dreadful irritations , can enter into conversation , & listen to reading , the only difference for the worse is a degree of weakneſs in the Limbs which prevents his rising from his Chair , or walking when up , without some aſsistance he Dines alone , & has not yet help 'd himself from the great stiffneſs of his arms ; he has kept constantly up Stairs in an apartment to the South , & really has suffered as little from the intense cold of this Winter , as any one in the House , far leſs than my poor Sister , who tho ' she never goes out , is seldom without pain in Head or Stomach , thank God I hitherto brave all Weather , & unleſs when Snow is falling , never miſs a charming Walk in Wood or Garden . The Publick Calamity is too dreadful a Subject to dwell upon , nor can any one think on the private distreſs it also occasions , without the greatest commiseration for the unhappy sufferers , the Politicks are too intricate for my discernment , but I heartily joyn with you in wishing the steps taken , may tend to the good of the whole , for there we are all parties concerned . I suppose Ld Mansfield would tell you that her dear Ly Stormont has lately recover 'd from the Measles , which he had most favourably , the other Boys are all well , & she is now enjoying the Company of her beloved William at Little Grove . Mrs Graham is pretty well , but in distreſs at present on account of her youngest Sister , who is very ill at Dallington . I am much Obliged to you for a sight of the inclosed , it is a curious Manuscript , & the place belonging to Ly Cathcart must by your description be a very pretty one , so extensive a Forrest , & so many beautiful Ridings can not fail of having a good effect . Adieu My Dearest Madam , I am charged by Mr Ironmonger & my Sister to offer their best & kindest wishes to you & Lord M . , who I hope will accept the same from me , & that you will believe me , most sincerely , & Affectionately Your 's . Mr Dickenson PS Twenty kiſses to your sweet Girl .
