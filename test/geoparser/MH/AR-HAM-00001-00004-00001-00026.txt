Dear Miſs Hamilton , The reason of your leaving Town so suddenly makes all apologies unneceſsary . We are all rejoiced to hear of Lady Wake 's recovery , but not quite so much so at the plan you have mention 'd of being separated from your Friends here , for the greatest part of the summer . I conclude Miſs Clark has informed you of the death of poor Lady Ann Greville ; she was seiz 'd with an inflammation of the lungs , which put an end to her existence last Monday after an illneſs of 7 or 8 days . I was with Lady Warwick at the time of the fatal event , she thought her better that day than on Sunday . & she had been speaking of me with great sensibility for my attention to her , as I had visited her three or four times during her illneſs at her desire ; she behaved with great fortitude for tho ' perfectly sensible of her approaching diſsolution , she conversed with ease , as far as her faultering voice woud permit , & frequently joked ; she cou 'd not bear the sight of grave faces , or the expreſsion of any kind of anxiety on her account ; for which reason Lady Warwick 's company was leſs agreeable to her than any other Persons ; when I left her Room on Sunday , Gen . Clerk succeeded me with Pope 's Homer which she made him read & & she listned to it with the greatest earnestneſs ; trivial conversations she said did not keep up her attention , but that she was highly interested in the heroic exploits of Achilles . She left a very singular Will , very spirited & quite in character . I shall mention but one particular at present which is a legacy of £500 . & all her cloaths & many other things to her maid , who has been with her near ten years . She is to be interr 'd at Warwick to which place her corpse was sent this morning . My Son arrived from Geneva ten days ago , improved in stature , but in no other respect . I had concluded every thing with Mr. Burrows for his taking him under his care , but on further consideration have thought it advisable to lay aside that plan , which I am sure wou 'd not have answer 'd well for either party . I am as yet undecided how I shall dispose of him . I have made my Apologies to Mr. Burrows , giving some of my reasons for my change of sentiment ; in such a case where the judgement must be satisfied , there is no room for Compts . This is the third day of inceſsant rain & I perceive the wind is now completely settled in the west , so that we may soon expect warm weather . I might have mention 'd to you that Ly . Ann Greville 's death is attended with a circumstance of consolation to poor Lord Warwick for he gains £500 pr . An by it , & all demands upon him on her account are now completely cancell 'd ; he had a saving of £100 , five months ago by the death of Mr. Patoun You give me an example of punctuality . Our account stands thus I have received of the £600 for which you have my Bond the Sums in the order following -- if I shou 'd have forgot any other sum receiv 'd it shall be rectified £190 . -- . -- 350 . -- . -- Interest due by me . . . . 25 .
