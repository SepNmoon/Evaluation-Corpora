Edinburgh 16 th . October 1780 I have often heard that patience tho ' a Virtue is never found in a female -- Your letter of the 7 th - inst : is a strong proof of the justice of this observation -- You accuse me of not chusing to answer your letter of the 18 th - of last Month , but I have a much better right to abuse you for not writing to me before the 18 th - of Septr as I wrote you of my intention of leaving Quarters on the 20 th - of Septr , & as I fulfilled that intention you have not the smallest title to blame me . If you ask pardon in a very submiſsive manner & if I happen to be in a very gracious mood when I receive your apology perhaps I may forgive you . It is now time to tell you that I received this Letter of the 18 th . after my arrival here , & that I not only answered it but likewise wrote to Mr- Farhill in obedience to your commands . Tomorrow I go to Holyroodhouse to vote for our sixteen representatives , & am sorry to tell you that there will be no opposition . The Earls of Breadalbane & Bute retire . The D. of Atholl & the E. of Glencairn succeed them , so that I shall have no opportunity of distinguishing myself as a Patriot . After the Election the right honorables dine together , & in the Evening those who do n't amuse themselves with the Battle will make their appearance at an Aſsembly . I go to the Aſsembly & take my Miſs Harriot with me . My adorable will not be there , as she is aſsisting her Cousin Lady Margaret Carnegy to prepare for her Nuptials which are to take place next Thursday . Mr- Watson the intended Husband of L. M. C . is a Cousin German of my Father s . I congratulate you upon Cornwallis 's succeſs . A few such spirited and soldierlike exertions would soon give a turn to the American affairs . The Parliament will probably meet the K—— in good humour , a circumstance which could not have been expected had not this fortunate peice of news arrived in such good time . Adieu for the present . I shall attempt to get a frank for you tomorrow & give you an account of anything extraordinary which may happen at the Election . 18 th : October 1780 The election yesterday was conducted with leſs confusion than I expected . The D. of A . appeared perfectly insensible of the honor conferred upon him , however he gave me some franks this morning , which was more than I expected -- Lord & Lady Cathcart are expected here this day . They arrived at Cork some little time ago & wrote to Charles Brown that they would be here instantly . Adieu . Beleive me ever Your very Affect- Brother N—— I had almost forgot to tell you that I Danced all last Night with Lady Eliz . Cunningham , Ld- Glencairn 's Sister . This peice of intelligence you may think of no importance , but it is an astonishing proof of my good humour , as there is nothing I detest so much -- Walshingham Walingham Walsingham
