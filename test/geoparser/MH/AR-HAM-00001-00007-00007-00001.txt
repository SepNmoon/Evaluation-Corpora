Dover Street 23 July 1781 my Dear Willm King it has given us , very real concern to hear of Your illneſs ; and tho ' Your letter aſsured me , You was got well ; Yet am anxious to hear You continue so , for nervous complaints are very bad to get rid of : especialy this Hot Weather ; could say a great deal more , but am not clear , if You shew letters ; some people do , and in that case I would not enter too deeply in Your case , for fear I might be suposed a Quack & c & c. . . . . . . . . . I shall hope for a letter in the course of the next week directed to me at Weymouth , Dorset . as we set out for that place next Wednesday , but as invalids , and travelling with our own horses , we intend to make Easy days and sunday coming in the way shall Stop for that at Dorchester and visit a friend by which we shall not arrive at Weymouth till Monday : where we shall most likely rest a fortnight and then proceed to Yarty in Devonshire , my Mother s Joynture House , that has been left to the Sprights and Goblins in which that country abounds , these thirty Year so a dismal old Mansion among the Hills -- but notwithstanding , if we are all well shall paſs our time agreably as nothing is more conducive to that than good Humor , which we intend to take of the party : but will not anticipate as I intend to send You particulars , and if the Ghosts were troublesome & c & c .. I have the pleasure to inform You , my Mother is got very stout again , a proof , She went to Hillingdon to dine with Miſs Hamilton last Thursday ; which is 15 mile off ; and the next day , we went to Lady Elize : Worsley 's , in Smalbury Green ; and believe , we saw the Princeſs Royal go to Windsor , I look 'd hard to catch a glimpse of You , but in vain it was too far to see . as she bore the fatigue of it without any inconvenience flatter myself the Journey will not be too much . my Sister I fear will find it a good deal : but as change of Air is very restorative we hope it will be of service to her . how clever it would be , could You make one of the party ! I was not a little surprised to find Sir Joseph Banks had been to Windsor ; and asked if it was not extraordinary ? but was told , not at all , for the officers might ask who they pleas : d : I own it surprised me but tho ' I had Yr letter said nothing , more , as they seemed so well satisfied but it seems extraordinary -- I have been out of town for two or three days with Mr. Leland and spent my time very agreably , one day we went to Old Windsor , where we went on board the Galatee Barge , and sail 'd down to Isleworth 25 mile : another d ay we went of a fishing party , to a Gentlemans h t o ca tch Eels , of which a pond was so full we were told that were seen , as large as a Mans Arm : in consequence of this , we went loaded with fishing tackle , sufficient to Catch , all the fish in that pond , and the next : but , as those parties always turn out croſs , the morning proved whet , and tho ' the Evening was fine the fish would not bite ; when , the Gentlemen out of patience , flung in the net , and dragged : but met with the usual fate , nothing but weeds ! and not a fish to speak of . for my part , I was very well entertained , and not mortified about the disapointment , as I am no fisher ; and it is a charming House , filled with fine pictures & variety of Virtū which was too great an Amusement , to regret the other -- I can not conclude this , without enquiring after Ly . Banks who I hope is quite recover 'd , and able to retake her usual attendance , for tho , I have no doubt , my agreable friend will Shine , in that department ; as well as in every other She undertakes , yet I wish her to have leſs attendance ( if poſsible ) in order to regain her Health , and Spirits -- my mother , and Sister , bid me say , how much they feel obliged , for Your kind enquiries ; and joyn with me , in best wishes , for Your Health and Happineſs : and hope , You will very soon , take up Your pen : which always gives great pleasure to dear Miſs Planta s Sincere friend Miſs Hamilton Wil : King Queens Lodge Windsor
