Burlington Street 18 th June 1789 . Dear Sir , I am extremely sorry to hear from you that you are obliged to go to Bath for the benefit of the Waters , which I hope will agree with you ; should they do otherwise most likely you will not remain there , and if you like to come and stay with me at Richmond , I shall be very glad of your Company -- I have had many months trouble with the Petition , which is now likely to be ended with our obtaining the Right of Voting only , as the Committee seem tired of us -- His Grace & myself go on very pleasantly together , and the more so , as I have adhered to the plan of detaching myself from a dinner party , as much as poſsible , as I found it was very hurtful to my busineſs , and took up too much of my time . I think that he will go into the North the beginning of August . You mention that Mrs. Dickenson has not heard from Nanny lately . I can tell you that she still continues so absurdly a Slave to Madneſs & Folly , that I give her up as to any dependance . The Children broke up yesterday for the Holidays , and are now at Richmond where you may be aſsured that I shall be as much as poſsible -- Nanny wishes to be sometime with me , but as I know that those two Devil Sister 's worry her , I reply that whenever it is agreeable for her to come , I shall be glad to see her -- at the same time after her conduct last Summer , I will never make any engagement the durance whereof , shall depend upon her . I am no great advocate for the present Tontine , but if you think Louisa will live till 80 she may benefit by it , and if you approve thereof I will get you a Hundred , you can not put more on her life , and as to Mrs. Dickenson 's or your own , I do n't think they will Answer . I hardly conceive that there will be any diſsolution of Parliament this Year , and therefore I hope for some quiet -- His Majesty by all accounts , is now in a better state of health than ever , and takes care of himself -- as to the rest of the Royal Produce , I have a very indifferent opinion of ; and as to the Duel between Col. Lenox & his Highneſs of York , I think it is a very good leſson for Princes , and they now have been given to understand that they must not insult , the gentlemen of this Country with impunity . Henry is quite recovered , and Fanny s neck under the care of Dr. Higgins has every prospect of doing well without a scar . I will make Katherine write to Mrs. Dickenson very soon I shall expect to hear from you as soon as you can . I am Dear Sir , your very obed Servt . John Jackson Mr. Jackson London 1789
