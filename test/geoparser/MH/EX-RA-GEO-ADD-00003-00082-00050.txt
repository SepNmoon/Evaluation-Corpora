14 th - Octbr . 1779 Thursday Morng My ever dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , my Miranda , Think only what I must feel , were ever ye . slightest imputation thrown upon yr . Character , yr . honor is dearer to me than my own , there is nothing upon earth that I wld .. not sooner undergo than see you uneasy upon yt . account . I am now talking in ye . language of a Brother to a Sister , you know my Miranda yt . you are dearer to me than life itself , therefore judge of my feelings by yr . own . Yr . wishes construe themselves in my ideas into Commands accordinly I have again ſpoke to my M——r only to attend you on S——ys & Th-ys . when he brings you ye . N—— Your amiable , tender , & commiserating heart will be happy to hear yt .. our chace was so agreable to us , especially as ye . life of ye poor Animal was again saved . No accident to me tho ' I rode as hard as any body could well do , ye . only fall yt .. I saw w ll as Lt .. Col. L——ke whose Horse having overreached , pitched over & roled over & over him , but by a great mercy he received no sort of hurt , not even ye . most trifling bruise . I have observed my promise , my Miranda of being as little as poſsible with ye . Servants , & of keeping low Company off from me when hunting so much so yt .. my dear Father commended me strongly for it , especially for ye . propriety of my conduct in yt . instance , which he seldom does upon occasion , howeve r this pleased him so much , yt . he cld .. not help testifying it to me . I understand my dearest Miranda , yt . I go to W——r again on M——y to dinner in order to hunt on T——y & so come back as I did this time on ye W——y ; & then on ye .

Terraſs , & conversing with you , I will avoid them , but as to every little attention , when we are at home of an Evening , such as sitting by you & conversing with you & treating you with gaiety , & spirits , & a certain degree of polite familiarity , my friendship , & my affection for you as well as my gratitude to you , will never be able to restrain themselves from these liberties which constitute a part of true friendship . Believe me my true friend when I aſsure you yt . I will to ye . best of my endeavours try to cure myſelf , of yt . wicked , vile , low practice of swearing , I am but too conscious yt . you heard la me frequently guilty of it ye . last time we met , but it was involuntarily because it is grown quite habitual to me , so yt whenever I am ye . least warmed , I can not help expreſsing myſelf in a manner unbecoming me , however I repeat it again I will do my utmost to cure myself of it . Pray my Miranda ye . next time we meet wh : will now be soon let me see your charming spirits themselves , & let me feel them , however let yr . friendship biaſs you so much as to let me always perceive yt .. you treat me with yt .. sympathetick tenderneſs & affection , which you dearest Sister shall ever find in ye breast of , Yr . ever affectionate Brother Palemon toujours de même , P.S . My Mother does not chuse I shd .. have a Velvet now for she says I have e nough of ym .. in a year , therefore am sorry I have given you so much trouble about those paterns however I shall take ye liberty of sending you some of some other sorts of stuffs , & of begging you to
