Canterbury Novr . 8 th 1772 To shew My dearest Girl , what pleaſure I always receive from her Correspondance I never let one post paſs without writing her after getting hers . Last night My dearest Mary brought me yours without a date so can not ſay whither it came in course of Post or not , however it made me very happy to find you & Mrs Hamilton quite recovered from your late indispoſitions & its my most ſincere Prayer & Wish that you may continue only as well as I wish you that , with the aſsurance you give me of the continuance of your Friendship will always make me happy & believe me I prize that Friendship together with your Correspondance much more than I am able to discribe but as I am now quite convinced that it is ſincerely returned your own feelings will be the best guide to find out my meaning as there is ſome times a ſome thing within one , that makes known to one , what they neither can tell , write or discribe clearly to another person , have you never felt that ſame ſome thing wh- you absolutely could not discribe pray tell me in your next . I hope you have , as I would have all my Friends feel the same ſensations I do , especially when I feel them give me ſuch infinite pleaſure as ſome of them does , & I can aſsure you My dearest Mary none more than the above one -- your Correspondance My dearest Girl has made me do a thing I never thought could have happened to me Viz . to court one of your fashionable Patriots ( as I have a thorough detestation of them all ) look at the Frank this comes in being run out I was obliged to beg a G en tleman to get me a dozen from Mr Alderman S awbridge had it been Wilkes or even the D——l I would have applied from frank , rather than not had ſome for you , so you see my Friendship for you has absolutely changed my Nature You deſire my dear Mary to know what is the reason that Friendship when so rational a Pleaſure is so very seldom found The reason My dear Girl is very plain , we are a Sett of very selfish Creatures , at first a paſsion rises that we call Friendship between Man & Man or Woman & Woman that continues till ſome little trifling affair comes into play that concerns both , each thinks the other ought to give up & dear self makes a breach in their minds that blotts out a regard which they called Friendſhip & com̄only makes them enemy 's to each other for the future , Jealousy in our Case , Envy in yours often puts an end to that thing com̄only called Friendſhip likeways , that between Man & Woman is I believe the one that lasts longest tho if you 'll believe ſome people there is none that can subſist between them , as Friendſhip with Woman is Sister to Love whither that be true or not , is not the point , but even allow it to be so , one thing is certain that without Love and regard there can be neither Love nor Friendſhip between the ſame or the different Sexes & both Love & Friendſhip must be quite a drug , unleſs you can banish self entirely as its impoſsible they can subſist in my humble opinion together -- tell me My dear Girl whither you agree with me or not in your next , as I willingly would shew you that I have both Love & Friendship for you , by giving up my own opinion to you , should we differ , as I am quite perswaded you could give me so just & strong reasons for your opinion , that together with my great inclination to be always on your ſide must be convincing It gives me great pleasure to find you have wrote your Uncle Cathcart as for Sir Wm Hamilton s destination I have never heard any more of it than what I have wrote you , if I do you may be ſure I shall let you know . -- Many thanks to My dearest Mary for her sending me her Latin Mr advice concerning my health but I am afraid was I to try it , the cure might prove worse than the decease as giving up port Wine which is the only kind I can drink with any kind of Pleaſure , might bring the Gout into my Stomach & I am ordered to drink so much every day both by my Edinr Phiſicians & those in this place -- now My dear Girl I will refer to you whither its not better to have a little of an Asthmatical complaint than the Gout in any of the noble parts , ſuch as the Head & Stomach I believe you 'll agree with me the first is best , your experience by attending your Father My dear Mary must tell you what the Gout is , as he was greatly afflicted with it . I have not read Sir Wm H : observations on Mount Vesuvius , indeed I have not time to read when with the Regiment , so many people coming constantly in to me breaks off the thread of ones reading The year I am from the Regt is my year for reading I suppose I have been interrupted at least twenty times ſince I began this letter so you may eaſily judge whither it would be poſsible to read or not . -- what I wrote to you My dearest Mary was only a hint not to touch upon Characters to many people only to those that you are ſure off so I beg you 'll go on to me as I like greatly to hear your sentiments fully on every subject as you judge so very justly on every subject that I get great knowledge from you thinking on paper to me I can write no more so many people is speaking in my room , but must ſay I wish Sir Wm & Lady Wake had stay 'd at home ſince it deprived me of a longer letter from you Please my best respects to Mrs Hamilton & believe me to be My dearest Mary Yours most faithfully & most affctly yours Wm N——
