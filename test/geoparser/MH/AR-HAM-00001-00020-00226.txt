71 , Queen Street 2 d . Septr- 1808 My Dear Sister , It requires no share of second Sight to discover why You dont right write , when You ought to do so . Your known & incurable Indolence will furnish a full answer to your question . But , pray observe that I never find fault with You , about writing . For , there is Justice enough , in my composition , to lead me to excuse in others , what I am frequently apt to be guilty of myself . Now , Madam , for your prediction . It may relate to the French Revolution , and , it may not have any connexion with it . “ A captive King humbled ” can not mean the King of France , for he is no Captive . The Black Eagle can not mean the despicable King of Pruſsia , Austria , is more likely to be intended by that sign . The Lion of Leon is purple . May not purple be considered as black . Allowing these two points , then the Prediction will import , that the Infamous Napoleon is to be demolished , by Spain & Austria . The captive King humbled , is Ferdinand 7th- ; humbled , by having been forced to resign his pretensions to the Crown of Spain ; restored by the Patriotism of the Spaniards . All which , is just as plain , as the Prophecy itself . Brunswic 's Lion is . Blue . My Wife & I have been remarkably frisky this Summer , having made a three Weeks Tour in the Highlands , visiting the Trosachs , Loch Earn , Duneira , Ochtertyne & c. & c. & c. No sooner did we return from that excursion , than off I set , with my two Boys , and made another Tour for three Weeks in Roxburghshire & Selkirkshire , introducing them to Thirlestane , the ancient Seat of their Forefathers , S t - Mary 's Loch , Melrose & Dryburgh Abbies , & c. & c. & c. During this last excursion , I received an unexpected peice of Intelligence , Arriving at a Gentleman 's House , He asked very particularly after my Eldest Son , & on my replying that I had not heard of him for some Months , he bluntly said “ then You dont know , “ that he is a Prisoner -- ” He confirmed the fact , by desiring his Son to shew me a Letter he had received from my William , dated Ivica 1 st . of May . This rather disconcerted me , though the certainty that he must have been released before I knew of his captivity , was some comfort to me . Now , all my uneasineſs about him is over , having received a Letter from himself dated Gibraltar 14 th . July , where he had arrived in perfect health two days before . I am still ignorant of the cause , or manner of his having been taken , as the Letters he wrote to me through Spain , and Barbary , have not yet reached me . My second Boy Francis , sailed with the Expedition under Sir Arthur Wellesley . We have ha d two Letters from him , since he left Cork , and are daily expecting some accounts of the landing of the Troops from him , as we know from another source , that he was employed debarking them on the first of August . As the Brothers are now near one another , I trust , they may have the good fortune to meet . My Sister Henrietta is well . I shall tell her of your enquiries after her . She can have but little personal recollection of You , as it is not yesterday since she saw You at Northampton . As Maiden Ladies , of a certain time of Life , are not fond of being reminded of Occurrences long paſsed , it might be dangerous to hint that She had ever seen You , were it not , that her Memory has been frequently refreshed on that subject , by my having done You the honour of talking of You . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Give my Love to Your Husband & Daughter , and My Lady 's civilities to them both . You may make a formal Compliment to Louisa 's Grandpapa , if you please . My Countrywoman 's Letter has been forwarded . Ever your faithful Friend & Affecte- Brother Napier Edinburgh , Second September 1808 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
