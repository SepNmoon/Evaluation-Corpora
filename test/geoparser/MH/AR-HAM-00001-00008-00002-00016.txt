Wing -- Leighton Buzzard -- May 10 th - My dearest Mrs Dickenson We are all much obliged to you , for the kind Letter you wrote to us . & are very impatient for a repetition of the same treat . but I have now a great favor to beg of you . & that is -- as you see a great deal of Lord & Lady Cremorne . you will get them to inform you of the real state of Ireland . the Accounts in the Publick papers are tremendous . on the other hand some people say that they hope matters will not come to extremities , & that Government will get the better -- I am afraid to write again -- so are my Sisters , for this reason -- we might hazard an opinion -- or they might interpret something -- into an opinion -- we have no reason to doubt the integrity of our Agent . & he has employments under Government . besides being an Army Agent . so that we are in no fear of his writing -- but it will be a great ease to my mind if I can be relieved from this suspense . if it is ever so bad . let me know the worst -- my dear sister dare brook worse than any in the Neighbourhood -- they both absolutely sent me to bed last Night in such an agitation of mind , that in spite of Camphire Julep . I could not sleep for hours . the accounts in the Sun of this 2 d Mutiny , was so very alarming , that and also in its Influence , upon some terrible people within 4 Miles of this place that they sunk my spirits almost to despair -- I culd not have suppos 'd that a Mutiny on board the fleet , could have afforded satisfaction to any ones Soul . but the report that Tho Baily brought from Market was -- that the Baptists were all hiſsing together in the street . & Concluding that a Revolution was very near if not already begun -- but of this take no Notice in yr Answer to me -- this morg my servant told me that the discontents at these taxes are very alarming -- and that a very respectable Partner in the Neighbourhood came here this morg to breakfast , who mention 'd his apprehensions that the People were ready for revolt . his uneasineſs proceeded from the falling of the Stocks . where he has a very good Property I have sent him some Consolation respecting the subject of his particular truble -- but this Man who attends all Fairs & Markets is too good an evidence . of the dispositions of the common people -- we had letters from London yesterday full of the Princeſs Royal & her Wedding . & a pattern of the fashionable Silk for Gowns -- her future Consort slept at Aylsbury one Night last Week he eat Mutton Chops very heartily -- & gave the people at the George great comfort for as they observed he had an Excellent appetite -- also yr Cousin Mansfield s approaching Marriage at 19 was announc 'd . I find these Events occupy the Gay part of the World . Dr de Salis goes to London the latter end of this Month to wait at S t . James 's he takes the first week or fortnight , & will be down the middle of June -- I hope yr visit will not be postpon 'd till after I am obliged to go to my Aunt . who is so kind to me . that notwithstanding my reluctance . to move -- makes it absolutely neceſsary for me to go . indeed I have reason to dread the interview . I have already made Ireland my excuse , for staying so long -- your account of Ly Holderneſs is very extraordinary but the Operation does not surprise me so much . as her waiting at S t . James 's before it took place -- Adieu my dearest Mrs . & Mr. Dickenson . Accept our United & most affect . good wishes to you both . & for the Health & prosperity of dear Louisa -- remember us to every body . & believe me yr ever Affect . & obliged Friend DBloſset -- NB . pray never mind a Frank -- I will give you timely Notice of the Charges , if Ireland sd . make it neceſsary for me to beg -- I have only about £400 out of that Country -- but let me know the worst Single Mrs. Dickinson 58 Lower Brook Street Bond Street London
