As my sweetest friend 's happineſs and peace of mind is my first object , and my greatest , indeed I may say almost my only delight , I readily consent to dissolve , to paſs an act of oblivion over that fatal promise , wch .. if I had known it would have cost you so much pain I never wld .. have asked of you . God grant that you may never have any occasion to make use of it , if you do I am thoroughly resolved not to survive yr . loſs . Think not that this is ye . resolution of a giddy , rash , wild young man it has arisen from the long constant contemplation of a strong & sound mind . You say you once loved a friend who died in ye . bloom of her youth , with enthuastic fondneſs , think then how much stronger the pangs I must feel will be , if ever I am separated from her , which g G od forbid , whom I not only adore love with enthusiastic fondneſs , but doat upon and adore beyond the idea of every thing that is human . Need you have repeated to me that yr . fame was dearer to you than yr . life , did not I tell you once before , that I wld .. sooner go to immediate perdition , than attempt to do any thing that wld .. be detrimental either to yr . reputation , honor , & virtue . I look upon reputation as ye . brightest jewel any woman poſseſses and when they lose that , they lose every thing that denotes them to be Women , if such is my opinion concerning Women in general , you can not suppose that I would even think of doing any thing , I repeat ed it again , that wld .. be detrimental either to the reputation , honor and virtue of her whom I not only love with enthusiastic fondneſs , but whom I doat upon , & adore beyond ye idea of every thing that is human . Bear with me yet once more if I conjure you on my knees not at any time to be too hasty in making use of the release I have given you from that fatal & solemn promise , consider only that my resolution is as fixed as ye . unalterable Book of Fate . I think then if I know you , & if you ever had ye smallest spark of friendly affection for yr . friend , as you say you have , you will put up with not a little , when you know that my happineſs not only in this world , but what is much more serious in the next depends wholly upon it . Let not any reflections my sweetest , dearest , ever amiable friend , of the imprudence , inconsistency , or impropriety of yr . conduct in accepting of my friendship disturb yr . peace & happineſs , or torture yr . mind , as I am convinced they only arise from a too delicate & punctilious honor & as they are now not to be remedied . The promise of an eternal and everlasting continuance of yr . friendship is now ye . only thing that will contribute to heal ye . wound that rankles in my heart . This alone promise alone is sufficient to bring you out of my debt , you never was in it till this moment , upon my consenting to dissolve that fatal promise ; I have been in yrs . till this instant . I thank you cordially for yr . good advice , as it shews the interest you take in what befalls me . I will follow it to ye utmost of my power , make not no more apologies for it I beg of you , for it adds an additional weight to that which now hangs upon my spirits . Let me now see you again enjoy that portion of chearfulneſs natural to your disposition let me again see that happineſs revisit yr . mind , which I am afraid has fled from mine . Else ere soon I flatter myself that the Almighty will call b m e to the throne of his grace , to join yr . now sainted friend in Heaven , there with his Angels & Archangels and with His whole heavenly and bleſsed host , to sing eternal praises unto his holy name . Now adieu my friend , may Heaven pour forth its most greatest bleſsings on thee , & mayest thou for henceforward enjoy that happineſs , which yr . angellick disposition so richly deserves . I am , and ever shall be Yr . sincerely affectionate Friend . P.S . Excuse me if I apologize to you for having demanded at towards ye end of my Letter , a promise of ye constant & eternal continuance of my yr . affection to me . I never thought it was absolutely neceſsary , but I only desired it for my peace of mind , but now that I have reperused over ye end of yr . Letter , which I have since destroyed , I find it is not neceſsary , as my sweetest friend has there given me sufficient aſsurance of her never ceasing friendship and affection . Continue I conjure you in every Letter to give me some good advice , and that without any excuse I. for it hurts my delicacy as I once told you I loved honesty & openneſs . Learn to contemn all praise by times For Flattery 's ye muse of aims . John Gay , Fable I , The Lion , the Tyger and the Traveller ( 1727 ) . Gay . May I presume to ask a favor of my dearest friend , and that is that whatever present she makes me of her hair . it may be not ye setting of it may be quite plain , for it will always be dearer to me than life itself , that on the back of it there may be the day of yr . Birth without yr . dear name and the Year of that event ever so dear to me , with a Motto of yr . own , & on ye front of it the following motto , remember it is to represent especially on that side my sentiments concerning you . “ Toujours aimée ” . Allow me also if it is not hurting too much yr . delicacy , to give you a plain Bracelet to answer to that “ Regretté a jamais ” , in order that it may be yr . constant companion and that you may wear it on the opposite arm always when you wear that , be it only to shew how desirous I am of being related to him tho ' I am not as yet in the manner I aspire to with such ambition , & which is now the sole object of my life . The the Motto 's on that shall be , the front one in hair what you please , on the back the day of the Month on which I was born , & ye year . & the motto “ gravé a jamais dans mon cœur . ” I am afraid in putting myself in yr . place there I speak only according to my desires & not ye tenor of yr . sentiments . Adieu . I beg that y rs ye one motto on yrs . that I have chose may be either “ Toujours aimée ” , or “ Tout ce qui m'est chère au monde ” take wh . you like . Chuse both mine if you like it , only let me know concerning every thing in yr . next . -- Tell me also every thing what you know concerning the future plan concerning W——r throughout ye rest of ye Season , & who is probably to go thither . Adieu encore .
