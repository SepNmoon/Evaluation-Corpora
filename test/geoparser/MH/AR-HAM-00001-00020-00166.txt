House of Lords 5 th - March 1802 . My Dear Sister , I received your most saucy Letter , about an hour ago , which has made my blood boil so violently that I can not persuade myself to wait till I get home , but must give my Venom vent without delay . How could You presume to suppose that I would insult Louisa , so far as to imagine , that she could be sick , when I had seen such evident signs of the return of Ruddy Health in a Countenance , which I should commend , did it not too much resemble Yours . For her own sake , and for Mr. D . s comfort , I rejoice that Dr. Kerr thinks as I do , about her Cough . As to You , whatever gives You pleasure , I could almost detest . How durst You affront my Consequence so much , as to direct your Letter to Portugal Street ? Did you not know that London was a sufficient Addreſs f f o r One of the Sixteen Representatives of The most Illustrious Peerage in The World . The insult is not to be tolerated , and as a punishment , I had almost determined not to tell You that I reside at N o . 4 , Suffolk Street , Charing Croſs . My best affections ever attend Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , & my Countrywoman , while my Wrath , hatred , and abhorrence are likely to be your portion . In the mean time I remain ever My Dear Sister , Your Affecte . Brothe r Napier When I got to Wooburn on Saturday Morning at Eight O'Clock , the people at the George neither knew how the Duke of Bedford did , nor that he was ill , nor that Dr. Kerr had been sent for -- London , Fifth March 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Post Office .
