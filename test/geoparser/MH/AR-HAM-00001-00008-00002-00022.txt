Audley End -- Saffron Walden Janry 9 th 1801 -- My dear Friend , So far are you from being to Blame in giving me your advice concerning my return to Tring -- that I feel my self More obliged to you than I can Expreſs -- I shall certainly adopt it . but that determination must be a Secret at present -- it has also been of further Service to me -- as I could not convince my dear Infatuated Sister -- by any other means than by sending her a Copy of what you so kindly wrote to me -- which I apprise you of -- as I never will ( however neceſsary ) do any thing of that sort without informing the writer -- there was no one thing in that paragraph which reflected in the smallest degree upon my Sister s Conduct , it was therefore safe & that part of yr Letter , & a private intimation of the Wickedneſs of the Man in whom she has plac 'd such a Confidence has at length open 'd her eyes & I trust will be productive of great Advantage to Dr & Mrs. De Salis . I will now trouble you to send for Harry Baily . be so good to give him the Enclos 'd Note -- my first order to him , is to send you one of my Turkey 's & the other to Mrs Vincent No 8 Berkely Square . by the Waggon . be so good to allow Baily to read the Note in your presence & if he can not make it out , be so good to read it to him . as you my dear Mrs Dickenson are the only person to whom I entrusted that Secret Excuse my giving you this trouble -- believe me I would do as much for you -- & do desire Hūtley , some of those people who go about to look out for a Lodging -- or some little Cabin or other where I will put my self til I can get into my House . I will write to Major Gilpin & beg & implore him to Expedite matters with all poſsible dispatch -- I sd think Either Woburn or Ampthill -- or some of those parts such as convenient temporary Habitation may be found after imploring yr forgiveneſs -- I will now to attempt amusing you . but first I must aſsure you how truly sorry I am to find that Mr D : has been so much indispos 'd , into his troublesome complaint . I hope to be able to send a recipe of the famous Dr Freind which has done great Service th ' o to some constitutions it may be too heating . but Sir Francis Milman s remedy is I believe the most certain Cold Water any Morning at first rising -- this Place is as all the world knows very Magnificent , tho Still the Salon , the Source that Slots out what was formerly the Buttery Hall & the Chaple -- are I really think finer than is to see -- was at Warwick Castle -- than here are magnificent buildings & a Column in the Pleasure Ground which are extensive -- a fine river the Cam Meanders thr ' o the Park -- a beautiful Menagerie & pretty flower garden are new tho Have the other at some distance -- to the latter I walk 'd & round the Garden & home again -- at my first arrival I found Miſs Forest Mr Metcalf & Mr Crutchly great friends of Lord Braybrooke s both Members of Parlmt & both had been in Trade -- Metcalf is a great distiller & pays £60 000 pr annum duty -- so you may Judge of his Wealth -- Crutchly more properly descends from Trade , his father was a Brewer his Uncle a Scarlet dyer . Who left him more than one £100 000 . These Men are full Sensible -- & full Vote the right way , that is for Pitt & the Grenvilles -- my good Host is more Aimiable & I believe from my Heart better than any body I have in the World -- but one thing he wants to be perfect ! he has given up to Pity ! what was mean 'd for Mankind . he is intolerant in his Political Principles , & I really think He lets bad News made him ill -- for we were all much alarm 'd the day before Yesterday -- but Thank god without a Cause . Of Course I can send you no information respecting Politicks the Papers will record all we hear upon that Subject -- Lord B : has Six Children at home , I think his Eldest daughter the most extraordinary , Young Woman I ever yet met with -- she is Pretty in her person lively , Gay & Youthfull at the same Time has the most serious way of thinking she is very religious , her mornings are occupied in visiting the Sick , & the needy , in the management of this large Establishment she is peculiarly clever , she is at this moment gone to pray by a poor man who has work 'd 41 years in this Garden . & is now dying -- the Chaplain being from home she lost no Time in giving her aſsistance -- I must Tell you a pretty Episode -- about Ten days or more since -- she met a Young Girl in rags begging -- she ask 'd her many questions which she Answer 'd & told her that She was an Orphan Girl without Father or Mother . she also told her where she resided . Miſs Neville sent to the Parish , received a very impartial account , & the Girl had spoke the truth as to her destitute Situation -- adding that it wd be a mercy if she could be saved from Prostitution -- she has cloath 'd her , she maintains her -- she has already taught her to say her Prayers , & is not teaching her to read . as yet the Girl goes on vastly well & I sincerely hope Miſs Neville will be recorded by saving a Soul from death . she sends to me to Lecture her . the Girl already knows her Letters . so it is Aimiable to see with what patience & perseverance she gives her leſsons . Miſs Forest . Mr Crutchly Mr Metcalf have all left this place . since their departure , we have had Mr Tho 's Milles the Dean of Exeter s Son & Mr Rainsford -- they are also departed . & I am the only inmate . Mrs Jalabert charges me with her best Compliments to you -- she is very far from well & has occasion 'd me much uneasineſs , we Yesterday prevail 'd with her to take advice , I hear she is better this day . but complains of being Weak & low -- I have heard from dear Mrs Carter . & of her . she is in London . I wrote to her a very few days ago . she did not complain , so I hope she is quite well . in the last Sad News , we read that Col. Byng was killed he is Nephew to Miſs Forest , & no letter having been received from her since her departure we were afraid it is true . his Employment abroad did not require him to hazard his Life -- it was one of the Scandalous jots of this Ministry . Wyndham having married his Aunt -- so that Whilst we are starving the Publick Money is wasted . I do sincerely hope that little Margaret will as fully compensate your kindneſs to her . as I wish Philadelphia may that this of Miſs Neville s -- Margaret is very grateful for a very small favor & that is a good Sign -- tell yr dear daughter how much I love her -- & be aſsured how sincerely I wish her all a return of many happy years -- have you heard of or read the Modern Philosophers -- I was some Time before I could be persuaded to read this Novel , having been entirely sicken 'd into French principles but I think the Author has entered by ridicule to do some effectual Service tho the most serious divines has been able to Confeſs -- pray read it . There is infinite humour , & the moral is fine for it proves that however good the disposition -- without the foundation in religion it must fall to the Ground -- I find Lady H——n is not to be received at Court the Q : has positively refus 'd . she has excited some uneasineſs in Mrs Fitz & the Story goes that at Mrs Richard Walpole s she bawl 'd out is that old Woman Mrs Fitz . she calls her self 32 . I am sure she is a great deal more : the P : forc 'd Sir W . & Lady H——n to stay thro supper but whether Fitz terrified him or whether it was Caprice , he went away . & so did Mrs Fitz -- She was Mistreſs to C : —— G——lle -- I for one think this last News is good as any News can be , when so many human creatures see Sacrific 'd to Ambition , it certainly will oblige the Emperor to make Peace . & I trust we shall also be obliged to follow his example -- we have a great deal to give up & they have not any thing to return which I trust will enable us to make an Advantageous Peace -- how good you are about my letters . I did not expect much the one from my Aunt St Leger . but I have received one from her direction here poor Mama she is almost blind . who wd wish for old Eyes . I can not bring my self to wish that hers may see another Century . we have Prayers in this Chaple every morning -- I must tell you a trait of a boy of 12 years old . he went in Sunday morning to the poor man who is now dying -- & read him a Chapter in the New Testament -- you see how these Children are brought up -- I think I must have tired yr Eyes as well as tried yr Patience , I shall therefore bid you Adieu with my kind wish to you Mr D : & the dear Lsa . I remain most truly & Affecly yrs , DBloſset . Pray write to me . Lord B . goes away from the 14 th . to the 25 th . or 26 th . so do not inclose to him . I do not mind Postage -- indeed I do not -- pray write after seeing Harry Baily Walden Janry nine . 1801 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Griffin Braybrooke
