I have an engagement which is indispensable to my Rose trees and honeysuckles at Cowslip Green . I am going to spend a Week in Planting my little humble Garden , And as I do not trust any body else to plant so much as a Pink you can not imagine how busy I am , and how much this occupation interests and amuses me . Oh ! if You cou 'd one day see my little Cottage ! I have been cruelly disappointed ; it is not yet finished and I have never been able to sleep in it . I intend to go to Hampton the first Week in December , to stay there quietly with our friend , where we paſs the winter in a sober tete-a-tete , preparatory to the bustle and hurry of the Spring in London . I shall miſs You there sadly . but I will comf ort myself with thinking that You are well and happy , and that time and chance will re unite us . Pray say a great many kind and handsome things for me to Mr. D . of whom I never think but with pleasure . Adieu ! my dear friend ! I am with real affection Your faithful and obliged H More Bristol Octbr . 20 1785 Bristol October Twentieth 17 85 John Webb Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire Mrs. Dickenson by Chester
