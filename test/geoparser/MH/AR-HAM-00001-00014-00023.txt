You scarcely I imagine could hear in so short a time this Morg , of P William s going to Sea which he does within this fortnight , it was declared last Night & never was there so happy a being as he appeared to be , he goes with Admiral Digby , Princeſs Royal was really very much affected with it , the others not the least , we staid downstairs till ½ pt 10 . I do not think that you was in Spirits by the few lines you was so good as to write , which I am sorry for , Courage
