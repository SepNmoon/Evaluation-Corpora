Dear Sir On my return from the Opera late on Saturday night I found your very obliging letter which wou 'd otherwise have been answered by return of the Post . I am sorry my letter to Mrs. Dickenson shou 'd have convey 'd the idea , that by your continuing at Bath , the time you had fixed for so material an object as your health , I might be exposed to a disappointment in the busineſs of raising the money for my Son 's use , as I certainly imagined that if the Bond or Deed was executed at the time mention 'd for your return , it wou 'd come soon enough . In Scotland , money is to be had only at certain periods , for instance Lammas or the 1 st . of August is one of them , & if that paſses it can not be done till the next , which is Martinmaſs or the 1 st . November . It is uncertain when a vacancy may happen in the Regt . perhaps it may not , till it wou 'd be be perfectly convenient to me ; but as I am rather of a punctual disposition , I cou 'd wish to be prepared to receive the offer , which I am told is a very great favor . This being the case , I can with difficulty find words to express the sense of the obligation I feel myself under to you , for your generous confidence in me , in making me such an offer without the smallest parade ; the favor done me on your part , is most complete , and the remembrance of it on mine , will I trust be corresponding . I hope my Agent will be able to supply me , for your diverting such a Sum from the purpose you have allotted it for even a small period of time , might I am well aware , be attended with material inconvenience to you , and having found you so zealous in my interest , I can not be too scrupulous in my attention to yours . I must therefore with a thousand thanks to you , decline putting so heavy a tax upon your friendship . I every day expect my Son home ; & as you are so kind as to interest yourself in this matter , I shall not fail to acquaint you how it proceeds , for I shall be always happy in every opportunity of aſsuring you with how much truth I am Dear Sir Your faithful & obliged Humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton Oxford Str . 249 July 13 th . 1789 . P.S . Mr. Greville is going out of Town , having parted with his House , so that you will please not to send any more letters under cover to him . John Dickenson Esqr- N o . 18 . Queen Square Bath
