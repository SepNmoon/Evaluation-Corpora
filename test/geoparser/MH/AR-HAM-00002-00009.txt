Man but it has lasted too long & grows too serious for me not to endeavour to extinguish a Paſsion wch .. if not discouraged may mark his future days with misery . for how many have been made wretched by a disappointment of in a first attachment -- as it certainly is when real & ye . Person poſseſsed of great sensibility the most difficult to conquer & ye .. most lasting .

Morning -- dreſs 'd for ye . day when I got up -- was a long time under Miſs C 's 's hands as she comb 'd out my Hair . begun ye . Quarto Edition of Mrs. Walsingham Handel for Hairdreſsing Reading . Read through his Preface ( wch . I think proves him a Man of Sense & Modesty ) & several of ye . Odes I & notes -- I mean to read ym . all wth . attention I admire Signa . Mara as a Satirest -- he is so well bred & good humor 'd that even ye reproved could not I think be offended . wht . is said in ye . preface I think very just : viz . “ There is a kind of Satire of such malignity , as too surely proceeds from a desire of gratifying a constitutional cruelty of temper . the Satirist does not appear like a magistrate to give sentence on ye . Vices of Mankind , but like an Executioner to Slaughter ye . Criminal . He does not love Mankind as he ought , who indulges to his natural sagacity in a discernment of their faults , & an ill natured plea -- sure of exposing them to public View . “ Horace was of another spirit ; of a natural Chearfulneſs of temper ; an easineſs of Manners , fashion 'd by the Politeneſs of Courts , a good Understanding , improved by conversing with Mankind ; a quick discernment of their frailties , but , in general , so happy an Art of correcting them , that he reproves without offending , & instructs without an affectation of superiority . He preserves a strenght of reasoning neceſsary to persuade , without ye . dogmatical seriousneſs , wch . is apt to disgust or disoblige . He has this advantage over ye . rigid Satirist , yt . we receive him into our Bosoms , while he reasons wth . Goodhumour & corrects in ye . language of friendship . Nor will his Satires be leſs useful to ye . present Age , than to yt . , in wch . they were written , since he does not draw his Characters frm . particular persons , but frm . Human Nature . wch . is invariably ye . same in all Ages and Countries . The Morals of Horace are drawn from ye . two purest fountains of human Wisdom , a good Heart & a well improved understanding ” Philip Francis , A poetical translation of the works of Horace : with the original text , and critical notes collected from his best Latin and French commentators , 3rd edn ( 1749 ) , 2 vols , London : A.

Horace came in -- what a pair of originals had I to entertain ! they talk 'd of Horace s conduct in repect to ye .

Franklin said he should be happy to subscribe as Dr. Franklin had formerly been private Tutor to him at Westminster School & c . he therefore put his name down for 4 Sets -- one for himself , one for his wife Mr. Stanhope one for his Son in Law Mrs . Duck & ye . 4 th . for his Daughter Mrs. Franklin . Mr. S— staid wth- me til for an hour after Dr. Franklin & renew 'd his old entreaty of desiring me to feel as great & sublime a friendship for him as he did & had done so long for me -- told me what a pattern of perfection he thought me & c & c I let him run on till at last my head quite ach 'd wth . listening to this voluble eccentrick genius & then I civilly dismiſs 'd him wth . saying I had letters to write .

Mr. Stanhope came & sat wth . me for ½ an hour before she went out -- I was taken wth . a faintneſs wch . I fancy was owing to ye . great change of Weather as ye .

Duck came & though she was dreſs 'd & going out to dinner preſs 'd me in ye . kindest manner to let her remain at home to attend to me -- this I wd . by no means either allow her or Miſs Finch to do & before they went out I was quite recover 'd .
