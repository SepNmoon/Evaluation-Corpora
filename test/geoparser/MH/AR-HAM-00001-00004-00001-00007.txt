Dear Miſs Hamilton Your very obliging letter of the 19 th . of this Inst . is now before me and as you have desired my opinion upon a step that you think advisable to take with regard to drawing Two Hundred Pounds from the 3 pr.Ct . stock for the uses you mention , I take this first opportunity of aſsuring you that I perfectly agree with you upon the propriety of it , and moreover think that this diminution of your little capital will be of no consequence , & tho ' Mrs. Hamilton requires no further proofs of your tenderdeſs & affection for her yet you will undoubtedly feel a secret satisfaction in the reflection of having doubled your attentions at this critical time . I have no opinion of German Doctors , their prescriptions are commonly too rough . I have often heard of Dr. Burton and think you can not consult a better Person . Mr. Fetherston call 'd here a few days ago & seem 'd much pleased that he had been able to remit the remainder of Mrs Hamilton 's half years Rent , which I hope will be come to hand before the receipt of this . The distreſses of this Country are so uncommonly great , that I really know not what we are to expect , it is impossible that Rents shou 'd be paid as formerly , there being little money left in the Country & no trade to bring a return of it . I can not say that I am much flatter 'd by his M——y 's recollection of me attended with trivial enquiries , having receiv 'd receiv 'd repeated promises of a more substantial remembrance , which has been deferr 'd so long that it wou 'd be foll e y to ground any hopes upon it . When arrived to the age of fifty , it is time to be discouraged from the pursuit of favors that I had good reason to expect for these twenty years past . It is matter of real consolation to me to be able to aſsert with confidence that tho ' I have fail 'd in my expectations of royal favor so often promised , my conduct has ever been such as wou 'd not discredit a man of honor . From the number of low & mean Persons in general that fill the bench of Bishops in this Country it wou 'd seem that our Governors thought the interests of Religion safer in the hands of Schoolmasters and Tutors than in those men of birth & property , but I am sensible this is a digreſsion I shou 'd have avoided , however it shall introduce a piece of advice to you , that you shou 'd remain with a firm & constant persuasion that r——l favor is hardly earned , and too frequently blown away by the slightest blast . I beg you will accept of our best wishes & remember us affectionately to Mrs. Hamilton of whom we hope soon to receive better accounts , I am Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton December 1 st 1778 Latour , Clontarf near Dublin
