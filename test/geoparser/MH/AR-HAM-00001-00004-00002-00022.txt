My dear Sir No words can expreſs my gratitude to you & Mrs. Dickenson for your unwearied attention to my dearest daughter ; on a former occasion when she was visited with a similar affliction in Bath , her perilous state appeared to me so very evident that I lost all command over my grief , but alas ! her present case is still much more desperate not having at this moment a ray of hope . Nothing but the dread of meeting her cruel husband prevents my setting out immediately for London but if the unfortunate sufferer shoud even be alive at my arrival , I coud not answer it to myself to disturb her last moments . shoud she be capable of receiving comfort from her Father s bleſsing when you see her after having received this letter , convey it I beseech you in the most impreſsive terms You poſeſs your self a most excellent daughter & thereforefore you can duely estimate my feelings at this perilous crisis . My head is too confused to dwell longer upon this painful subject . At a further period I hope I shall not be wanting in every possible demonstration of my affection . With my kindest remembrance to Mrs . & Miſs Dickenson I remain Dear Sir Your faithful & much obliged humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Bath May 23 d . 1810 . John Dickenson Esqr . N o 49 . Welbeck Street London
