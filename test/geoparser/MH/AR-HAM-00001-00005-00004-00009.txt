Dear Lady Warwick , My Sister & I are much obliged to you for your kind remembrance of us in sending us the pattern of your gown , & for having been so good as to take the trouble of doing so large a peice which was quite beyond our expectations . I had intended thanking you in person this morning but from various mistakes have been prevented from getting out , shall hope for another opportunity -- I am Dear Mrs. Dickenson your obedt Servant Mrs Dickenson Albemarle St . Monday . H. Warwick 1795
