Edinr- 1 st . Novr- 1779 I have this moment received your Epistle , & being in the most intolerable bad humour , owing to a Sore throat & pain in my Breast , I can not resist a secret impulse I feel , to tell you , that I imputed your Silence to none of the three Reasons you are pleased to mention , & I can aſsure you that your Vanity has every reason to be mortified -- Distreſses have been multiplied upon me , even to the length of not making me feel them -- An Uncle , a young man I doated upon Dead ; disappointed in a Company I had agreed for -- Lady Northk- so dreadfully burnt ( by her head dreſs taking fire ) that she has been confined to her Bed these three Weeks & unable to see any body -- Lady Hopetoun ( my Other Counsellor ) is likewise ill , & invisible . If I contrive to visit the South this Winter , I am determined to finish the matter one Way or other , by applying personally to Ms- L . . She is of such a temper , that should I make proposals & not be accepted of , her mauvaise honte is so great , that she would not be able to be in Company with me ; this besides a thousand other Substantial reasons , not proper to be trusted upon paper , determines me to postpone all further proceedings , 'till I am more certain of my own Motions . If you will be giddy & sprain your hands , all I can say is , They are your own , & you may treat them accordingly . I am not perfectly certain whether I am obliged to your can give you credit , for your introduction to character of His H. R . I agree with you as to being born a Prince That exceſs of diſsimulation with which they are surrounded , & that Kingcraft neceſsary for them to know & to make use of , must des troy the seeds of many Virtues & amiable qualities which I dare say many of them , are born with -- I should make a bad Courtier , being unable to flatter the actions of a Prince , when incompatible with the Virtues of a Man . I hope the young Man you speak of , will be surrounded with honest people ; the chance is wonderfully against him . Tho ' a good deal of an Anti-Courtier , I aſsure you I am a very loyal Subject , & would with pleasure furnish the last shilling of my fortune & last drop of my blood to promote the welfare of the most gracious Prince that ever poſseſsed the throne of this or any other Kingdom . The P——t of Ireland are ungenerous , not to say unjust . Their demand of a free trade , at a time when We dare not irritate them & when they know that to be the case , puts me out of all patience . God grant more fortunate times , for I 'm sure we never had more need of them -- I am pleased with Ld- Stormont s promotion . He is a Man of busineſs & I really beleive capable of filling the office with Credit & Reputation , Your intelligence about Mrs- Graham I suspect to be premature , as her departure is quite unknown to me . I find you still have compaſsion for poor J. H . his name has not been mentioned in my hearing since I came down . Adieu . Your Affectionate Brother N—— P.S . Whether you are at Windsor or Kew , you have not thought proper to communicate
