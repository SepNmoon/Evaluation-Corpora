St James 's Sepr . 4 th -- As I am sure you will be satisfied with a few lines my dear dear Friend I can not find in my heart to refuse you that pleasure tho ' my head is quite distracted -- I shall direct this to Eſsex -- so that having written yesterday into Northamtonshire you will not wait long for the information you wish about me wherever you may be -- there I am -- I left my kind Friend Mrs Vesey after Dinner and since I arrived have been increasing my headache and flushing by writing a long letter to my Father who is at present in Lincolnshire -- Be quite easy on the score of my Health my dearest Friend , I am as well as ever -- for my infirmities & habitual complaint will I fear never leave me -- on Saturday I return to the Bark . Since I arrived I have heard that the Lord Mayer does not make his appearance tomorrow -- this is a great relief to me -- for I should have made a point of waiting and the transition from a Domestick to a dreſsed Cap would have been at least disagreeable -- I was out as usual in the Phaeton this morning , we went to Hamton to see Mrs Stuart & c -- but did not find them at home -- I propose returning to breathe the restoring & wholesome air of the Park on Saturday or Sunday but I am not sorry to be at home for a Day or two , in my own quiet comfortable habitation -- to refresh & recuellir myself , after so long an absence -- I have a thousand things to arrange -- and millions of letters to write , and a journal of three weeks to fill up -- I was interrupted in this place by a speech of Lady Carlow s which has given rise to a conversation that has lasted some time -- it has not left me happier than I was before -- but it has so discomposed & overturned broke the chain of my ideas that it is impoſsible for me to continue my letter with any appearance of consistency or common sense I conclude -- you know that I am well , be aſsured that I love you -- let this suffice -- adieu dear Friend -- I need not add that I am tenderly yours -- I will write on Monday wherever I am -- adieu again -- remember me kindly To Bell
