Canterbury March 7 th - 1773 I have attempted above twenty times My dearest Mary writing you but might as well have just tryed to have jumped to Northampton as to write nor do I know whither I 'll be able to make out this ſide as I am interrupted every moment , this is my buſy time nor have I time almost to sit down from seven in the morning to bed time , what with field days , drills on Horse back & Foot , parades , & other neceſsary business 's my time is so taken up that my friends must take the word for the deed till after the King s review , & except to Mrs Napier & yourself I am resolved not to write a single line and you both must be content with a few lines your selves , this My dearest Girl I tell you that you may not expect long ones from me till after I see you which I hope will be in the middle of May in my way northwards . You give me your opinion of Colonel Bland which I make no doubt is ju st tho I am little acquaint with him but as a Soldier never having ſeen him much but in Camp , as to common place Compliments to the Lady 's thats a fault most Men get when young and often continues with them after years grows upon them , you My dear Mary have been bred up very differently from the generality of your Sex otherwise you would not have been either surprised or shocked at hearing these Compliment s made use off to young Ladys indiscriminally , as they have no meaning they becom e words of course & go into one ear & out of t'other , & a little more uſuage in the World will shew you its the only conversation carried on between the young people of either Sex in this age , so no wonder if some of it remains with both after they come to more years . It gives me great concern to hear o f Mr Hope 's misfortune tho its been a wonder to his friends it has not happened long ago I shall be extremely glad if it brings his affairs to a happy Criſses tho I am apprehendſive that those relations he has that are able to extricate him out of his dificulty 's are so angry with him that they will do little or nothing for him I shall be happy if I am mistaken but own I dread the worst . Take care My dearest Ward , pity is a virtue but carried too far may become a vice , pity from a Young Lady with such a Mind as yours , may lead to a very disagreeable point and may make you paſs many many unhappy hours , days & even years , you will I am ſure excuse me in writing so freely but the Warm th you expreſs about Mr Hope & his affairs makes made me really afraid that Your sensibility ( which is extremely strong ) may without your knowledge produce another paſsion which I most sincerely wish not to see in you , but towards a proper object , which considering his Children & many other good reasons he can not be , Happy should I be to see My dear Ward properly settled for Life but th e n it must be with one who is not only capable but willing to make her happineſs the study of his Life such a Man & no other deſerves My Mary & while I have any thing to say with her none but such a Man ever shall call her his . write My dear girl soon , examine your own heart ( & keep nothing from your most sincere Friend ) & if you find the least Symtom of the tender kind get the better of it as ſoon as poſsible , your own good ſense I know will ſoon convince you & those things are eaſily got the better off at first Adieu My dearest Mary write soon as I really am extremely uneaſy & till you aſsure me otherwise must continue so , but as I have all the reason in the World to believe you 'll be sincere with me I hope in a few days to be put out of my pain My best respects to Mrs Hamilton & believe me My dearest Mary most ſincerely & most Affctly Yours & c
