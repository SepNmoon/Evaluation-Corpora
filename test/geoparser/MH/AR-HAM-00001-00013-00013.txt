Dearest R Glover Esq . . Miranda & myſelf have nothing to relieve our conſtant regret at your continued abſence , which we know to be unavoidable , but by making your perfections a frequent subject of diſcourſe . In the humour I now am , I will applaud my poor dove for nothing , but her art ; of which take the preſent inſtance . She , conſcious , that I am full of juſt rage againſt her , hath moſt cunningly found the only means of compoſing it by putting her pen into my hand for the pleaſing purpoſe of writing to you . This being done , my rage returns . In ſhort this morning she hath broke my heart , the heart ( cruel puſs ) she had so great a share in . Adieu , Sweet Mrs Glover . Yours & ca & ca & ca . & ca . Miranda
