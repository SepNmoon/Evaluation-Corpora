Boston Octr : 19 th 1768 Nothing but want of ability to write should so long have prevented my thanking my Dear Mrs- Napier for her obligeing Letter -- I 'm happy with the good Accounts you give Us of yr Pappa & Mamma 's Health & Congratulate them upon haveing conquer 'd their Gout & Rhumatism -- as for Colds I dont fear much from them & hope both Miſs Hamilton & You have lost the remembrance of haveing had them beffore You can Receive this . We are very Sorry the Venison never came to hand ; proveably the Keeper had heard the Regt : had left Northampton -- & so did not Kill the Buck : but we have heard no more about it Ourselves . I 'm glad Mrs Hamilton is so very Indifferent about our Return as it wont give him Uneasineſs to know that the Troops are order 'd to remain in Lincolnshire all Winter & that the Horses are brought from Graſs to the different Quarters here -- I must therefore beg either yr Pappa or Mamma to acquaint Mr Samuel that we return no more to Northampton -- Mr Samuell would have wrote so to him -- but I write this from his bed Side to which he is confined by a feverish Indisposition -- so beg they 'll give him this Information -- he sayd at parting he 'd paint the Parlour for his own Conveniency whether we came back or not & did not mean going back to the House till the end of this Month whether we came or Not so he is still in time to do it sooner than we could have been there had the Regt . return 'd . Asure yourselves we regreate much being so far remov 'd from you -- & shall ever retain the most Gratefull Sense of yr Polite & friendly attention to Us while with You -- of this fact asure yr Pappa & Mamma as well as yourself -- as to any thing else I had no partiality for Northampton nor do I Sigh after Babylonish Acquaintance -- Intimacy I never should have formed there but with Yourselves : much do I wish we had been near each other Selfish enough you 'll Say when I tell you I shall want the comfort of Agreeable friends to Nurse me when confined & to keep up my Spiritts till that time -- as I lie in ; in febry or March -- I 'm now out of all Danger from my dangerous fall , but Suffer greatly both from Situation & Uneasineſs of Mind -- Mr Napier & Harriot are both confined to their room mostly to bed by the fever & Ague Mary has had a touch of it but we hope she 'll get it off easily -- we hope Mainie 's wont last either I 've heard twice from Ruſsia where our friends were Well & much pleas 'd with their Situation & Reception -- Mr Napier seems in high Spiritts asure yr Pappa wt ever be c ame of the Letter I know my Br wrote one to him beffore he left London because he wrote to me he had done so , to bid him Adieu & to thank him & all of you for yr goodneſs to Us wch we had mention 'd to him in the terms we thought it deservd Pray is Lady Cathcart brought to bed yet & wt has she got ? its yet uncertain whether Head Quarters may not be fixt at Lincoln for the Winter -- if so we go there -- if not we continue where we are -- Boston affords all proper Aſsistance for my Situation -- I hope soon to hear good Acts from you wt a History of all Memorable transactions amongst You ; all our best respects attend Mrs Frederick Hamilton & Mr & Yourself yr Cousins as well as we are Heartily sorry its like to be so long beffore we Meet : however we hope to have that pleasure often in some other part of the World wherever we are our best Wishes are Yours Adieu my Dear Madam -- bellieve me Ever Your Sincearly Affectionate & c & c Mrs Hamilton
