Thursday 26 th - August 1779 ½ past 9 oclock My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , I hope you did not suspect me of me being disingenuous in my accounts or rather in my confeſsions concerning ye conversation that paſsed between W—— R—— and myself about yrself . I give you my honor in ye . most sacred manner that I do not recollect a single Syllable more paſsing between him me , so far from ever attempting to trust myself to him I never had any such idea , & I hope that some time or other I shall be able to make him sensible of his fault , and then punish him in a manner proper to shew him that I will never pardon ingratitude for I look upon it almost as ye . worst of Vices , I do not so much wonder at his conduct for you must remember my old favorite reflection , “ that impudence and deceit always go together ” Believe me my swe etest Friend I have always found it so , as well in people of higher rank sphere in life as in those of a lower rank . However you will say think at least if you do not say it , ( but you scarce ever will conceal from a friend those thoughts which you can communicate to them in so delicate a manner as you generally do ) que c'est tout a fait hors de charactere pour for a young man like me thus to moralize , and in a manner to teach his own master . I hope you will find a me a pretty apt Scholar , and that I ſhall imbibe with ye . greatest avidity the excellent præcepts you are so good as to give me , & that I shall religiously follow them , practice them & abide by them through ye . rest of my life . We are now separated from each other . I wish to see you , & wish to set with you & to converse with you freely upon many Topics , but I my utmost wish is , never to be separate from you , to be live constantly with you , & to paſs our time partly in friendly conversation and partly in love , and in ye . Joys of Matrimony . I often when I am in a pensive mode , set & brood over my favorite object , & build what are vulgarly called Castles in ye air , I think I see yrself & me happy in our union , & enjoying ye utmost felicity that can be , & thinking , but then all of a sudden those thoughts vanish , and I am as it were left in a maze , and know not which way to follow in order to fix my wandring ideas . Pray my sweetest Friend continue yr . kind admonitions to me , and continue to treat me with that freedom which you have hitherto done . May you enjoy all manner of prosperity in this world and may we hereafter meet never again to separate in ye next , this is ye constant Prayer of Yr . Palemon . turn P.S . Excuse ye . shortneſs of this Letter , excuse ye . badneſs of its style , & the little there is in it for ye . length of it , but it was wrote in a hurry , for I was afraid of being interrupted . Pray inform me as soon as you hear any thing concerning W—— sooner if you shld .. chance to hear any thing sooner than me , you shall inform me , if I hear any thing sooner than you , I will inform you . I suppose you have heard of A——d 's being made C——n of W——r , vous voyez qu'on ne prend rien a la Cour en étant flatteur , en se rendant le Bouffon de la Cour , et en jouant un Role digne d'un homme indigne du Charactère d'un homme , indigne de la nature de l'homme . I beg you will also inform me if you hear any thing more of W. R 's nonsense . Expliquez moi ma chère pourquoi vous ne vous promenez jamais , et pourquoi vous n'étiez pas de la Promenade hier au soir . j'ai mille choses a vous dire au sujet de cette promenade . Encore Adieu , Adieu , Adieu tout ce qui m'est cher au monde Vôtre Palemon toujours de même
