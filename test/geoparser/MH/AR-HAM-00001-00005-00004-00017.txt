December 27 th . My Dear Dickenson I do aſsure you a common pain in my face should not have prevented me from having called on you or receiving you & Gl . Anson when you were so obliging as to call on me But I have a very severe Cold in all its forms & it has not deigned to retire back in dignified leisure . however my light Spirits annoy his rear & I think no vestige of the Enemy will long remain -- As to dining I have not done it for some days & if I do not relapse wch I do not apprehend I shall dine Saturday with my Family near Southn . I have not yet seen my Sister so you may suppose I have not only thought myself ill. -- I need not say that otherwise I should most gladly have accepted your Invitation for it will be a great Satisfaction to me to congratulate you Mrs. Dickenson & my Cousin on the happy & I hope speedy prospect of seeing her united to a person in all respects such as a wise as well as indulgent Parent would desire as a Son in Law Pray aſsure Gl . Anson that I regret very much that I have been so unfortunate as to miſs the Opportunity of making his Acquaintance which I shall not when I can fail to do -- The American news was indeed most unexpected to me if I ever gave the despicable nation any Credit their unworthy vain boasting ( knowing what they must have known ) would have anihilated it fully . I hope we shall not let them too much liberty to plague us again . With best Afft . Compts . to Mrs Dickenson & your Daughter I am Always yours Warwick J. Dickenson Esqr
