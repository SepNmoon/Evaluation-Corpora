I hope you will not be offended dearest dearest dearest Sister , Friend at my presuming to tell you as in yr . own language you offended my pride & honor in the last Note you writ me . However I will not enter upon any thing before you have promised me to calm yr . Spirits . Keep this Letter till you find yourself composed , and in a fit disposition to reason , & let not yr . Spirits be so much flurried . You tell me I have acted ungenerously in relieving you from yr . promeſs , by putting you under such a restraint , you also say you wish that I may learn to reason more justly , I will explain my motives to you for so doing , as I once promised to you when I freely gave you my friendship , not to have a secret of my Soul concealed from a friend I love so tenderly . Were you now to go or indeed at any time till I am at liberty , tho ' you were to make ever so good an excuse such as yr . health , or ill treatment , the World & indeed all ye Domesticks of this family , wld .. endeavour to find out some secret reason for yr . departure , they wld .. const ruct the innocent visits of my Messenger , as well as ye—— little attentions I have shewn you , neither which have struck them yet , nor wld .. they strike them now nor at any time unleſs you was to think of going into some private reasons , & they wld .. then think they had found out a cause for yr . departure which I do not think of a nature fit to be mentioned of to a person who has yr such disinterested , honorable , & virtuous notions as my dearest friend has . Pardon me I conjure you , if I ſhall make use of any improper terms expreſsions , or if I should speak too warmly , upon this subject , when you consider it as ye subject dearest dearest , dearest Sister , ye subject of all others in which I look upon myself as most interested do pardon me . Were you then to go some time hence ye . same cause wld .. be attributed to it , I could not , could not , could not bear to hear ye . smallest imputation cast upon ye . spotleſs Character of my angelick friend , you are purer & whiter than Snow itself . I do not mention what my situation wld .. be at our separation , that I have already told you in one of my former Letters , if my interest is as dear to you , as you tell me it is , so much so , that you tell me say , you wld .. sacrifice almost every thing to it , even my friendſhip , ( Oh my God that you ever could have said this ) you will not go till I am at liberty , it can not now be long before I am so , whereas if you was to go soon you would not only ruin me in ye opinion of ye World , but in what is much more dear to me in ye eyes of my Parents , for I could not conceal ye agonies I should feel . If you found yourself slighted or ill treated I would then have you go , only inform me of it before you take any ſteps towards it , then do not consider what my unfortunate situation wld .. be , wretched as I then should be , I would willingly sacrifice ye woes I could not hide , to yr . tranquillity , peace , or quiet . I conjure you by all that 's sacred and dear to you do not quit us . You alarm me exceedingly when you desire me not to ask any more questions at present , & that you will soon clear up and explain every thing to you me , I will not then , O how readily do we obey when you we really love ! I can not however help being very impatient to know what they are . Let me therefore entreat you once more that you will not go , except for ye reason I have mentioned , I pray unto God constantly to dispose yr . mind to grant this request to me , and to prevent yr . Spirits from being so much lowered , & once more to restore you that look of natural chearfulneſs which became you so much . My spirits are also very much sunk , and chearfulneſs will no more revisit my brow , until I hear that you have shaken off that gloom of Melancholy , which has too long hung upon you to a certain degree , I am grown emaciated my appetite is gone , & forced to appear gay , & chearful in company , I feel ye . more when I retire into my own private room be it only for a single moment . My Gentlemen attribute it to some little Cold I have caught from ye . change of ye Weather But Alas ! the cause has taken too deep root soon to vanish . Wherefore let me beseech you , if it be only , from yr . tenderneſs friendship or affection to me , you would calm yr . soul a little , & look not into futurity , and perceive things in so black a light . My dearest Father not long ago told me he had been reading a Book in which there was a paſsage which struck him very much , “ It is wrong to suppose we are always to be happy in this World , but it is impious to ye . Deity , to suppose we are always to be unhappy . ” Precise quotation not traced . Wherefore let me entreat of you dearest dearest dearest Sister , friend , Angel , compose yrself . and see things in a better prospect . I will consent not to mention ye . subject of Love to you again , as it can not be but painful to us both , let it however unite us in ye . bonds of ye holiest , firmest , & most innocent friendship which nothing but death shall annihilate . I kiſsed with enthusiastick fondneſs ( 't is yr . own expreſsion ) every mark where ye Paper was blurred with yr tears , O Heaven was I ye . cause of their flowing gracious God forbid , you say you wished you never had seen , is it because you hate me , no that can not be , for yr . generous mind is not capable of calling that man its friend , whom it hates , or is it because you look upon me as ye . cause & origin of all yr . misfortunes , if I thought you did you should see my face no more ; I can see therefore but one reason & that proceeds from yr . tenderneſs for me , that is that you are afraid that I shall fall & sink under some dreadful misfortune , from ye . impetuosity , violence , & nobleneſs of my attachment . I own my sweetest friend , you to a degree hurt my honor ( another expreſsion of yr . own ) in recommending to me to destroy , yr . last Letter as well as every other you had written to me , I own I thought you had confidence in me as to suppose I would execute every promise I made to you most especially , however I attribute it mostly to ye general flutter yr . spirits were in . I also heard of yr . generosity it is of a piece with the rest of yr . great , noble and exalted sentiments , however I can not help confeſsing it hurt my pride a little . The impending danger also of my dear Brother W : for I understand ye two fleets are now in sight of each other greatly distreſses me . Were I ever to lose my two dearest Parents , or my two dearest Brothers F . & W . nothing in ye could attach me to this World but yrself in whom my whole happineſs cont ent s , and were I to be separated from you , or to lose you , nothing should keep me in it by —— I will not make an impious Oath . I have now nothing more to add , but to conjure you by our Almighty & ever merciful Father , to grant this request to me concerning yr . departure , and to compose yr . spirits , and to aſsume an air of chearfulneſs , bear up against ye gloom that oppreſses you consider that you owe to yr . maker as a Christian , till then ye . bosom of yr . truly affectionate friend will be a ſtranger to happineſs . Adieu if you any ever had any affection for me you will grant me my request , I am & ever shall be , sweetest , dearest , loveliest Sister , Yr . sincerely attached Friend & Brother . P.S . I shall send my Meſsenger to town about some busineſs of his own ye day after tomorrow , I shall make him leave a Note at G——y 's which shall contain ye . orders how ye b—— shall be made , wherefore I beg of you send me a Motto in yr . next tomorrow , when he carries you ye . N—— . If you have any Meſsages , Letter or Notes to leave any where , or any busineſs to do which he can , he shall do it , composez vous je vous en supplie jusqu ' à ce que nous nous rencontrons ce qui sera a cette heur de bien totale -- j'attends mon Ami Salgas dans moins d'une Semaine . Faite moi savoir je vous en supplie auſsitôt que vous savez quelque chose de W—— . I send you with this , Letters which no body has seen but L. C. F . and myself , I mean that of my Mother , but that of my Father more have seen , to shew to you , how far their affection extends to all their Children -- Adieu Adieu Adieu ,
