You who enjoy rural felicity I hope in Derbyshire , do you now and then think of a certain old blade who vegetates at Bermuda 3000 miles distant from fashion , amusement rational conversation and the well known faces of well known friends -- you do , I promise myself and am flatterd in the hope -- my gratitude is not yet out at elbows for the kind provocation you gave me my dear boy to a correspondence , I did with pleasure accept the challenge and am demonstrating to you that I thought myself honored by it -- you are rich in information , anecdote , private and public , even your fireside furnishes intelligence of an interesting kind to one who is of the old fashioned breed , and thinks meanly of the fopperies and follies on which the Women of the Age doat and the men follow them -- I aſsert that Women are the leaders of paſsions and pursuits as well as fashions , I need not to go to History for proofs I feel it , and I wish I had better pretensions on which to ground my Assertions -- but let me not repine at my being single or antient , perhaps my female directreſs would not have chosen a silken thing for my tether , but as Jerry says might have hectord & domineerd like the Devil -- no intermediate condition for I should either have buckled unconditionally and worn my badges of submiſsion gilt or plain without a murmur or have whistled off Madam to graze where she might find her pasture most suited to her taste -- digreſsions and parentheses make the body of my letters in general , and I sometimes allow myself to go down hill as chance directs and scarce know how to recover my former ground -- You have been uncommonly amused no doubt with the extravaganzas of the Neapolitan Knight , pray tell me . I recollect a very virtuous little fellow of C . College Oxford whose wig was the most orthodoxically buckled , & his shoes rivaling the best Japanned tea=tray , called me to account for ridiculing some of my Aunts , profeſsed old routers , who paſsed by far the greatest part of their lives with cards in their hands . his reproof was couched in terms very well chosen and claſsically correct , but I could not help laughing at his solemnity , for in my idea our relations are the fairest of all game , and it is from the consideration of being parties , that we endeavor to conceal their foibles or palliate them since we make no scruple of running down our fellow Christians if they be removed from us a certain canonical distance -- If Mother Church was to go into the reverends idea we should have a table of censure scandal and ridicule beginning “ A man may not laugh at his Grandmother ” continued down to “ his Wife 's Sister 's daughter ” -- now that would to me be a very great confinement who have such a number of relations at most of whom I have been laughing all my life . I know full well I have payd my share of the reckoning and from the very egg was inured to scoffings gibes mimickry and sarcasm till I was “ No Minister so sore ” Alexander Pope , The First Satire of the Second Epistle of Horace Imitated ( 1733 ) , l.76 . I recoverd however and learned to act first on the defensive till years fortifying these pleasant propensities I became sufficiently offensive -- If by chance you should become a little wearisome in your retreat perhaps Bath may be your resource , There is a band of & of course a set of good folk who in the Indian phrase will be well pleased to brighten the chain of friendship , I could like well to be of the party and to exhibit myself in a better light than when I was last there , I was a little devoured with sulk gloom low pulse and other quiddities which disqualifyed me for the society of my good friends who were at hearts ease and tickled with a feather -- the uncommon vivacity & novelty of Character of Lydia White wer e by far the most antiphlegmatic lozenges that Bath afforded , I hated myself all the time I was there , I am now on better terms with myself , tho still a little queerish sometimes -- With all this crookedneſs of disposition I am no mysogyne , no , I am quite an advocate for Gay 's principle , “ if the heart of a man & ca ” John Gay , The Beggar 's Opera III.iii . but then she must be such a one as you would like for a companion . how many do I know ! but then they are the properties of others , all bespoke , no not all , but then they are hanging on boughs out of reach . In sober sadneſs I must content myself with being vieux garçon , sith 'twill no better be The Ballad of Chevy Chase -- All this time I have not said of a Word of what paſſes in this little World of Rocks and Shoals , and I have so good reason for my silence that I shall leave things as they are . one day is so like another ( except when a Veſsel brings letters ) that I may say night and day , clouds or sunshine constitute the principal varieties if to this are added the viciſsitudes of roast and boiled , you may form a tolerable estimate of my pastimes and resources -- If I should proceed to another sheet , perhaps I may give a better account of myself for to confeſs a truth this is one of my un days -- on the 30 th I must recollect how old I am perhaps the approach affects my Spirits as one of Congreve 's characters says upon the appearance of his Wife , he felt a friſson God help him -- You will tell me about home . Mrs : D . Louisa and whatever is nearest your heart A Vessel offers for Dominica -- Adieu . Nov- : 25 th . 1791 .
