London ye 20 th . Septr . 1776 . Dear Miranda . The inexpreſsible entertainment , I have receiv 'd from your letters , which have been regularly read to me sometimes by Catherina sometimes by Anna Maria , ought to have raiſ 'd in me some emulation , nay an immediate deſire to succeed in the epiſtolary channel of converſing with a diſtant friend ; but I still feel , that my unjuſtifiable diſlike of writing letters will never be eraſ 'd : how comes it then , that I now take up my pen , without its uſual reluctance , and conceive in its preſent employment a moſt senſible pleaſure ? This , Miranda , becauſe I am writing to you -- either from gratitude for the pleaſure , you have given me , or that you in your frequent commerce with Romiſh temples and convents have learn 'd the art of working miracles : it is certainly the latter ; for you , sweet saint , surpaſs them all , and I am a living inſtance of your power . Laſt night in the presence of your good mother and the Miſs Clarkes , after the peruſal of your laſt letters , Mrs. Glover with an air of sovereignty aſk 'd me , if I would not write to Miranda ; I meekly replied , that I had much rather go to Spaa , and make my excuſes : but what with a series of reflection , while awake , and of dreams , while aſleep , I roſe in the morning , poſseſs 'd with something so like inspiration , that after a short pauſe of wonder at my sudden change , I seiſ 'd my pen with tranſport , & instantly diſcover 'd , that the firſt words dear Miranda , contain 'd a spel not to be weaken 'd by diſtance , or time , nor to be reſiſted by any habitual antipathy to a mode of authorſhip , whoſe excellence is render 'd so demonſtrable in her . I proceed to inform you , that every one of the society is well , sharing in your preſent felicity , and improving with every new diſcovery by the dove sent out from our own ark . Your tour in itſelf is moſt agreeable ; but how much more so to your senſibility under such a guidance & protection . I shall forever worſhip Lord & Lady Dartrey for their parental care of you , and tender attention to your mother . Reſpecting him , you have long been appriſ 'd of my sentiments ; they are founded on perſonal knowledge : of her Ladyſhip I can only say , that I found her amiable at sight ; but through you I quickly learn 'd to believe , that her merit is equal to his : this , I fancy , will content her . Pray kiſs her hands in my behalf ; you may kiſs him , where you pleaſe : whatever of this kind you beſtow on him , you may place to my account ; and I promiſe to repay you with intereſt upon intereſt . You will probably expect from me some news from America . I really have none to send , but will refer you to Mr. Ellis at Spaa , who is a conſummate doctor on that subject . I hope , you have made acquaintance with him . He is not horridly conceited , nor sly , but senſible , very senſible . He is no French petit maitre , nor Engliſh macaroni , but that ſtrange sort of being , who writes knowledge , honour & probity with a great fortune . Pray accoſt him with my moſt reſpectful compliments ; and then , if he ever thought , that I was harſh in my examination of him at the bar of the commons , he will gratefully admit , that I make him a profuſe attonement . With a thouſand thanks for your accurate and satiſfactory anſwer to my queſtion in Flemiſh huſbandry . I remain with unalterable truth Dear Miranda . Your Moſt Faithful & devoted Servt R Glover . Mrs. Glover with her compliments lets you know , that every day will exceed the length of a week , till you return . Esqr . The author of Leonidas Hosiers Ghost & c .
