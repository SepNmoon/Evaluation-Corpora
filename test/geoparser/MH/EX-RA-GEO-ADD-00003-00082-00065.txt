21 st . Novbr . 1779 Sunday Morng . 10 o'Clock In answer to Night : You can not imagine , my ever dearest Miranda what this last Letter of yrs . has cost me , chear up yr . spirits and give us not so bad an omen you know how violent my paſsions are , were I to conceive yt . yr . apprehensions had ye . least grounds , I know not to what lengths my dispair & grief , wld .. carry me But we must resign every thing to Providence , yr . friendship , love , & affection my ever dearest Sister , are ye . utmost object of my life , Oh wld . to Heaven ye . Almighty had placed me in such a situation as to have called my Miranda , Mine I then shd .. have looked upon myſelf as ye . happiest Being in ye . whole Creation , however it does not become us to murmur at ye . decrees of our All merciful , all wise , allmighty Parent , we must submit with resignation to ym . & make ye . best & chearfullest use of yt . line of life , in wh .. it has pleased him to place us . Come my Miranda chear up yr . spirits , & dry up yr . precious tears , we have I trust in God many long , long Years yet to live , & our friendſhip , if my Prayers are heard will be as unalterable fore ver as ye . perpetual decrees of Fate . I own I am vexed we did not meet to night I had formed many delicious , delectable diletante charming , delightful ideas of our meeting this Afternoon . & of our Could we have managed to have slipped out into another Room I shd .. have taken my leave only for a time , of my dearest Friend in a manner wh .. I think wld .. have drawn if not a tear , at leaſt a ſigh from her tender heart . Yr . bosom my Miranda is not formed for ye . vulgar coarse feelings of ye . World in general , it is too delicately , if I may so framed , too susceptible if poſsible of refined & deliate feelings . It is impoſsible for me to expreſs my attachment to you , it is something more than human , to call it love , friendship , affection , is undervaluing it , it is as it were all those paſsions refined into one , ( you will perhaps laugh at my mode of expreſsion , mais telle est ma façon ) you are as superior My Miranda in yr . feelings to ye . World in general as man is to ye . brute species . I had a great deal more upon certain topics to say to you had I seen you , wh .. I shall preserve till I come to London , as I promise & believe you pray believe me when I say so yt . my correspondance with you there shall be as constant , as far as it is in my power , as it is here . Ad . Ad . Ad . my ever dearest Miranda , may you ever enjoy these bleſsings wh . compose ye constant Prayers of , Yr . Yr . Yr . Palemon toujours de même . P.S . I shall endeavour if poſsible to write to you again before we change our habitation . I have a very bad cold to night , & a soar throat throat , however hope by ye me an s of some Hartshorn & a black Ribband to be well Tomorrow , pray tell me how you escape Colds this Weather . Let me recommend to you to walk as much as poſsible when it is fine when you come to Town . ( a little bit selfinterested ) A . A . A . toujours chére
