Paris Augst : 17 th : 1787 Whilst my Dr : Boy is asleep , I can write a few Lines to you my Dear & kind Friend to tell you & your worthy Husband , how very very much Ly Cremorne & I are obliged to you & to Him for the friendly offer you made us . The Plan as you see is changed , but we can never forgot the kindneſs you intended us . I wrote to you a Line from Calais -- & if I had had much Comfort or indeed any to have sent you , I should have written since ; but I have not -- The Dr : Boy was very ill at Amiens , & my days Time is past in constant anxiety , & earnest Endeavours to become resigned to the Will of that gracious & all wise Being , who alone knows what is but for his poor dependent Creatures . I fear change of Climate will do no good -- tho ' the Air is delicious for those who can bear heat ( my Dr : Husband wd enjoy it if he could enjoy any thing -- & my Dr : Boy is not overcome as I sd : have expected by it . ) He is thinner than he was when we left Calais , & tho ' his Cough is certainly leſs frequent & his Pulse better -- his great thinneſs & Looks are very alarming -- not only to me , & to my anxious Eyes -- but to all around me -- He has had a good Night , but he is heavy , & now asleep after his Breakfast , & his looks make my Heart sink within me . Last post brought me an acct : of Dr : Lord C—— being ill of a violent Cold & Fever & as she complains of the sultry Weather , I trimble lest She should have a return of her bilious Fever -- do my Dr : let me know when you write to me , how She is -- tho ' She promises me to send me the truth -- She complains of her Head & Eyes & bids me not be alarmed if Ly : Wake writes for her next . I pray God She may be soon better . I rejoice to hear you & yr : best Friend & your Dr : little Marianne are well -- God Bleſs you all -- pray kiſs the little Dear for me & tell her , I love her for her Mother 's sake . My p oor Dr : Husband has still the pain in his Head at times , but upon the whole he is better , tho ' sadly wretched about our poor Boy , as to myself -- I begin to seem inured to anxiety & sorrow -- & If I cd : think of my poor Husband being better able to bear his Trials , I feel as if I could paſs my future Life in tranquil sorrow & resignation -- God grant I may poſseſs the last bleſsing Sunday Augt : 19 . Another kind Letter from my kind Friend . I can only add 10000 Thanks & tell you our Dr : Boy has been better those 2 last Days -- we are going I hope in a Day or two to a lovely Villa at Paſsy -- sweet Air & near the Bois de Boulogne -- where I hope he will find benefit -- if it please God . I have only time to say I am yrs : very gratefully & affly : Louisa we are all in better Spirits . to Day . I hope you are all well . -- PC & Ld : C . kind Love They join me in grateful Acknowledgements to yr good & worthy Husband . pray tell Him how very much obliged to him we are & to you Dr : kind Friend Thos : Taxal near Chapel le Frith Angleterre Derbyshire
