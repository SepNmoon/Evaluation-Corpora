Dear Sir , I receiv 'd your letter of the 1 st . of this Inst . which I shou 'd have thank 'd you for immediately had I not expected the favor of another letter from you in a few days after with Robert 's Account ; that letter is now just come to hand , & as you might be sure I cou 'd have no objections to make to it , I am sorry you did not inform me at the same time where I might pay the money which I am ready to do with a thousand thanks as soon as I receive your instructions , or if you think proper you may draw upon me for the amount , by a Bill payable at sight . Two Dogs arrived here from Taxal some time ago , but for what use I do not well understand , & Robt . has been endeavouring to sell them , but without succeſs . Upon your kind information I got him to write to the Servant he had so imprudently engaged , to put him off , & a letter has been receiv 'd from the man with great lamentations for his disappointment . A letter was also wrote to the Watch maker at Manchester , informing him that as the Clock was not finish 'd to the time promised , it wou 'd not be received . I have with much difficulty persuaded Robt . to give me a true state of his debts , which do not exceed one hundred & thirty pounds ; upwards of sixty of which are for Telescopes & Air Pumps bought at different shops , the rest for trifling Bills & money borrow 'd , for the whole I have taken upon myself the payment , which will be final on my part ; for what debts he may contract hereafter , he must be himself responsible , as well as for the consequences . I propose to make him an allowance of £300 . pr . Annum which is fully as much as he can expect from my Income ; my Father had nearly twice as much , when he allow 'd my Brother only £200 . Robert has aſsured me most solemnly that he will break off his connexion with Risman , I shall however endeavor to strengthen this promise by a penal obligation . Robt . for the first week after his arrival was silent to a surprising degree , but he has of late become much more cheerful & I must acknowledge behaves very well . I do not put it in his power to dupe me any further & I keep him at a very small allowance , which I shall do till our agreement is completed , when he may dispose of himself & his money as he may think proper ; he is determined he says to return to Kiel for the object of improving himself , which he chuses in preference to any other place , as there are no English there & as his money will go there much further than in any other place . I beg to repeat my sincere thanks to you & Mrs. Dickenson for the kind interest you have always you have always expreſs 'd for this young man & hope the time may come when he will be throughly conscious of his obli gations to you both ; I do not altogether despair of his amen dment , he now perceives that a perseverance in his errors must be fatal , & this reflection may probably make him more cautious . It was not in my power to avail myself of your obliging invitation to Taxal having much busineſs to detain me here I beg to unite my best Compts . with Mrs. H . ' Robt . & my Daughter 's to you & Mrs. Dickenson & remain Dear Sir Your Obliged & Affect . Humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton N o . 2 Portman Square September 24 th . 1792 John Dickenson Esqr .
