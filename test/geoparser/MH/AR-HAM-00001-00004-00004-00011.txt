Sat . Morng 24 Janry . 1784 I send you , with a fare well pang my head of Jupiter & I send the Sulphur of the damaged Piombino Augustus with the Name of Dioscorides thereon , & which proves plainly that The Augustus is the work of the same celebrated Artist . Be so good as to present both to the Ducheſs I will if poſsible wait upon her Grace by 3 o'clock -- The bills which are in her Grace s pocket book very unprofitably woud save me 5 p r . Cent which I am paying ; if the busineſs therefore can be closed I shall gain & the Ducheſs will not lose -- I think I think the inclosed receipt wou 'd secure the Ducheſs in Case any accident shoud happen to me before the Vase is deliverd to Her Grace -- There Cipriani will begin his drawing next week but He is not to be depended upon I had as soon wish that the Ducheſs woud keep the Vase till He is ready to make the drawing as have it myself for I have daily plagues upon the Subject Yours most affly My Dear Niece W : H .
