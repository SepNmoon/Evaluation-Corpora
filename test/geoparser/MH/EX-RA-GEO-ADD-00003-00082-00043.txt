May I , may I , may I , my Friend , if it is not too much for you , ask one more favor of you , that if we should ever be compelled to separate which Heaven forbid we ever should ( at least I hope our hearts never will , mine I am sure will ever fondly doat upon you ) you wld .. not make my friendship my affection , or my Love for you suffer any anxiety on yr . account , either from ye . ignorance of ye . place of yr . retreat , or of ye situation or state of yr . health , or of ye . sort of life you lead , or line of People among whom you live , most of these circumstances which I have mentioned are included in ye . promise , by which you voluntarily bound yrself to me , but I wished you to make it more circumstantial ly , pardon O my dearest , dearest , dearest Sister if I have erred in requesting this this of you , consider ye . motives of this my behaviour conduct , th t ey proceed totally from ye . sensations I feel , yt .. m y comfort , repose & entire happineſs thro ' life totally depend s upon ye . continuation of yr . friendship .

This Letter will perhaps appear a little too serious to my dearest Sister , considering as I am now in so comfortable a situation with regard to her , but O my dearest Sister O for Heaven 's sake consider where O where I shall find such another Friend as yrself , I want no other , I wish to preserve you you who are so really my friend . I take yr . Meſsenger this time with me to W.—— when you come on T—— there bring an answer with you , I hope I need not ask that it may be a favorable one as you love me , I entreat you so to do or if you like it better bring a v erbal one . I hope this little chit will be well enough to let you come , it will be an age to me until you do .
