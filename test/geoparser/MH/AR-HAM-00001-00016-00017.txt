Dover St December 9 th 1783 My dearest Friend -- I have refused going to Lord Dartrey s this Evening on purpose to write to you , and tell you my feelings , tho ' they are much beyond the Power of Description , even by a much better writer than I. I do not know I ever experienced such a disappointment in my Life as the news you sent us of Your farther stay . With what pleasure did I look forward to the approaching Day when I was once more to see my dear Friend . How had I cun counted the Days I may even say Hours , and Minutes ; and looked upon the whole as so much lost time till your return . I am sure I may safely say it was the first thing I thought of in a morning and the last at night . It was my only consolation for our be ing in Town , and your being absent for these 3 Weeks , that we should have one fortnight comfortably together ; and now see how all my hopes are vanished ! If we meet at all it will only be to part again ; to part perhaps not to meet again this Winter ; for if once the Northamptonshire Clay lays hold of us , I fear it will detain us the whole Winter . And then I shall have no other method of conversing with the dear object of my Heart than by letter , and that I fear not half so often as I shall wish . I think you pity me ; perhaps you only laugh at my Weakneſs ; Your Friends that you are now with are much finer and greater than I am , or ever shall be , and have much greater Powers of amusing , but that may not make them more sincere ; I only hope that some occasion may happy happen to shew you that tho ' your Friend is much humbler he is quite as sincere , and I really think it from my Heart ; that I would willingly and chearfully part with my Life , and any or every thing I have in the World , could it be of the smallest service to my dear Miſs Hamilton . Indeed if I was not to act so , I should be most ungrateful as you have always been my kindest monitor , and Friend , and from whose charming Counsels I hope to receive the greatest advantage ; be aſsured I shall never prove ungrateful ; and shall always look upon your approbation as the chief happineſs of my life , and the standard of what is virtuous and amiable . We have been in Eſsex for a day and came to London yesterday in full perſsu persuasion that we should have spent this Evening , with you ; but instead of that we only heard that piercing news ; the account was immediately and triumphantly brought to be me ( by a Person whom good nature forbids me to name , ) before I was hardly off my Horse , with such a face as bespoke the pleasure it the Person had in declaring and the knowledge of the Pain it would give me . I am certain that that Person can have very little aff ec tion regard for you or feeling for me . We are engaged to a Ball at Epping next Friday and I was vain enough to think that you would perhaps have been of the party , not for any pleasure you could have derived from a Country aſsembly , but for the sake of accompanying my Mother who can not go since she has no Lady to go with her ; and therefore we shall be a party from London of six Gentlemen , without a single Lady ; how shocking ! I thought it would have been a pleasant Scheme to me , but since you can not be of the party I am sure it will be quite the contrary ; for I have not seen a Woman I can no endure since I had the pleasure ( perhaps I should say the misfortune ) of knowing you . I fear I have intruded to much on your time already , and I am sadly afraid I have wrote nothing but a a parcel of nonsense , yet I shall have no Scruples in making you read it as that will be some little punishment for the disappointment you have given me if I have you are the cause -- Adieu my dearest -- believe me to be y our sincere , much obliged and ever devoted friend you might have sent your Love to your old Friend in those 7 Sheets you write my Mother . Marianne is really in a very alarming way : I shall never forgive you if you fail on the 18 th .
