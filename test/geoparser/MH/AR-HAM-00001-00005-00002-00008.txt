Park Street 1 Jan . 1787 My Dear the Honble Wilhelmina Murray I was very glad to see under Your own hand , that You was in the land of the living , and settled so comfortably for the Winter Season : Mrs. Dickinson I found on coming to town , at as great a loſs to find You as myself tho ' she owned it was oweing to her silence , which was not my case , and had I known where to direct shd . certainly have sent You notice of our arrival in the regions of smoke -- Lady Stormont joyns with my Sister & self in presenting Yourself and Captain Murray with the compts of the season , sincerely wishing You very many happy returns -- it gives me great pleasure to hear You are so well hope soon to have that of hearing the great event is happily over and of an aditional Happineſs to You and the Familly . I feel glad at Your situation and think as Mr. Dickinson was to be ill it happened very lucky , at the time ; when You could remove with Him ; and be so well settled for Yourself have You seen any thing of Mr. Dickinson since she has been at Bath -- I find it is as crouded as poſsible East Indian Nabobs and Irish Fortunes or , fortune hunters in plenty . -- but I supose You quiet , and keep out of the bustles -- We have had a week of very severe Weather frost and snow , I was in a great bustle ( being You know a good Walker ) to get sandals to convey me safely over the ice , but by the time I got them the frost broke and it is now so wet and dirty that I want Stilts instead of cloggs -- We found our friend Lady Charlotte Murray just recover ing from a long and painfull illneſs which they called the Shingles , but she is now got quite well & in as good spirits as ever -- Mrs. Leland is quite an invalid out one day and forced to keep house three or four : but I dont think she is not grown much older considering -- I can not say so much of Lady Wallingford who I thought looked very indifferrent , but if it is true that She is so fond of H. M . -- her continual attacks must wear her very much the Drawing room was like a Masquerade as to dreſses , and tho ' every body was complaining , that the feathers or flowers of their Neighbours pulled out their powder & hair yet every Body 's cap was equaly troublesome I was entertained when Princeſs Elizabeth was presented ( as a bride ) being tall and dreſst out with feathers -- when she came to Kiſs the hand she would have brushed Mrs. Drummond Smith face with them , if H. M . had not held her head , as back as poſsible & her hand as forward , which however was not a gracefull posture or , a Gracious one -- Your old acquaintance the Queen is come to town but has got an inflamation on her lungs , with which she is at present very ill -- it generaly attacks her on coming out of the fresh air into these smoky regions by what You say there seems little chance of seeing You in it , which I am selfish enough to repine at very much : as I should be very happy to see You : and at present know of no call that is likly to draw us to Bath -- We all joyn in compts to Yourself & Miſs Black who we hope is got quite well -- accept the Affectionate compts of my Sister & Dear Mr. Dickinson s Yours Affectionately Mrs. Dickinson Wilhelmina Murray Park Str . 1 st .
