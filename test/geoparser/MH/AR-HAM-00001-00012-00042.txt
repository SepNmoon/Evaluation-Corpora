Deal Castle . July 3 d . 1782 . Our Dear little Prince looks so charmingly to day , that I can not help taking up my Pen to indulge myself in bragging of it , as my last Letters have mention 'd fresh Irruption ; he now bathes two days out of Three , which seems to agree very well with him , & he certainly is clearer to day in his Face , than I have ever seen him since we came . I had the pleasure of Shewing him Yesterday to Lord North , who made me a very obliging Visit thō he was here at Walmer but for a Short time , his business being to endeavour to get Sea-men for manning the Ships that are in so much want of Men ; he tells me that he & my Lady do not mean to come to Settle here before September , which is the time Lord Guilford usually is at Waldershare . We talk 'd of Lord Lewisham s Match , wch . gives such Satisfaction to all parties . This Mornings Post has brought the Account of the Death of Lord Rockingham , which did not surprise me as I had heard so bad an Account of him the Post before , Ld Fitzwilliam comes into his great Estate , with a Charge of Fifteen thousand pounds apiece to his three Sisters , Ly Mary Milbanke , Ly Charlotte Wentworth , & Lady Harriet Sturgeon , & how near , for want of his having Children , does this vast Estate come , to young Sturgeon Ly Harriet s Son , who in failure of Lord Fitzwilliam & his Brother ( a poor Sickly Young Man , ) stands heir to the whole . I am afraid the Death of the Bishop of Salisbury makes a great difference in Lady Mary Hume s Situation as to Circumstances , which I am very sorry for . I beg my Dear you will present my humble Duty to their Majesties & their Royl Highneſses & accept of my thanks for your last Letters , Mrs Feilding sends her Love to you . Ever most sincerely & Affly . Yrs . Charlotte Finch Com̄ps to every body .
