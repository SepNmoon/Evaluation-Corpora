James street . Weſtminſter . 25 th . June 1778 My deareſt Miranda . After the loſs of that thurſday , which I was under the neceſsity of reſigning to Lord Dartrey upon his recovery , believe me , that I had fix 'd upon five mornings to viſit you , but was regularly diſappointed by some notice over night , requiring my attendance in another quarter ; I thought , that I could not have been depriv 'd of yeſterday morning , much leſs of this : but the same inauſpicious demons interpoſ 'd with the same irreſiſtible obſtruction , & compell 'd me to pour out my affection upon paper , never with reluctance before ; as it was my earneſt deſire of addreſsing Miranda with my perſon , & not with my pen after so long an abſence . You have friends here , who knowing , as eye witneſses , how much I have been in want of conſolation , moſt kindly gave it , and ſuggeſted my full juſtification out of the Pilgrim 's progreſs from that paſsage , where Chriſtian 's companion after many disappointments , difficulties & delays arriv 'd at laſt to his long wiſh 'd -for object , still Faithf ul as ever . You may compare Mrs. Glover to Chriſtian himſelf in a ſtate of deſpondency at one time with a violent cold , at another with relaxation from ye late intenſe heat of the weather , nor wanting her share of buſineſs , which I leave her to explain , when she meets you again with more ardour , than can be contain 'd in a salutation by letter . Though I flatter myself in the expected succeſs of my apology , I remain vex 'd to the soul , that I could not come to tell you inſtead of writing , how much I am Miranda 's Moſt faithful & affectionate R Glover
