June 25 -- 89 -- N o . 18 Queen 's Parade This day my dearest Love I have sent off a Letter to you -- The Earles are gone this morning into Hampse . for a fortnight & then return here -- Mrs. Ford left Bath about 6 Weeks ago -- I hear Mr. Brownlow was so well satisfied with Mrs. Brownlow 's conduct that he has given his son 400£ Pr . An . addition to his Income -- I am glad of it , as I fancy they were distreſsed -- Wed . Drank the Waters -- This morning I was made happy by receiving a Letter from my dear dear Wife of the | 20 | -- I approve very much of yr- Letter to Mr. Fred.k the busineſs he writes about is curious -- and I am of opinion that he can not make a title sufft . for a morgage without your relinquishing all claims ( wch . I think is a convincing proof that you have claims ) upon that Estate -- otherwise the deed we signed was sufft . release -- however every thing that is proper shall be done -- with this salvo -- that I will shew as much attention to this busineſs at my return to you as was shewn by that family to us in Town as & I will be at equally as much expence & no more -- Yr . Lr . to him is exactly what I could have wished and if he ever had the happineſs of poſseſsing finer feelings it is calculated to rouse them & make him blush -- at the same time there is a spirit of independence wh . gratifies me -- Dont fancy that you live in a region of Clouds -- I dare say if there are any Somersetshire people now at Buxton , that they will have the impertinence to exclaim against Buxton Weather now I aſsure you that it is very seldom fair here , and for the last 24 hours it has rained more than 15 & exceſsively hard -- yesterday & today every body complained of Cold and longed for a fire -- Thursday -- This morning Capt Cox left us -- I regret his absence as he was a modest sensible man , has seen a good deal of service & is very fond of his profession when our Madcaps return from Bristol I know not , but it will be too soon -- they live at the rate of at least 3 guineas a day -- drink constantly 2 & sometimes 3 Bottles of Claret after dinner -- one of them , who comes from Barbados & there saw a great deal of the D—— of C—— told me that he is a complete Blackguard in nature -- I hear he talks to women in Sea phrases -- since I have read a pamphlet called the Royal Interview which is a supposed conversation that paſsed between Prince William & the P—— it is ye- best written of any publication of that kind that I have seen for a long time ; in strong nervous language without any party violence -- the K then points out the Opporty . that the P . had of making himself idolized by His Nation -- respected by all parties , admired by all the World -- & his Name & conduct handed down to posterity as a Model for future Princes -- he then points out what he did -- & what would probably be the consequence of his Conduct -- The King lent it to me -- he has taken it to Ireland to shew to his Countrymen -- who 's conduct he can not speak of with patience -- You will expect me to say something about my self as I have now been here a Week -- this day I find myself perfectly well -- the Waters agree with me & to day I am in excellent Spirits & health -- the Sun has shone for 3 hours , between the Showers , which enlivened every body & I recd . so much pleasure from the great improvement I make in playing upon the violincello which I feel -- that I shall be able to do for yr- amusement in time -- that I am really delighted at the thoughts of it -- the greatest earthly bliſs is to have it in one 's power to please & make those happy who are most dear to us -- & surely no man can love a Woman more than your Husband loves you my very dear friend -- I never set about any thing with so calm a determination of conquering every difficulty than In this instance -- My master , who is no flatterer , gives me great encouragement , by aſsuring me that no person can improve faster than I do -- the great difficulty in this instrument , is to obtain at first a proper position of the left hand , without which there can not be great execution -- the cramp in my right thumb reduces me too often to a stand still -- but I am resolved to conquer all impediments . What will you say to me when I inform you that I am learning Italian -- there is a very good Master here , and I could not let paſs so good an opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of that delicate language -- my master is a Tuscan , and seems to have a thorough knowledge of Languages -- he resided 20 years in Paris & now teaches that language ; -- Now you shall know how I paſs my time -- I rise the moment I wake wch . was this morning 20 minutes before 4 -- as soon as I was dreſsd I made myself perfect in yesterdays Italian leſson & then read in Ganganelle 's Letters ( in Italian ) till 6 when I went to ye- bath and returned by 7 -- & till 9 lay in bed -- when I dont bathe , that time is employed in drinking the Waters & exercise -- at 9 I had my hair dreſsed ( which is done twice a day by an excellent Friſseur for 5/ a week ) then breakfasted en famille with Ct Cox read till half past ten , when I go every morning to Madam Davies & stay with him an hour -- from him I go to Signior Borzacchini , where I stay till one -- then to Bull 's library for half an hour to read the papers -- return home to transcribe my Italian Leſson , ( as I learn from a manuscript grammar ) which generally occupies two hours , part of which I steal to make a visit -- reading , dinner , tea , & supper employ the rest of the day -- / I called this morning Thursday for a few minutes between my two leſsons upon Mr. Herschell -- afterwards left my Name at Mrs. Hocker 's & was again unsucceſful at Dr. Fothergill -- at 6 went to drink tea wth- Mrs. Holroyd 's , but as she was going out I stayed only ½ hour -- I have jumbled this letter abominably -- for this is the day have bathed -- this morning has been fair thō cold & I wear greatcoat -- at my return from my leſsons I found that S. Nicolls had called & was surprised to find that a Lady had ans wered it pr oved to be Dr Fothergill -- I am just returned from an agreeable vi to an hour -- She had understood that you was in Bath & was just gog -- to you , as She had called 3 times -- She informed me that Mrs. Holroyd Bath , who 's mother now lies dead & who 's son I believe is dying , that ord 's -- I shall send a note this afternoon & an offer of waiting upon her to morrow -- Mrs. Ord desired me to come to her often , wch . I shall be to do -- on monday I go to Mrs. H—— to a small party -- I called for a few minutes on the Milnes 's this morning -- Pray let Mrs. Rundel kno w how highly obliged I am by her kind remembrance & that I most aſsuredly wi ll not fail in making good the loſs she deplores at my return , as I feel a particular obligation for the care She took in fitting me out with a set of smickets adorned with demi rouffles -- You delight me with your account of our dear Child -- She will be a very engaging little creature in a few Months -- yesterday I saw a girl of 3 years old at ye- pump room wh . is very like Mrs. Morrison only taller than she will be at that age I flirted with the young Lady for a considerable time -- her Father who is unlike any other Father that you know , I have since heard takes the child there to be admired -- do you know any body that wd . be foolish enough to do so ? he told me that the Child could repeat 200 lines of Gay 's fables & c & c -- all those early acquisitions depend upon the ripening of the understanding & is no proof of ye- strength of it -- our child who is very backward now , may know ten times as much as the other , at 12 Years old -- Saturday -- desire Louisa to kiſs this place 20 times where I have sent her as many kiſses -- how I long to have you with me & our little Darling -- it is a pity our finances are so limited , as I 'm sure you wd . make such an excellent use of a good fortune -- but we should be too happy perhaps in this world if we were rich or even independant -- this subject distreſses therefore will take another -- when I had breakfasted & was settg out to Louisa , I recd . two Notes one from Mrs Ord to in vite to invite me to join her party in a country tea drinking this aftern oon as it is right to shew her every civility , I consented -- the other no te came from Mrs. R . -- yesterday she asked me if I was acquainted with Mrs. Holroyd -- I ansd . no & that I had only seen her fine drawgs which was in her company -- Mrs. Hartley said “ O She is infinitely better than her drawings ” -- and her Note , but I will transcribe it , after telling you that She paid me a compliment yesterday wch . I shall keep to myself -- & in the afternoon sent me a political pamphlet -- “ Mrs. H . presents her compts to Mrs. Holroyd She had the pleasure of naming him yesterday to Mr. D—— who desired her to say , that if he wd . favor her wth- his company tomorrow Evg at 7 to meet Mrs. Hartley She shd . be much obliged to him . -- It requires some apology to have sent a pamphlet made so very dirty by the numbers it was lent to -- Mrs. Orde is too much opposition to have been one of its readers ” -- What a delicate manner of telling me that I must not talk politicks -- I have seen Mrs. Hartley She was in excellent Spirits , very pleasant & seemed glad to see me -- You will be happy to hear that “ She saw Mrs. Orde very lately , that he is in the most perfect health -- there is no truth in the report of his Legs swelling -- that he is fat enou gh -- and some people say , his understanding is actually clearer than ever it appeared to be , wch . may arise from his having in some degree left off his unkingly tricks -- the King told me many Anecdotes for which I have not room -- I am going to leave my Name at Mrs. O . s & will put this into the post office my self , as Mrs. Hartley 's servant , tho often called to , will not answer -- I hope to hear that my Sisters are at Matlock -- Adieu my ever dear Wife God bleſs & preserve You & our lovely Girl -- I am most affy and faithfully Yr . . Mr. D . Say everything that is kind to my Father & Sisters for me -- J. D . Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire X post
