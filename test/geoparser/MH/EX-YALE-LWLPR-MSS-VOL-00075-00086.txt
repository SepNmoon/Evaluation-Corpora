Many thanks Dear Madam for your obliging note . I am very Sorry you have been an Invalide but it is the general case . I have indeed been very ill ever since I met you at Mrs. Ord 's . I felt a beginning Cold about an hour before her Coach came to fetch me ; & by the time I reach 'd her house was much ill & cough 'd the whole Eveng so that I was quite ashamed . I had a pretty strong fever all that Night and have ever since been under discipline & unable to stir with violent Cough & Asthma & c I am now I thank God much better but have not yet ventured even to attend my sick Brother & Sister . I shall be happy to see you when you can venture hither with Safety . I have been & still am very unhappy about a beloved Nephew , Captn Mulso , whose Ship has been Mi≈øsing many weeks & can not be heard of . the suspense is wretched & every day grows more painful . I am Dear Madam your obliged and obedt Sert H. Chapone Francis St . Tottenhm Ct road Tuesday M . 21 . 1797 -- Mrs. Dickenson 58 Lower Brook Street Tuesday
