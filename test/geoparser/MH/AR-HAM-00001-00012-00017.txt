Harleyford . Wednesday March 29 th 1780 -- My Dear Miſs Hamilton , Besides thanking you for the kind Letter I receiv 'd from you Yesterday , I am impatient to tell you , how happy I was made in ye Morning by the unexpected Honour of a Visit from their Majesties , together with all the Princes & Princeſses . They were so gracious & so good to me , that I do aſsure you they charm 'd away all my Complaints , ( almost my Deafneſs , ) & I felt nothing for a time but that I was quite happy & delighted to ſee them ; P. William I think looks charmingly , & much improved . I beg you will acquaint my dear Pſs Elizabeth with all this , & tell her I had the pleasure of hearing their Majesties talk with much tenderneſs & affection of her , & her patient pretty behaviour during her illneſs , which I was shockt to find had been so much severer & longer than I imagin 'd . I really hope I mend as to my deafneſs , thō 't is but slowly , Yesterday having happen 'd fortunately to be the best day I have yet had as to my hearing , for I can not get rid of the inceſsant noise in my Head , thō it does not deafen me quite so much as it did . The Queen told me of the pretty Supper you had had on little Mr Murray s , birth-day , & I was vastly pleas 'd you had the use of that End Room , without which you must have been distreſs 'd . Just after Lord Stormont were gone , a Gentleman that dined here , receiv 'd a Letter out of Norfolk , mentioning the Death of poor Ldy . S , which I heard of wth . great concern , as he was so well spoke of , & so much liked & approv 'd in his places . Pray let me know what is become of their Majesties , I have heard nothing of them since I came out of Town , & alas how Mr Humphreys is , & give my kind Com̄ps to them when you ſee them . I am satisfied my dear the Smelts you will do every thing you ought , & I could wish , about the dear Children during my Absence , & dare say they will want for no Amusement no more than Care that you can procure for them . pray remember me kindly to Mrs Schwellemberg & Miſs Hamilton , I find Madelle . Moula is at Windsor , Mrs Chevely told me she had been ill , which I had not heard . poor Miſs Planta I find was very Serious , but he is recovering , & the Spring coming on , I hope will set him up , as well as the rest of us Invalids . Adieu my Dear , I will not detain you longer than to beg my Love & Duty to the Princes & Princeſses , & to aſsure you that I am with the Sincerest Affection Most faithfully Yrs . the K . P. Edward 's best Com̄ps attend you . pray tell me to what amount Charlotte Finch s Loſs is computed To Lady Louisa from Lord Dartrey Governeſs to ye . Pſs 's S t James 's
