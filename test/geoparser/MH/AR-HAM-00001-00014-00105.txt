March 24 1789 Taxal -- My dr . frd . I was often tempted to write to yo . during our beloved & gracious Sovereagns illneſs , but was checked by ye consciousneſs of ye impropriety I shld . be guilty of to intrude during such a season of anxious solicitude -- now that , God be praised ! he is restored to health , there is no reason why I shld- not acquaint you that I was very deeply affected , & a sincere mourner for the dreadful calamity wch . seem 'd to be threatnened , of ye . loſs of our most excell ent Monarch . and , that now , I am rejoicing wth . my whole heart at the happy & bleſsed restoration of Miſs Goldsworthy -- God of his infinite mercy grant that he may long long live with future health & enjoying every earthly comfort & happineſs ! It is I hope unneceſsary for me to aſsure you that I felt ye deepest concern for his Majesty during the times of her bitter afflictions & was also sensibly touched by what I was certain their R : H : the Pſs's- must suffer -- no person , I may venture to aſsert , prayed more fervently for a happy termination to their grievous trial . I was very sorry to hear from her Majesty that you was taken ill at Kew -- but as ye happy recovery of Mr. Digby the King has banished care & sorrow from ye hearts of all his attached & faithful Subjects , so I hope yo u r health is restored & improved by ye . same joyful event . I wld . write to his Majesty but I have cont ented myself by sending meſsages to her thro ' my frd . LyCFinch knowing how much her time she is occupied & ye . numerous correspondents she has -- I beg yo . will present my respects & afft . regards to her . And also that yo . will remember me kindly to all my old acquaintances -- Ly Cremorne . Mrs. Cheveley Miſs Planta & c I congratulate you all on ye present happineſs you must feel . & that yor grief is changed to joy & gladneſs !
