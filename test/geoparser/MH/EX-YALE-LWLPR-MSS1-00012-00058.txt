My dear Madam true friends are the best restoratives to a Convalescent ; & therefore I shall always be glad to enjoy any moments you can spare , & shall be much flattered by the honour of a Visit from Lord Stormont . I am certainly getting better , but snails past 74 , whose Shells have been much smashed & often , do not renew them rapidly . pray say a thousand kind things to Mi≈øs More , whom I hope it will not be long before I have the pleasure of seeing . yrs most gratefully Orford To Mrs Dickenson
