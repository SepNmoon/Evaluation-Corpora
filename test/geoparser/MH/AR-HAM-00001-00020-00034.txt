Tewin Water 17 th : May 1780 . If my Dear Sister imagines my Silence to proceed from a want of brotherly affection , she mistakes the cause exceedingly . Your letter ( 29 th . April ) says , “ I send some letters , read them as they are numbered -- I will send the last next Post . ” How far you have fulfilled your promise , I now leave to yourself to determine . You have desired me to give my Opinion fairly , and fairly you shall have it , at least as far as you have pu t it in my power . Unaquainted as I am with Mr- D . s Character I find the task of deciding upon his Merit or Demerit , the most difficult undertaking I ever engaged in . You have thought proper to withhold some of his Letters from me , particularly that of August 1779 , and the whole of the correspondence on your part , so that my inferences must all be drawn from such hints as his Letters have furnished me with . In one of his Letters he seems to talk of having discovered your partiality for him some Years ago . It does not appear that you have ever denied the truth of this aſsertion , and indeed from several other Paragraphs of his letters , from your enquiries into his political principles , and from the state of his Affairs which he sent you , I am inclined to beleive that your partiality for him is too deeply r ooted to be easily eradicated . Forgive me when I say that your detaining his last letter confirms me in this opinion and consequently leads me to imagine that you have already given him an Answer favourable to his Wishes . While this idea prevails with me , it must be highly improper in me to offend you by disapproving of what I am convinced is your own choice . Before I conclude I can not help taking notice of the last paragraph in N o - 7 . He there tells you that his father now enjoys £ a year . Supposing the father gives up half his income , I can not help considering £ pr- Ann . as too scanty an allowance for you to begin Housekeeping with . This is the utmost I can prudently say . I hope I have not offended you . If I have I must trust to your Generosity to pardon me . I ever am Your Affet- Friend and Brother N—— P.S . Lady Cathcart returns you her best thanks for the news , and begs you will send her some more in your next letter . Her Ladyship tho ' in her 89 th . Year was engaged abroad at a whist Party on Monday last and did not return home 'till near Ten at Night . Yesterday she thought proper to play Cribbage in the Garden , in the Evening & beat all the Gentlemen in the house , not excepting even your humble Servant . This Postscript is put in by her expreſs command .
