Sunday May 19 th : 1782 My Dr : Miſs H . I must not say Hamilton for fear of being formal -- how little you yet know me , to think I can use formality with those I love . I can not paſs over this Day , witho ut wishing you Joy of it ; & I believe no one can more sincerely join with me than yourself , in wishing many & many happy returns of it , to your kind and gracious Mistreſs . -- how very much one 's mind is affected ( at least mine is , ) by different Situations , I am come here to fix my Children , & arrange my House against my Husband 's return -- & to go quickly to Church on this Sunday -- all this puts my thoughts into a different train , to what I know they would have been in , had I been still in theLondon -- at an earlier hour I rose ; I had more quiet time before breakfast to my self ; & I felt a degree of gratitude with the sight of the burst of Spring -- ( wh : tho backward ) is now surrounding me to you I may say that my Prayers were offered up for One -- who tho ' seated on a costly Throne , has I doubt not made her Supplications this Day to the Throne of Heaven -- may She be aſsisted to keep steadily in the path of every Virtue & at length service & an unfading Crown which will last for ever . -- & may we my Dr : Friend profit by her Example , & so go through our Pilgrimage on Earth , that we may by the Mercy of our pardoning God -- be everlastingly blest hereafter . Lord D is not yet come , & I am a little uneasy at not having heard from him since the 8 th : I hope & trust he will come either tonight or tomorrow -- tho ' my Drawing Room is not yet ready . the poor Fringe not yet finished -- notwithstanding this -- I wish he was safely at home again -- Adieu Yrs : sincerely PD My cold is better -- but I am not quite well -- my Children are -- wh : is much more for my happineſs -- I write in great haste pray wish the Princeſses Joy for me of this Day -- I must not presume to wish the Queen -- all my my heart dictates . what delightful great news from the W.West I.Indies I am so sorry Lord D is not here to fire off our little Cannon .
