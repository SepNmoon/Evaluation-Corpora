My dear Sir , I have just now received your letter of the 7 th . Inst . in which you say you are glad I have proposed to have Mrs. Holman 's body open 'd for the benefit of mankind whereas in my last letter to you I most peremptorily forbid it from my apprehensions of the dangerous consequences from the putrid effluvia to the innocent proprietors of the house who have been much attach 'd to Mrs. Holman , & who have a family of young children ; if you have read my letter I know not how to account for your aſsertion . I therefore repeat my prohibition that no such operation shall take place at N o . 50 in Mortimer St . It wou 'd be very cruel to hazard the safety of Persons to whom my dear daughter has thought herself obliged . You have either not received my letter or not read it . Sure I am that I have never written upon that subject to any other person . With your letter of yesterday I received a very absurd one of three lines from Mr. Holman communicating the afflicting information that he had now no hopes of his dear Jane . I feel the greatest poſsible regard & affection for Lady Eliza Halliday , pray tell her so from me . Adieu my Dear Sir , I have written this with great perturbation & remain most faithfully Yours Frederick Hamilton Bath June 8 th . 1810 John Dickenson Esqr . N o . 49 Welbeck Street London
