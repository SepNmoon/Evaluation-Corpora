1 8 7 18 th - Septr 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , I was exceedingly sorry to hear that you have been ill , while I was absent , however I was little comforted by yr Meſsenger when he told me you was better however when he carried you ye N—— I was exceſsively alarmed at first upon his telling me you had been obliged to send for H—— my heart is too much attached to you not to feel in a very severe degree , every little thing that happens to you , nobody upon earth can be more attached to you than I am , not even yr . other Brother , I doubt whether he is so strongly attached to you as I am . -- This Letter I suppose will be written at different times , or in scraps whenever I can catch a moment , however I am resolved I will now begin to draw ye . picture & character of yr . Brother who loves you so much , & which I have so long promised you . I will do it with all ye sincerity , impartiality & truth that is in my power , I will copy my dearest Sister in ye . ingenuous , indeed in ye too impartial & allow me to say rather unfair Character you ſhe gave of y h erself . Yr . Brother is now approaching ye bloom of youth , he is rather above ye common size , his limbs well proportioned , & upon ye . whole well made , tho ' rather with too great a penchant to grow fat , ye . features of his Countenance are strong , & manly , tho ' they carry with them too much of an air of hauteur , his forhead well shaped , his eyes tho none of ye . best , & tho ' grey are yet paſsable , tolerable good eyebrows , & eyelashes , un petit nez retrouſsé cependant aſsez animé , a good mouth tho rather large with , fine teeth , a tolerable good chin , but ye . whole of ye . Countenance is too round , I forgot to add very uggly ears , if as hair is generally looked upon as a beauty , he has hair more than usually falls to every one 's share , but from ye present mode of dreſsing it , from ye immense thickneſs neceſsarily required for ye Toupées , & ye length & number of ye . curls , it makes it appear some greatly leſs thick than in reality it is Such are ye . Gifts which Nature has bestowed upon him , of which ye World says she has bestowed upon him with a very generous hand . I now come to ye . qualities of his mind & of his heart . His sentiments & thoughts are open & generous , above doing any thing that is mean , [ too susceptible even to a weakneſs of believing people his friends , & placing too much confidence in ym .. from not as yet having obtained a suffici ent knowledge of ye . World or of its practices , ] grateful & friendly to an exceſs where he finds a real friend . His heart is good , & tender if it is allowed to shew its emotions . ( I should not mention what I have marked off with lines among my virtues , but among my weakneſses , ) he has a strict notion of honor , rather too familiar to his inferiors , but will not suffer himself to be brow beaten or treated with haughtineſs by his Superiors : now for his vices or rather let us call them weaknesses , too subject to give loose or vent to his paſsions of every kind , too subject to be in a paſsion , but he never bears malice or rancor in his heart , as for swearing he has very near cured himself of that vile custom he is rather too fond of Wine , & of Women , to both wh .. young men are apt to deliver themselves too much , but wh .. he endeavours to check to ye . utmost of his power but upon ye . whole his Character is open free , & generous , susceptible of good impreſsions , ready to follow good advice , especially when he receives it from so affectionate & friendly a Sister as you are . Adieu for ye present I am not content with this character I have not as yet finished it , I will finish it in my next , I have been too favorable I feel for my manifold faults my dearest dearest , dearest , Friend & try to correct them , you shall ever find me ready to lend an attentive ear to yr . advice . Great imperfections & faults , but ingratitude towards you shall never be reckoned among them , my attachment for you shall never cease but with my life , & I shall live & die Yr .. ever sincerely affectionate Brother & Friend -- Pennel Hawkins . toujours de même . P.S . Let me know who goes to Windsor & every thing about it you know in yr . next . A A A toujours chère
