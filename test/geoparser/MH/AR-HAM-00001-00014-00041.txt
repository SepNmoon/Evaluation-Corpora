Mlle desires her love & will most willingly supply yr- place to morrow , I can answer that neither of us ever think it a hard Duty to do any thing that can relieve you . I shall be sincerely happy to see you & embrace you to morrow Evg if you are really able to come . I must do the Princeſs 's justice & say that they really have very frequently inquired after you , & Prſs Augusta has sent her Love , Dr Prſs Elizh is very well , she has got another very Sore Boil , but with the aſsistance of a Smart Gauze Cloak is to go down Stairs this Evg -- they send their Love .
