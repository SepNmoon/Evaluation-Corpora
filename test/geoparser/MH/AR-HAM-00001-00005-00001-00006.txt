Wolverton Friday My Dear Mrs Dickenson Many Thanks for your kind letter & inquiries . I have not yet any good accounts to send you of Mrs Cathcart except that she is now tolerably well the rest of us are perfectly so . For the present I am of course a Prisoner & indeed for some Time past have been so , & when I might have escaped some thing or other always made me procrastinate my constant intention of coming your way , but that happineſs I hope I shall soon have . What gives me great satisfaction is that you expreſs yourself stout & well & equal to the ball at Woburn . Pray remember me most kindly to Miſs Dickenson & tell her I should have the greatest pleasure in meeting her but that one little requisite is an invitation , an article I am not poſseſsed of which I rather wonder at , but under existing circumstances it would probably be of no use to me . As for my Daughter we took her to Stowe last year as it was a peculiar sort of thing , but she is much too young to go any where else . Correspondence between my Sister & myself is rather an uncommon event as we are both much addicted to silence the last letter went from hence & the last account I had of her she was as usual , she is never you know what she calls well & I beleive very much averse to writing which can be the only cause of her silence to you . My principal anxiety is on Colonel Graham s account who was very recently if not now with General Castanos . The aspect of affairs in Spain is dismal beyond imagination & holds out a prospect of general misfortune of which I much fear we shall not escape a share . I united the hands of Mr Hamilton & Miſs H Wynne on Monday he is a Writer to the Signet , brother to Mr Hamilton of Gilchrist near Lanark who married Miſs Campbel of Scha He is of good repute & certainly good figure but not what I should consider as so very preeminent . I expect my Son next week & hope or at least suppose Xmas day may paſs over uninterrupted soon after I hope to write to you again & in the mean while with kindest remembrance to Mr Dickenson I remain Dear Mrs Dickenson your very Affect Cousin AH Cathcart Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzard
