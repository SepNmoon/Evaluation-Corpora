The Provost of Eton presents his most respectful acknowledgements to Miſs Hamilton for her great goodneſs in communicating the very comfortable contents of the inclosed -- He has great reason to flatter Himself that the Symptoms which appeared so dangerous might bring on a crisis , Tend favourably -- Such an event must give infinite satisfaction to all who are acquaint ed with the excellence of the Son & worth of the parent . The Provost thinks it unfortunate that He was not at home to return the inclosed as soon as he had been made happy by the contents -- He shall ever retain a proper senſe of this singular mark of Miſs Hamilton 's benevolence -- Ap : 8 . past 12 in the Evening Lord Winchilsea 's Illneſs
