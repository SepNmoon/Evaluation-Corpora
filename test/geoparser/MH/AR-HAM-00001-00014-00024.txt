My Drst Tho nothing has happened hitherto to make a Letter very entertaining yet will I scrawl a few lines to show you my good intentions . The Heavens are not propitious , which is no small misfortune , for exclusive of Windsor not appearing in its full beauty the Mud we paddle through to go to the Castle is beyond your conception , we walked upon the Terras last Night notwithstanding Showers & the consequence of Showers very wet Gravel , & nothing but Boots I think will do this Afternoon , yesterday very thick Shoes were paſsable , our Evg was pleasant as usual & as King played at Cheſs not much standing . I am sure you will be glad to hear that notwithstanding the damp walk & cc , that I am really very well , & wish you may have slept half as well as I did . Love , Kiſses , & duty to the dear little Royals , I have not told any body I am writing therefore can only aſsure you my Dst of my Sincere Affection MCG -- Sunday Morg Queens Lodge
