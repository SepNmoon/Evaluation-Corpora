My dear Mrs Dickenson You can not but imagine that , that part of your letter to Fanny which related to me has given considerable uneasineſs , not from any consciousneſs of having acted wrong but from the idea that I have lost the friendship you have ever Shown towards & which I can with sincerity aſsure you I shou 'd ever have been most anxious to have retained . With regard to my own Conduct I can only say that whatever I have done has proceeded from the motive of doing what I thought right , therefore if I have erred it has been through fear of having thought ungrateful by those to whom I owed so much -- Had I left the Bishop immediately upon the death of his Wife , when he was in the deepest affliction for her loſs , I can not but think it wou 'd have appeared very unkind and the more so , as at that time from circumstances in his own Family he was prevented having either his Son or Daughter with him ; I confeſs I did not think the world cou 'd be so illnatured as to spread reports of the nature you allude to about me , & it was still farther from my thoughts to suppose any of my Friends wou 'd believe them , but altho ' that seems to be the case I do not think my reputation so far gone as to make so great a sacrifice necceſsary as marrying a Man 50 years older than myself & I am sure he will never dream of it for an instant -- I believe he loves me with the affection of a Father but as to any thing more that I will venture to say never entered his head -- As to my being at present here I consider myself much more Mrs Horsley 's visitor than his , ever since I have known her we have been upon the most intimate terms & I have the strongest regard & affection for her & therefore it is not unnatural for me to wish to spend more time with her & as it was her wish also & the Bishop 's particular request I agreed to do it -- I do not imagine any thing I can say will induce you to think otherwise than you do of any Conduct in this instance & for that reason I will not attempt it , but indeed I can not omit writing these lines to aſsure you how deeply I regret having been the cause ( tho ' innocently ) of losing the friendship ( as I fear I have ) of persons I so much esteem as yourself , Mr Dickenson & your dear Daughter I trust you will believe me when I aſsure you that nothing can ever make me forget the great kindneſses I have received from you & which believe me I have & ever shall feel grateful to you all for -- I am most sincerely sorry that what has happened shou 'd deprive me of such valuable Friends , yet I will still hope that the time may come when you will again call me your dear Child , & think I have not acted so wrong ly as you now believe I have -- with the sincerest wishes for the health & happineſs to you all Believe me Yr ever affte & Obliged M J Jackson Palace St Asaph Novbr 10 th 1805
