3 d July 1779 I do not think it prudent yt . yo . let every one know the vein of irony you poſseſs -- I give you credit for all ye . friendly things you said to me this morng . -- but I do not chuse to accept the present , be so good then as to give me a proof of yr . friendship -- take it back without being offended -- once more I tell you I will not -- I never will lay my self under x oblig a tions obligations I have not the power of returning . Adieu my frd . I am with the most perfect sincerity yours
