Albemarle Street Jany : 13 th : 1786 My dearest Mrs : Dickenson My Mother & myself receiv 'd your letter on Wednesday & I take the earliest opportunity of thanking you for it . You ask whether I do not wish to see you , nothing could or would give me sincerer joy , but you say Madam Prudence forbids it , & she is a Lady whose orders must be obey 'd , I think of you often very often , & wish you were with us in Albemarle Street , but a few hours , nay a few days , would not satisf y us , after so long an absence from the friend we so dearly love . The latter part of your letter to my dearest mother gave her sincere joy , she will be happy , very happy , to see Mr Dickenson , pray assure him from from her of a very sincere welcome , but before he comes just write a few lines that we may not be out of the way when he arrives , how our Dear A. Maria will be surprized , & how happy will she be to see her dear brother , we are both going this evening to a private concert at Mr. Reveley s in Clifford Street . My dear A. Maria has mention 'd to you some thoughts relative to my late dear Father 's manuscripts , & she has sent me your answer , I am much rejoiced that you approv 'd of my not giving them into the hands of Doctor Brocklesby , I wish 'd much to consult Dr. Warton , & I certainly will have nothing done till I see him , you advise me not to give even into Doctor Warton s hands a single line of the manuscripts but a fair copy , & that were you M Glover you would transcribe them yourself ; Alas my dear Mrs. Dickenson I am too much out of health for such an undertaking , write to me soon & tell me why you think Copies are requisite ; Mr. Collier call 'd on me yesterday morning to say that he would give me all the aſsistance he could , he by no means advised me to publish the plays first as he said that my Father was much more admired as an Epic writer than a Dramatic , which being the case , he should advise the Athenaid to be immediately publish 'd but without the least alteration , their were two or three things which had my dearest Father been living he would have desired him to have alter 'd , but he said no one else could do it , he added that , that poem would very much increase his fame , & that the plays would then be read with admiration , he also said that as the printer is often very careleſs he would himself attend the preſs , that full Justice might be done to so admirable a poem . I thank 'd him very sincerely for his kind offer , for attending the preſs is a most laborious peice of busineſs ; he approv 'd very much of my waiting to consult Dr .. Warton , & when he took leave of me , he said Miſs Glover you must not suffer any body else but Dr. W .. & myself to have any thing to do with the manuscripts . -- Tell me what you think of his offer , when I see him , I will mention what you say about the engraving from the portrait & likewise the quarto edition . My Mother desires her kindest love to you & Mr. Dickenson . I knew you would be shock 'd with the behaviour of a certain gentleman , he has been at Bath near a month & has never once wrote a single line to my mother or me . I well knew you would be pleased wth . Mrs : Aufrere 's letter , she has always been particularly kind to me , & I hope I shall always deserve her friendship . -- You have heard my poor Father mention a Mr. Ockendon , I have found a great many very pretty things of his writing , & some time or other I shall hope to amuse you by reading them to you . We all unite in best Compts : to Lady Wake Sr. William & the rest of the family Tell Mr .. D—— that the thoughts of seeing him & hearing particularly of you . ( would that we could see you ) will I hope make me quite well , I am but very poorly . adieu dearest Mrs. Dickenson & believe your Sincere & obliged friend M Glover Mrs. Lenton desires her best compts .. to Mr. D . & yr . self .
