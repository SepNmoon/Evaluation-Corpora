Dear Mrs. Dickenson If excuses were good for any thing I shou 'd half fill this side with them for having so long delay 'd writing to you . Mr. Dickenson knows my sentiments & the obligations I feel myself under to you for having so kindly engaged in a task , which has reliev 'd me from much embaraſsment as for a compensation , were not the motive of friendship to me added to it , I am satisfied such a consideration cou 'd have had little weight with you . In the account I gave you of your Friend previous to his coming to Taxal , I certainly did not exaggerate , tho ' at the same time I shou 'd indeed be very sorry to hear from you that you have found it precisely just . Deviations from the lines of justice and truth give me the greatest offence , no palliations can be admitted , nor half amendments , for he that is only a little fal se or dishonest , is restrain 'd by his own apprehensions alone of detection from becoming more so ; the mind must be renovated before a radical cure can be expected . In the letters I have receiv 'd from my Son he has never fail 'd to expreſs his sense of the attention & civilities he is daily receiving , I fear the returns he makes to you are not adequate to them . I have constantly aſsured him that I wou 'd give him ample credit for every amendment in his conduct . My advice lies in little compass , that he shou 'd have the mind & manners of a gentleman & these are perfectly compatible with his period of life . I do not enter into the detail of the errors & incaution natural to youth as I remember the time when I myself gave no great attention to admonition upon such topics . In a few months more he will enter upon a new state & be solely responsible for his own conduct & engagements ; if he adopts an honest manly part I shall be really happy & there will be an union in our interests , but shou 'd he pursue a contrary line , all confidence between us will be at an end , & his plea of being my Son will have no weight when he has no other recommendation to enforce it . I will remember your kind partiality for Robert which has been in great measure the cause of my intruding this discuſsion upon you . Whatever my apprehensions may be I am very desirous of knowing your opinion of him . I have observed to him that I think I perceive something more steady in him since his visit to you . We have lately taken poſseſsion of a House in Portman Square , which we have upon a lease , & have repair 'd and furnish 'd at a very considerable expence , it turns out extremely well & we are perfectly satisfied with it . I have as yet received no part of my demand from Mr. Campbell tho ' after giving him a years credit , three months are now elapsed , it is true the money stands at 5 prCt . interest , but as he gave me notice a year ago that he wou 'd discharge his Bond when it fell due I consequently enterd into engagements in expectation of the money & not receiving it I am obliged for the first time to disappoint some of my Tradesmen . The sum to be paid into my hands is £6950 . I am besides to be exonerated from a mortgage of £3000 so that you will perceive that this busineſs is to me of the conseque nce of nearly £10000 . A Thousand thanks to you for an ex cellent hare which we receiv 'd in good order last week . As soon as I receive my demand from Mr. C . which can not be long Mr. Dickenson to whom I beg you will present my affectionate compts . shall have symptoms of it I say nothing of compts . to Robt . as you may perhaps not think it neceſsary to let him know that you have heard from me . I hope my God Daughter is well Adieu Dear Mrs. Dickenson believe me ever Your faithful and Affectionate Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton N o . 2 Portman Square December 27 th . 1791 . Mrs. Dickenson
