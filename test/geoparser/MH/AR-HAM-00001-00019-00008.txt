Abbey Aprill 11 th 17 7 0 its so long since I was favourd with my Dear Miſs Hamilton s obliging Letter that I 'm almost ashamed to acknowledge the Receipt of it but I trust so much to your well known good Nature & justice that I flatter myself theyll sugest to you that want of power not inclination -- could ever cause my being Sillent to a person I so much esteem & from whom I am so Anxious to receive Accounts of your Pappa & Mamma whom I hope are better now ; than when you wrote last . this is the time all Enemy 's Shift their Quarters : so I hope Mr Hamilton s Gout is by this time disloged : pray tell me soon how you all do both to Satisfie my Anxiety & in token that you are not Angry with me ! both the young folks & I have been Ill with Violent Colds which are quite Epidemicall -- Harriot is confined wt a Cough & pain in her Cheast but begins to be better litle Jane is distrest with Cutting Teeth -- but is a fine Child , & would be a fine Play thing for you the rest of your Cousins beg to be kindly remembred to You Mr & Mrs Hamilton -- Mary sitts by me talking so so fast that its odds if I dont insert some of her Pratle : she asures me she remembers you all -- & has by no means lost the remembrance of Mr Samuel & all his Boys . -- I 've just sent her Away & she desired her compts to you all -- & says she 'll come to see you one day again -- I 'm sure you 'll pity me when I tell you that Mr Napier is upon his March with the Regt : to Coventry & Warwick -- it was thought best for the Children & me to remain here that the course of their Education might not be Interupted -- I willingly make that or any other Sacriffice for their good but I asure you its makeing a very great one not to accompany Mr Napier as being with him did more than compensiate for all the Disadvantages attendant on my hitherto moveable Situation -- & to him who is so much a familly Man ; its no leſs disagreeable we have however agreed that he 's to paſs half the year here the other half with the Regt : & as Winter is the gloomiest time we chose to be together then to make it paſs more Agreeably -- so I expect him again in Octr : while he was on The Wing I realy had neither Spiritts nor time for correspondance -- since he 's been gone I 've been rather worse -- : & realy this is the first day I have been able to Muster up resolution enough to attempt a Letter to any body but himself -- as I think when People are in the dismalls their best way is to be Sillent & not torment their Neighbours with it . He was very Sorry his route did not admitt of his makeing you a Visitt which he will gladly do whenever its in his power perhaps they may be graciously pleas 'd once more to Quarter the Greys at Northampton ; judge if you 'll then see him after or Not ? I dare say your Pappa will join me in regreating the Loſs of Jack Hope 's Ellection -- or rather of his Seat in Parlt : -- I have not been at Hoptne : House since -- but can gueſs they are as litle pleas 'd as I am . Mr Napier had a Letter from yr Uncle at Naples a litle beffore he left this & I have heard since from a Relation of ours who was there ( & much obliged to their Civility 's ) that yr Aunt & he are Well -- I have not heard from Ruſsia later than Janry : last our friends there were Well & in good Spiritts then -- but knew no more of leaveing that Country than when they went there -- . My Br : seldom writes to any body ! but is yr Aunt grown a better Correspondant to your House than she was ? tell me in your next how your friends at Ipswich go on . Your poor Babylonians will be quite Moapt for meer want of Society of their own kind if they remove themselves at this rate ! I saw Miſs Thursby s marriage in the Pappers , the remaining Sister & Mother will now doubly feell the want of Mrs Graehme -- . pray tell me how you go on in your next & how you continue to paſs the time in your Stupid Town -- surrounded by the same dull sett of Mortals ? what is become of yr very fatt Neighbour who made so very unsuccesfull an attempt to convin ce me she could not Visitt ; by comeing to the Card Aſsembly but above all tell me about yourselves which is what Interests me the most accept my best Wishes & present them to your Pappa & Mama -- should any of you come this way the Pleasure of Seeing you would be very Sincearly felt by her who shall ever remain My Dear Madam Your Affectionate Cousin & most Obliged Humble Servt : M A Napier . I heard from Mr Napier from Durham a few days ago who was very well -- He is always much attatched to you Mr & Mrs Hamilton his Son is no leſs so ; he is very buſsie here wt a Variety of Masters & grows a great Boy .
