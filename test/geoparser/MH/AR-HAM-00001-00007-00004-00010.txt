A letter was this morning given me for Mr Fisher , which I immediately perceived came from my dear Miſs Hamilton . Mr F 's absence has given me an opportunity of informing her how happy I shall think myself in executing any Commands she may perhaps have intended for another : His return is fixed for Tuesday next ; he left no orders for Letters to be forwarded to him , nor indeed do I exactly know where he is -- I returnd on Monday last from Suſsex where I have been the last Fortnigt , during the whole of which time I have scarcely had one bad day ; I was lucky enough therefore to see all my Relations & old Friends : The Benefit I have receivd from this Little Excursion is really wonderful ; my native Air has had great Effect on my Health , & this Break in the Chain of diurnal duty has had an equal effect on my Spirits , which either from real or imaginary ills were before somewhat too low . I wish most sincerely you coud change the Scene a little ; your Health surely must require it , & a Request of this nature is in itself so reasonable that I wonder you should have any delicacy on that Head . Bruyeres seems totally unhing 'd & drooping : how then must it be with you whose Attendance is constant and care double ! The Time is not far distant , I hope , when I may expect to see you among your Friends , in which number I flatter myself you still continue to enroll the name of Yrss most sincerely John Farhill Wednesday Eve Miſs Hamilton Queens Lodge Windsor
