Mrs. Dickenson is much disappointed to lose the pleasure of seeing Mr- Walpole this Eveg but shall be very happy to see him next Wednesday Afternoon The Prſs & her Cabal called him Firm , & meant he shd be Obstinate : he was neither , but very persevering ; that is , he woud yeild to any emergency for the present , but always retained his purpose , & reverted to it on the first opportunity . Thus , tho every now & then forced to take well intentioned Ministers , He never kept them long enough for the Nation to reap much benefit from their Services -- the best than can be said of him is , that he was more desirous of doing the power of doing what he pleased , than that he had any thing particular to do , good or evil . He was too trifling to have any great plan of either sort ; but the balance so far inclined to the worst side , than he woud lend himself easily to any mischievo us plans of the Ministers wh o flattered & humoured him but was restive against good suggestions , & ra sh ly consented to the execution , without meditating & endeavouring to baffle their Succeſs ; for his Mind was never active , but when he had some trick to accomplish ; for Deceit requiring only smiles & Silence , disgui it cost him no effort to wear a mask till by throwing it off , he coud disappoint what he had seemed to allow . This was precisely his practice on on the Repeal of the Stamp Act , & on Mr Fox 's India bill . But on the first he had committed himself too far & miscarried . On the second he took care to notify his Aversion to it , as soon as he had consented to its being proposed & enjoind his Servants to vote ag . the very measure that he had permitted his ministers to propose . & then dismiſsed the Those Ministers for proposing what They had no conception of his disapproving . Thus did he purchas ing e triumph by the groſsest Duplicity and barter ed the honour of a gentleman to display the Power of a King . Such Conduct in private in private life woud blaſt an Individual -- but how more shocking to see the First Magistrate of a Country cheat cozen part of the Community he is to protect , by forcing another parts to aſsist him is betraying their fellow Subjects ! Who was disgraced by that Transaction , the Betrayed or the Perpetrator ?
