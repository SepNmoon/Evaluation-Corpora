Caldas July ye . 27 th . 1781 My dear Miſs —— The Letters arrived here but two days ago , that were brought by the last packet , so that yours of June 5 th . reach 'd me no sooner , then the last of June 23 d . and many others of July 10 th . which is the reason I have not sooner acknowledged them , as well as my dear Princeſs Augusta 's 2 delightful ones , I beg you will deliver the enclosed to Her Royal Highneſs , and tell her how much I feel her kindneſs in writing them . I shall by the next post thank my dear Princeſs Elizabeth for hers , and did myself the honor of writing to dear Princeſs Royal the 11 th . of this Month in a Letter inclosed to you that went by the Land Post , and was directed to the Queen 's House , which I hope you have received . You can not imagine how Surprized and pleas 'd I was , to hear of Princeſs Royal s Appearance in the Drawing Room and at the Ball on the King s Birth-day , and give you a thousand thanks for being so particular in your Account of her Dreſs Looks and Manner on the Occasion , and of the Universal Approbation and Admiration she met with , which was the only amends that could be made me , for my ill fortune in being absent on so Interesting an Occasion pray make my Affecate . Congratulations to her Royal Highneſs upon it . I am very happy nothing hinder 'd you from being an Eye Witneſs of it it must give us both such singular Satisfaction ; and I feel delighted to think , what pleasure it must have given to their Majesties to see her Acquit herself so well ; and answer every wish they could form about her . That Day we celebrated here to the best of our power , carrying our Band of Musick to a Beautiful Wood about 5 Miles off , that stands on a Lake which we croſs 'd , and almost cover 'd with our number of little boats , the Musick accompanying us . The Dinner Cold and Hot was served on a stone Table under the Shade of the Trees , at which Table as appears by an Inscription near it on Stone John 4th . of Portugal ( in whose Person this Crown was restored to the house of Bragenze ) dined himself in the year 1645 . One of his Succeſsors John 5th . which two of his Sons dined here in 1714 . And this Table has Obtain 'd the Name of Mesa Real in Portuguese . here we all drank his Majesty 's health , and all our Royal Family , which was accompanied with Hundreds of Viva 's from our Guests , which were as many English and Portuguese as we could aſsemble together . The Scene was beautiful , and it concluded with a Universal dancing of all that could attempt it . Poor Lord Winchilsea could not , tho ' he was determin 'd not to be absent on a day he was so anxious to celebrate , so he and I sat as Spectators only . I have not yet seen Mrs . Fielding but am still every moment expecting her from Porto . Your Account of the situation and Disposition of the Lower Lodge at Windsor pleas 'd me vastly and I do not wonder you are so pleas 'd with it . I beg to be kindly remember 'd to every body and am glad Madlle- Moula is return 'd and in such good Looks and Spirits . I form every day stronger hopes of being able to return to England by some good Opportunity that shall offer , after we leave this place where Lord Winchilsea is now going to begin the Baths for which they now think him strong enough to venture : he is certainly mended lately in that respect ; but is still subject to the swelling of his Legs , and not free from Pains about him . Adieu my dear you can not make me happier than by writing when you can . Hart . sends her Love . I am ever most Affectly . and sincerely Yrs . CFinch Ldy . C. F . Copy of a letter from Lady C : F——
