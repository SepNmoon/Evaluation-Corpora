My Dear Miſs Hamilton I beg you will present my humble Duty to her Majesty & inform her , that I have not been able to get any Intelligence about the Duchess of Ancaster , Lady Caroline Egerton had heard nothing but the Meſsage from the Houſe that she was as well as could be expected , from which at least one may conclude she has hitherto escaped the Infection . Their Royl . Highneſses here are all perfectly well & send their Duty , they did me the honour of breakfasting with me this Morning in my Garden , & I have now just taken my Leave of them . I have rejoiced in this fine Day for their Majesties at Windsor , the Terrace must have been delightful . The Gardens here have been as full as poſsible , & amongst the Company I heard of Lord Shelburne & his Future , they are to be married on Wednesday next . I hope your sweet little Royal Trio are well & beg my Duty to them . believe me ever my Dear Miſs Hamn . Most faithfully yrs . CFinch Kew . Sunday Night ½ past ten . Lady C. Finch Queens Lodge Windsor
