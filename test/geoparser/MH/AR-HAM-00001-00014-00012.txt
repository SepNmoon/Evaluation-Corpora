¾ pt 8 Good Friday -- 2 d . April 1779 You are now my Dearest , standing at the Marble Table , admiring the Beauties of Andromeda ( every part of whose Person I know by heart ) but yet I think it not unlikely but that you are thinking of your Nursing Friend at Kew , you know we often sympathise therefore I may perhaps not be mistaken , I had not a General to comunicate my though ts to last Night , but I thought of you at the time you was talking of me , I feel perfectly easy for my Vanity prompts me to think y e said nothing but what would have rather increased it then diminished it , not a little Saucy ; I am determined to keep up my Spirits if poſsible , & indeed they are better then I expected , if God grants me Succeſs , I shall be amply rewarded , Heaven avert so dreadful a blow as the reverse to your Friend , for I know not the consequence , it appea rs to me at present that I should never support it -- the Dear little Angels are in vast Spirits & vastly good , I could fancy Prſs Mary changed a little , so did the Queen , indeed her present Character is uncommonly lovely , I think if poſsible I doat upon her more then Ever , Dear little P Adolphus , is I aſsure you ten times more amiable then before -- I am very glad you got to Mrs Vesey 's I think you must have been well entertained -- Adieu my Dearest I rejoice 4 fievres has not killed you -- write when you can & believe me most Affly Your MCG -- Miſs Hamilton Queens House
