It has not been want of Affection I do aſsure you My Dr Miſs Hamilton that has kept me so long silent , nor will I go about to make excuses for having been so , but tell you the real truth which is that having suffer 'd a great deal in my health upon our journey here , my Nerves remain 'd for some time in so weak a state as made writing very irksome to me , & since they have got stronger , I have liv 'd so much in publick , & have got such a habit of lazineſs in private , that I have behav 'd most shamefully to all my correspondents , all this I hope you will forgive as my hand & not my heart has been to blame . Our Summer here has been hitherto very favourable to our Northern constitutions -- it has been very seldom more than agreably hot , & we have often had very refreshing rains -- we have a very comfortable Society here , particularly in the French Ambaſsadors family , whose daughter the Comteſs de Chatignon is a most amiable young Woman we make parties upon the Water very frequently , & are together every day which I think is the comfort of Society , a comfort one can seldom enjoy in England where if you enjoy the com fort pany you like one day , they are most likely dispers 'd diverse different ways the next -- I hope Mrs Hamilton continues to enjoy her health & that she has now recover 'd her spirits in some measure for she realy made me quite uneasy ( as I have a regard for her ) to see how the uneasineſs of her mind prey 'd upon her ( naturally good ) constitution , I saw likewise how you suffer 'd for her , & that render 'd you still more amiable , I should be happy to hear there was some prospect of your being well settled , I know that would do Mrs Hamilton good , as her heart is wrapd up in you -- I beg My Dr Miſs Hamilton you will continue to let me hear from & every thing about you & Mrs Hamilton to whom I beg My kind Love Sr Wm . joins in the same to her & you & I am My Dr Miſs Hamilton Yr Most Affectionate Aunt & Sincere friend CHamilton Naples Augst . ye 17 th by London To & only Miſs Hamilton at Northampton Inghilterra
