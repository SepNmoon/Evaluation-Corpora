Queens Lower Lodge Windsor 29 th Novbr 1783 My Dear Miſs Hamilton I am sorry I can not give you so good an account of Miſs G , as you and I wish her -- but her breast is still very painful , and I believe a nother bleeding is to take place -- she has had two blisters already -- and I beleive two bleedings -- but notwithstanding all this I do not think her worse than I have often seen her on former occasions -- and hope a very few days will make a great alteration for the better -- I am in the middle of the most momentous busineſs , dreſsing my hair , and must you know , be ready to the minute -- therefore can not say half what I wish -- I cou 'd like to have a Cot of my own to receive You -- as these Walls are too large -- but the cruel fates decree otherwise -- but when we come to Town this grievance will be removed -- till when and at all times I am most sincerly Yours L Cheveley past one oclock
