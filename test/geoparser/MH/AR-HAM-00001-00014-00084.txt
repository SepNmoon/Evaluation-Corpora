pt 10 Monday Night My Dst I really have not had time to day to answer your kind Note , which gave me great Satisfaction , I hope to hear you are as stout to morrow but pray do not be too much so , for I know what illneſs is , I hope you will not again be so well acquainted with it , nor never so much so as your Mama Goldsworthy , hope you have heard that my Brother has constantly enquired after you , he has interested himself very much , so indeed does every body here . Adieu my Dear Child , I am vastly Stout & you will find me quite fat I had an oportunity of doing what you desire me to Dr Turton to day the more you know him the better you will like him God Bleſs yo u Affly Yr- MCG -- Miſs Hamilton St James 's
