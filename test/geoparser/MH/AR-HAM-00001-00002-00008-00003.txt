25 Feby- 1786 -- I mounted my horse at ½ past one and called upon Robert at Kensington -- it was with some difficulty the young gentleman could be prevailed upon to come to me -- as he was / Schoolboy like/ -- very dirty -- he looks very well , wch . at his Age is very desireable -- I went on to Chelsea -- to call on Robert Hamilton & Mr. Antrobus and to see what was going on there -- Thomas has taken down the room with the painted Glaſs and is going to build a library 30 feet long , and another room where the green house was , with Rooms over them for the Accommodation of Ld . C . and his worthy Tutor , I call 'd on Thomas who desired me to make many very pretty speeches for him to you -- at ½ past 3 oclock I galloped home , dreſsed and went to Stanhope Street -- Mr. Lawton and Mrs. Carter were there -- I shd . have known the latter from yr- description -- She did not vouchsafe to honor with one word -- but I cd . see her Eyes a little inclined to my side of the Room very frequently -- ½ past 4 Mrs. Iremonger began to be impatient & a little on the pet as Ld . C did not appear , and dinner had been ready half and hour & my good Lord s appetite was very keen -- I can not say that had any objection to his Solicitude on that Acct . as I felt the same Inclinations -- in consequence of my Gallop -- at length the Lady made her appearance -- and a curious one it was -- she was dreſsed in une Chemise de la Reine -- which is the most unbecoming dreſs I ever saw -- After dinner we were amazed by looking at 40 miniatures of Lady L——n s -- She has done 330 -- Lady L—— & Lady L . & Mrs . I left us early -- Mrs. Carter went also to a whist party Ld . C . was going to a Ball -- I did not stay long -- dear sweet little Lady C . came in & wrote her name & sent her Love to you -- She is every thing one cd . wish in a Child of her Age , and in spite of her teeth will be very pretty -- there is something Angelick in her Manner -- she is all gentleneſs & Innocence -- I came directly home -- 26 -- I breakfasted with our Sister , at eleven called on Julia & good Mrs. Vesey & took leave of them -- then I took leave of Martha and went to Mrs. Walkinshaw s -- Lady Warwick recd . me in a friendly manner -- his Room smoked & we went down to Mr. Greville s Room -- there was an odd looking man with him , whose Eyes looked different ways & gave him a ridiculous appearance we heard several of the G—— s stories and then went up stairs again -- Gl . Clarke shewed me his plan of in Collecting & his models in wood of Angles octagons & c wh . is the only ground work to form a true judgement of Minerals -- I was very much entertained as he understands the Subject so perfectly -- we went thrō his Chrystals and then & Mr. G . & two Ladies , ( one a Collector ) came in , & who wished to see his ores -- by this means I saw more than I otherwise sd . have done as I cd . not have given him so much trouble -- his Cabinets are curious & well contrived -- He laughs at the Portland Collection , & says there is not a single Specimen that he wd . purchase -- I was obliged to tear myself away as Dear Sir Abraham Hume dines early -- Mrs. Delany gave me his hand , & said he should be very happy to see me again , & sd . take great pleasure in shewing me his Collection -- I call 'd for 5 Minutes at Mr. G . 's -- who has been ill -- but is recovered -- She & Mrs. Ord desired their Love to you -- Miſs O—— shook me by the hand -- said she was very much obliged to me for calling upon her & wished me a good journey -- she told me that Mrs O—— is coming to London -- I found Mr. Smet very well -- thō She had been tormented with a great deal of Company I spoke to her abt . the Letter in wch . you wrote Smelt s Character -- She said she had not received it -- Mrs. Delany came in at that instant wch . prevented my saying any more on yt- subject -- She spoke of the short visit I made her on friday -- I said I left her with great Reluctance , & shd . not have gone so soon if Mr. Glover had not been there -- She said -- She concluded at the time that my usual discernment prompted me to suppose that Mrs. Dewes wished to have some private Conversation with her -- Lady Weymouth told me that she had been at the Queens House on friday -- She went at 11 and stayed till 2 -- Lady W . saw her in the drawing Room & Mrs. D—— led her by the hand into her own apartment -- The King asked where you was the Q . told her ( what she knew before ) that you was with your friend the Q . & mentioned the occasion of your visit -- & said “ Mrs. D—— 's Father proposed it to Lady W . Mrs. D—— said “ Mrs. D—— never forgets her freinds and always acts properly ” -- the Q . said -- “ I shall stand up for my freind Mrs. D—— -- he makes an excellent Husband & I think him deserving of Mrs D—— ” That my Conduct shd . be approved of by Mr. D , is not only very flattering & a great honor to yr- Mrs. D—— but it adds to the great happineſs he enjoys in being your husband -- Mrs Delany Dickenson two Mrs. Dewes dined there -- after dinner , to my great Confusion Mrs . Port asked Mrs. Sandfords if she had had a L—— from you giving an Acct . of Mrs. Delany -- I took no Notice Miſs P.Port said . Yes -- but She did not know when it was -- Mr. Glover took an affte- leave of me , and said another year before she shd . see you -- I took leave of Miſs P.Port -- she had not been well in the afternoon but was better -- and said many kind things of you -- Mrs. D—— desired me to tell you that he would come to Buxton in the summer to finish the game of Cheſs -- 27 -- I took leave of my good friends last night and got up at 6 this morning to return to the faithful arms of the best of Wifes -- at 7 it snowed so fast that I thought it wd/ be Madneſs to venture to set out -- the day continues as bad as poſsible and when I shall now have the happineſs of seeing you my dear Lady Herries , I can not tell -- I shall not delay a moment as I long to see you and to tell you how sincerely you are beloved by Your own Sir Robt . I forgot to mention abt . the Dog -- it is probable I shall not shoot next year , as I am become very indifferent abt . it -- therefore Mary had better dispose of it -- Adieu Adieu the bell rings -- Who is John Dickenson the mineralogist ? -- Sir Wm . ? Mr Grenville ?
