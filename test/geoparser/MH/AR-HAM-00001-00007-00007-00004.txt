Tunbridge Wells 14 Aug : 1782 my Dear Miſs Hamilton if you have half the rain at Windsor we experience here , think you will be anxious to know we are safe , and as yet not washed away by the floods , which are said to be high ; but , upon Mount Ephraim , we only see the w h et , without having that inconvenience -- the weather however , is very mortifying ; as it certainly must en the spring , and consequently , the water can not the same service . my Mother is , notwithstanding much better ; a proof of her being so is , that she atended the Duke of Leeds 's invitation to the Ball , which he an̄ualy gives on the Prince of Wales 's Birthday . -- as I had never been at one before , was much entertained at the ceremony . tho ' the Bad Weather , spoilt the gayest part of the show : as the Walks are dreſst with Bows & Lights , and filled with company , all dreſst in gayest fancy -- his Grace , was in the rooms at six , to receive the company ; who all in smartest dreſs , walk up to pay their compts : Lady Morton , as the first Lady here , was the Queen ; after the tea Drinking , the Duke handed her to the Upper end of the room , where he seated himself , next her ; as she thought it staring to sit alone , more chairs were brought Lady Brudenell , & Lady Mary Bligh , sat on the other side of his Grace Yr . Humble Servant next the Counteſs ; Ly . Mary Bowlby , my mother , Miſs Manners ; Mrs. Butler ( Ly.Darnley 's mother ) behind ; the minuets then began , Ly . Mary Bligh with a Mr. Beaufoy , formerly a Quaker and vinegar merchant , but now a very fine Beau , opened the Ball ; making their compts ( as at court ) to the K . & Q . of it . the exhibition of Dreſses afterwards , as well as dancers , ( for few kept time , ) was truly amusing : the master of the ceremony 's to save himself trouble , is trying to introduce long Lappets , for the minuets . so the Ladies , had Lappets long enough , to sit upon , pin 'd , under little Dancers hats , with Short peticoats : those indeed , that had trains , not knowing how to manage them , were in danger of tumbles : the minuets lasted very long , but when over ; the master of the ceremony 's came up with his Bow , to notifye it . When the Duke and company rose , and he , made his excuse hoping he shd . be excused as an invalid , for going home so early , took his leave . country dances then began , and the usual entertainments took place ; of cards , & c it was very full , tho ' I dont think the company very brilliant , as you will supose , by the Quaker dancing the first . Ld . and Lady Sussex , Ld . Darnley , Lady Mary Duncombe , Sigr . Pacchierotti , Lady Young . & c & c were there , and such a number of faces , one had never seen before , or wished to see again ! made a sufficient croud . Mr. Smith , who I have seen at your partys is here ; a disconsolate Widower , has sold his house in the country , and come here for the summer , with his children . Miſs Finch , I saw on the walks some days ago , but she only came for th e day -- nobody need be sick here , if Doctors can cure ; as there was no leſs than two Bishops , at the Ball , with Lower Clergy in abundance ! and Phisicians , without end . Even Doctor Warren . Mrs . & Miſs Lowths are here , the Eldest very bad , tho ' Warren thought her better . the Bishop has been very ill again , since they have been here ; so that they are in a very distressful situation , between the two sick -- I have been a party , to see Stonelands : ( Ld . Sackville s about 6 mile off ) a very pretty place ; but the House , he wont have shown , about half a Mile Beyond , is Withiam Church , the Burial Place of the familly . where we saw , a fine old tomb , erected to a Seventh son , and thirteenth Child of a Sackville ; the you ng man Lays on the top , the father & mother , as big as weeping on each side ; and round the sides , are the other children ; the dead , are distinguished by Palm Branches in their hands ; the living , by full bottom 'd Wig s it is all marble , and well executed ; tho ' the Statuary , has been too modest to put his name , his work deserves admiration . we also v w ent into the Burial Vault , and saw many Coffins , Sir Ed : Sack : is among them , that fought the famous Duel -- the situation of the Church , & Parsonage , is delightful . Buckhurst Tower , forms a beautifull object , it is part of an Old Gateway , the only remains , of the ancient seat of the Sackville Familly . I took a sketch of it , which I hope to shew you , & give some idea of a very pretty place . I have been busy with my Pencil ; & taken another view , which is that of mount Misery , which makes a pleasing object ; tho ' the name shd . bespeak the reverse . but the names of the mounts , remind one of the Pilgrims progreſs , wish You could come among them , and ramble about with me , among the rocks & c & c Mrs. Leland w : have been in hopes of seeing , but fear , the weather will keep her at Strood . have had a letter , in which she does not seem in spirits , which I am very sorry for . Mrs. Tryon , is near the Camp by Yarmouth , they have all been ill , & fear this weather in so unhealthy a country , will not make them very stout -- I ought to apologise for making you pay for this , but , I never have any franks : and you was so obliging to wish to hear , of us ; besides , I flatter myself , you will follow my example , as I shall take it very ill , if you grudge my pence ; & think me not public spirited enough , to pay with pleasure , for what I like so much . my Mother & sister , joyn with me in best wishes , and am Sincerly Yours Wil : King how does Mad La Fite ?
