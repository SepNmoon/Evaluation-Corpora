Dear Miſs Hamilton I did not expect the Buckles Sooner ; I intended to call for them soon , to Save you the Trouble of sending them ; I Should not have been so long without Seeing You ; but that I have had Many Visits to pay in a Morning , as I do not go out in of an Evening -- I should have requested your Company -- but as I can not offer the Carriage , did not chuse to put You to any Inconvenience ; any Eveng . this Week ; If you can call , I shall be Happy to see You ; Lady Stormont comes to Me frequently -- tomorrow Evening I am to have Mrs. Leland -- as Lady Stormont has few Engagements , perhaps She may come also -- I go to My Br . Robt . almost every Morning -- I am the only Person He admitts , excepting My Mother ; & She sees Him very Seldom ; as He Is not comfortable enough to enjoy any Company -- therefore for the present Is denied to all ; but Me -- He Is all over Rheumatism , excepting His Head ; -- has Had a great degree of Fever ; It Is now so Much Abated , He is taking a Guiacum Medicine , Wh . I Hope will be of great use to Him ; He has no Sleep but wh . opiates , wh . this Help has Quiet Nights -- He Is kept very low as to Diet ; & I am afraid the Disorder will be tedious , but He Is satisfied wh . Sr. John Elliott s advice , & I Hope will find Benefit soon ; -- He sits up in the Day -- but can not walk or stir from His Chair ; We must expect He will be Much reduced but indeed He does not look so Ill , as you would expect ; on the whole He is mending -- but His Recovery will be very slow -- My Eyes are Much Better ; still not strong -- excuse this sad scrawl ; I have been particular in My Acct . of My Br . as I thought It wd . be satisfactory to You ; & my uncle Frederick , to whom My Love When you see Him ; I am dear Miſs Hamilton ever Yrs . Most Affecly -- Frances Harpur Monday Eveng- To Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street
