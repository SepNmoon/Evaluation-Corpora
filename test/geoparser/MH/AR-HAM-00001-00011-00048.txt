Dear Mrs : Dickinson Wherever you are situated you and yours , have my sincere wishes that you may find happineſs ; I have ever so loved the quiet , and the delightful occupations of the Country , and now I am grown old , that love for it , has so much increased , that I can not feel , as many of your Friends may do for you , upon your quitting it , to reside in the tumultuous City -- Probably I might have felt otherwise , had I the Bleſsing still , which I once poſseſsed ; That you and Mr : Dickenson may long , long have your Bleſsing , / your dear & amiable Louisa & that she may continue what she has ever been to you both , is my hearty wish . With Lord Cremorne s & my best Regards to you All , Believe me Dear Mrs : Dickenson Your 's faithfully PCremorne Chelsea Farm 15 November 1809 Lady Dartrey Leighton House Chelsea Leighton Buzzard Single
