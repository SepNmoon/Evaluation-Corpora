I am juſt come home from my Walk , & have read my dear Miſs Hamilton 's Letter with the greateſt Concern . -- Heaven is my Witneſs that I meant not to give her Offence -- What could hurt you at my ſupposing you meant to chatechize me ? -- for I only meant to ſay , you wanted to divert yourſelf a little , by roasting me , as the Phrase is , for my imprudent way of Life . -- It ſhew 'd your friendſhip as much & had as good an Effect as a ſerious Lecture from a Person of matur e Age ; -- & by the Anſwers I wrote , I intended only to ſhew you , there was nothing I would conceal from a friend , tho ' the Subject I ſhould never have broached myself . -- Farewell , my dear Miſs Hamilton ; -- I was not ſo much mistaken in your Character , but I told you before that you would one day as readily take Offence at me , as you had ſhewn a friendſhip for me , which believe me , I ſhall never forget . -- My reſpectful Compts : to your dear Mama . -- I ſhall take the Liberty of ſending ſometimes to enquire after her Health . --
