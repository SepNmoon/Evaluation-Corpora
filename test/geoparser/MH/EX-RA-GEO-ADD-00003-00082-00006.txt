Butterflies , a few minutes before Seven , or exactly as ye Clock strikes Seven , and when I come into the Gardens , I will make some excuse for staying behind , and I will come immediately to you . I will give you my honor I will not detain keep you not a minute , nor shall any body find you out , if you will exactly follow my desires . Adieu dearest dearest dearest Friend . P.S . Excuse my Scribble for I have not been above a minute writing this . Adieu a second time Sunday -- 6 th . May 1779 -- June
