My Dear Miſs Hamilton Mrs Montagu is very desirous to have the pleasure of your Company to Dinner on Wednesday next to meet Mr & Mrs Smelt but Says that she is not enough acquainted with you to take the liberty of throwing a card at you & therefore desires me to ask the favour in her name & I hope you will not have the cruelty to refuse our joint request -- I have a great many apologs to make to you for not having profited by the kind permiſsion you gave me of writing to you last Summer but it is impoſsible within the compaſs of a card to state the case properly but I trust that when you come to know the various causes that combin 'd to prevent my having that pleasure you will see that I was rather to be pitied th a n blam 'd for my Silence Since it did not proceed from Want of inclination -- believe me much yours D Gregory Hill Street Sunday morning
