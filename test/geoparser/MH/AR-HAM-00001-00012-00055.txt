My Dear Miſs Hamilton I have wrote all the particulars concerning myself in answer to all the kind Enquiries from the Queen 's Houſe , in a Letter directed to Miſs Goldsworthy , & did not send it ( as I was but first up ) till she was gone out to Dinner , My Servant says he gave it to Mrs Cheveley who said She would carry it to Pſs Royal ; now I beg the favour of you to let it be open 'd , as it conveys my thanks that are so much due at the Queen 's Houſe , together with all I can say about myself . I was very sorry I could not ſee you Yesterday Evening when you so kindly offer 'd to call , & hope my Servant explain 'd to you my reasons for being obliged to decline that pleasure . I am very Sensible of all your kind attentions & remain my dear Miſs Hamilton Most Affly . Yrs . CFinch Wednesday ½ past 4 . Miſs Hamilton
