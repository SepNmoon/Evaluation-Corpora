My dearest dearest dearest Friend , I hope yr . sejour has been very agreable , at least more so than you thought it would have been . As to ye . invitation you mentioned , I could not help doing otherwise than I did . I was a told by a friend of ye Invite r d that he had seen him where you know , and that he had invited him , but that the other had said he could not come just then , but should be glad to come another time , but that it must be soon for he had busineſs of consequence that would call him into ye Country within a day or acc two , accordingly I was obliged to invite him immediately . I flatter myself that my sweet friend was not much offended with the little caution I gave , if that ever should ever happen again , pray attribute it only to inadvertency . I know you so well that I am certain you do not ſtand in need of it . I beg you will give me an account how you paſsed yr . time and how you amused yourself at —— I am sure that every thing is nothing to me as if you are not present . Pray inform me also if you have heard any reports , whether we are to take another jaunt to —— soon or not . You must think that what I write is very unconnected pray excuse it wherever you find it so for whenever I write it is at little moments which I ſteal par ci par là . Do not be afraid of writing , for I am sure what you write would do honor to any body , Remember what Pope says upon Letters Heav'n first taught Letters , for some Wretches aid , Some banished Lover , or some captive Maid ; They live , they speak , they breathe , what Love inspires , Warm from ye Soul , and faithful to its fires , The Virgins wish without her fears impart Excuse ye blush , and pour out all ye heart . Spe a d ye soft intercourse from Soul to Soul . And waft a Sigh from Indus to ye . Pole . Alexander Pope , Eloisa to Abelard ( 1716/1717 ) , ll.58ff . I have now nothing more to add my sweetest Friend , than that I ever shall be yr . sincerely affectionate Friend & Admirer . Since I wrote this Letter I understand from ye —— that we are to go to —— to morrow Evening . Let me also know when you write whether I am to have ye happineſs of meeting you there , or not . Believe me I ever shall be yr . sincere admirer and affectionate Friend . Adieu .
