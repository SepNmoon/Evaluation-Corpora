Lower Lodge ye 2 8 9 th October 83 I ought my dear to have thanked you much sooner for your kind & obliging Letter , but you know how fully employed my Time is & that besides that I have not the Pen of a ready writer -- I was happy to hear you had pa≈øsed your Summer so pleasantly , nothing can equal the Satisfaction of finding that those we love , really Love us , may you ever have that Satisfaction is my sincere wish -- I hope Lady Wake is quite recovered & that Sir William is free from Gout -- Lady Charlotte is at Burley I expect her in about Ten days . My Brother I am likewise in some hopes of seeing either to day or to morrow , which I am sure you will be glad to know for my sake . News you know I am not in a Situation to hear , we are all well & I have hitherto thank God escaped Bleeding or a Blister -- Adieu my dear I sincerly wish you well & happy & am Affly Yr MCGoldsworthy
