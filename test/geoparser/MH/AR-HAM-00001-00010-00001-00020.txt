To Mr : Dickenson on the Birthday of a certain Lady 5 th . of February 1807 I use the Latin Maria for Mary Rejoice ; my Friend Rejoice the Sun appears Which marks the progreſs of Maria 's years , When virtuous minds attain an age mature Sweet is the pleasure & the joy is pure Should we look backward on her early life , Great is the merit of thy charming Wife Endu 'd with powr 's to fascinate mankind Her stedfast aim was to improve her mind Virtue & Piety adorn 'd her youth -- And led her safely in the path of Truth Each duty she perform 'd with zeal and love , Her Parents bleſsings did her acts approve , Nor yet confin d within a circle small Her warm benevolence extends to all , -- If one she knows is wounded by distreſs She by her kindneſs makes the sorrow leſs , In noble friendship none can her excell I speak who feel for I have prov 'd known it well , By fire the worth of gold we we fully prove And adverse fortune is the test of love She pour 'd the balm of comfort on my bed And chac 'd misfortune from my menae 'd menac 'd head Happy the Husband of so dear a Wife Whose smiles can diſsipate the clouds of life , Whose cheerful converse cheats the tedious hours And strews the thorny way with fragrant flow e rs Oh ; well-deserving long mayst Thou poſseſs In dear Thy Maria human happineſs -- Long may She live exempt from care & pain And in Louisa may you live again Accept the cordial wishes of a friend whose zeal and love with Life alone can end . To Mrs. Dickenſon My dearest Friend as you desire me not to criticize your elegant & most acceptable presents so I trust you will allow for my inability in humbly endeavouring to celebrate your Birth-day but my desire to shew you my unfeigned affection & esteem dictated the Lines on this sheet -- Mrs Glover gave me the agreeable intelligence of your health & invited Isabella & me to partake of the Hare in honour of the day they were much pleased with the kind attention a-propos I have often asked Mrs. G respecting the Letters which she acknowledges but declines all writing as much as poſsible nor could I get her to lend an ear to your kind invitation but she loves & esteems you & speaks of you with pleasure I was prevented the pleasure of dining with her by an appointment I had made to take a Leſson of Mr Moellor in music & as he was to come from Windsor at 6 in the evening I could not find the means of putting him off which I was very sorry for -- I had the pleasure of your very kind Letter anticipating the Box which was left almost at our door as Cheney paſsed through & came in perfect safety -- I unpacked it with great delight but was forced to postpone it until the next morning so agitable are my spirits -- What shall I say to expreſs the sence I have of so many pleasing instances of kindneſs so very pretty & so valuable to me -- I am extremely pleased with all particularly with dear dear Louisa 's exertions to please Mamma 's old friend give my kind Love & aſsure her of the pleasure inexpreſsible & gratitude with which I shall use the eligant Gifts -- my Love to Mr Dickenson I admire the Gown it is the prettiest & at once the liveliest and gravest thing I have seen I do intend to wear it on the 5 th & to spend that day with Mrs. Glover & remember you all return my sincere thanks to him , I was just thinking I wanted a Gown by way of a better one than common but as I am spending my money in learning Handel 's Concertoes accompanied by Mr M I could not have for a long time have afforded one at present I am rich in Gowns the Bodyce also came safe the 2 Shirt Hank are extremely pretty & the 2 Frill s Stocks -- many thanks to you for these the stick came which is very useful the 6 Pocket Hank are remarkably pretty & neat -- the 2 Hand Screws are beautifully made light & elegant -- tell Louisa I shall always look on them with pleasure the Netting Case I am charmed with & it suits me so well because my Playwork is Netting Garters & I shall hope to nett two pair for you two for dear Louisa & two for Mrs. Morrison to whom my kind remembrance remembrance -- tell Louisa I think it the prettiest Netting Case I have seen -- the Pincushion is also very pretty my Sister s Comp to dear Louisa & many thanks for the Pincushion which she thinks extremely pretty in general for all accept my warmest thanks & be aſsur 'd the kind intention is delightful to me I was surprised & shocked to hear of poor Mrs Hamilton 's decease I esteemed her & was gratified in her society her manner was attentive agreeable & obliging -- she was a very fine Woman What is Beauty all is as the flower of the field & c . Perhaps an echo of Alexander Innes , Twelve Sermons Preach 'd on Several Occasions ... ( 1726 : 177 ) , who asks 'What is Beauty ?
