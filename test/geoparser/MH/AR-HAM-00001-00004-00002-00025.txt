My dear Sir , You have laid me under the greatest poſsible obligations by your unwearied attentions to me & my dear unfortunate daughter ; when the fatal moment has paſs 'd I beg you will entrust the care of her funeral to my worthy friend Mrs. Mann . I wish it to be very private , but at the same time not unbecoming the beloved object , every exp ect ense shall be immediately defray 'd . From my regard to Mrs. Mann 's health , & of the Proprietors of the House , who have behaved with great attention to Mrs Holman , I expreſsly forbid that her body shou 'd be open 'd in the House , there is no knowing what a dangerous disorder might be produced by the putrid effluvia ; as this apprehension is is founded in reason , I shudder at exposing the lives of good & innocent persons to any hazard , for the same reason I recommend that the funeral shoud be accellerated ; with my best regards to Mrs. Dickenson & your dear Daughter I remain your Faithful , humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Brock St . Bath June 6 th . 1810 . It appeared to me by this letter that somebody had wrote to Mr. Hamilton to prepare to have the body opened as I should not have proposed such a neceſsary Inspection to him . J D . John Dickenson Esqr . N o . 49 Welbeck Street London
