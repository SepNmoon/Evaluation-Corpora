Madam , Tho ' I received the amount of the Inclosed by the hands of Miſs Hamilton , I can not but ſuppose I was equally indebted to your kindneſs for the Loan of it . But having ſince loſt the good opinion , which then procu red me that mark of your compassion for my misfortunes , I muſt beg leave to take the firſt opportunity , that has been in my power , of returning your money ; yet I ſhall not never think the obligation entirely discharged while I live to render you ſervice . -- As I ſhall poſsibly be called from Northampton ſoon , I could have wish 'd , my dear Madam , to have taken leave of you & Miſs Hamilton in these Lines of Mr : Pope . -- “ Absent or dead , ſtill let a Friend be dear ; “ A Sigh the Abſent claim s , the D ead a Tear . ” Alexander Pope , Epistle to Robert , Earl of Oxford and Mortimer , ll . 13-4 . but indeed I have had a ſevere Leſson , that however disgusting Flattery may be to Women of Underſtanding , Sincerity is not the Virtue to retain their Friendſhip -- Be aſsured , however , that whatever I have done to forfeit your friendſhip , was not intentionally done to offend you . I am with gratitude & respect Madam -- Your much obliged & moſt hum : Servt : John Hope 27 th Feby : 1774
