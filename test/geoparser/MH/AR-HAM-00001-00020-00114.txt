Wilton Lodge 8 th . Septr- 1790 . How dare , my Dear Sister , presume to find fault with my Pride ? I hourly commend myself for having called it forth to convince the High & Mighty , that I care not for them . True , my election is not secure . But what then ? I much prefer Trotter down hill , & my Lady 's Walk , to the Mall or S t . James 's Street , & I care not three Sixpences whether ever I take my seat in the hospital of Incurables . My Chinese Sow on the Eve of Pigging , interests me more , than all the intelligence of the Fleets of Spain or France , & the failure of my Carrot crop is a more serious vexation , than the double Return . Politics are vile things . The more I see of them , the more I dislike them . Friendship , Relationship , honour & gratitude must be sacrificed to keep well with a Party , who only court You , because they find it their interest , & who will be just as ready to drop You , as they were alert in taking you up . So says farmer Francis , & You can not contradict him . You may think what You will of my opinions , but would they present Me with a genteel sinecure to enable me to spend a couple of Months now & then in the South , they might make Senators of their Horses if they pleased ; I should not be envious . The prorogation of Parliament will keep us in suspence a long time , as the House will probably not meet for busineſs before Christmas . If they enter into the Merits of our Election , it may poſsibly be a twelvemonth , before the matter is decided . Were they to consult me , I should advise them the to find the Election informal , & order a new one for Sixteen . Many discoveries have been made since the 24 th July , some of them ludicrous enough , but neither party like to talk of what they know , for fear of putting mischief in the heads of their adversaries . As to Lord Hopetoun , he pleases to call himself an Independent Peer . The word wants explanation . Because he voted with Ministry , he expected they would give him all their support , but because he was a Gig , he refused voting for everyone of their friends , countenanced the opposition Candidates , was supported by them , & calls this conduct Independence . The friends of the Minister , refused to vote for Ld . Hopetoun , unleſs on the footing of reciprocity ; he therefore abuses the Minister & toasts His R—l H—s before his father after dinner . As my near Relation & quondam Guardian , his refusing to vote for Me , shocked & mortified Me , but his behaviour has almost determined Me to be callous to every kind of feeling in future . I have not seen him since the Election . We have had a visit from the Pechell 's this Summer . You may believe we were not a little vain in shewing off our place , & on finding they approved of the situation . We likewise expect Lady Warren . She is now at Tynemouth with her unfortunate Child , for the purpose of bathing him , to correct ( if poſsible ) the tendency to deformity . It would do You , Mr. Dickenson & Miſs , a vast deal of good , to explore these Northern Regions . I wish You would all come , that I might have the satisfaction of abusing You face to face . You promised to send me a plan of your House , & like all other Court bred Miſses , you have neglected to send perfo rm your promise . Adieu . Maria joins me in sincere good wishes to You & Yours . Ever my Dear Sister , Your faithful & affectionate Brother Napier . Hawick , Tenth Septr= 1790 Mrs= Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derby by Carlisle Napier .
