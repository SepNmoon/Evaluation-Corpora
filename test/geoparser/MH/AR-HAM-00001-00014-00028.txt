My Dearest I have no News of any sort to entertain you with , no Events interesting or uninteresting to relate but t o w o lines I scrawl to inquire after you & to aſsure you that I have thought frequently of your fall , which I sincerly hope has not been attended with any bad consequences . The Weather except to Chapel has not allowed us to stir out till this Morning , from three o'Clock till ½ pt Seven yesterday I paſsed with Mrs Hagedorn , Mrs Smelt and Genl Freitag & to compleat it , the last hour I had the additional happineſs of Mrs Bludworth s Company , you will not wonder then my Dear at the total anihilation of every bright Idea , if it was to last long I should be unfit for Society . God Bleſs you my Dearest I still have Life enough left to aſsure you of my Sincere Affection -- MC Goldsworthy Queens Lodge Mond a y Morg Love to Mou Mou & c & Affte Duty to dear Prſs Elizabeth Mary & Sophia -- Miſs Hamilton Kew
