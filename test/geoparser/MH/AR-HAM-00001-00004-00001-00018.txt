Dear Miſs Hamilton , Six months have now paſsed without my hearing from you , not that I mean any reproof , tho ' at the same time I must aſsure you that I lost no time in making my acknowledgements for your last very obliging letter . I hope you are now perfectly settled and happy in your new department ; if I understand your disposition , trifling difficulties will not disturb you more than they ought to do ; & where there are none , there is the leſs room for addreſs & ingenuity . Seeing the little ground I have made in consequence of my personal application to my Friends , when I was last in England , I think I may very properly give up all thoughts of further Preferment , which I do with perfect contentedness of mind . I am now paſsed the age in which I might with any prospect of succeſs attempt to create an interest with Men in power , besides I am of myself totally unprovided with the indispensable requisites , the ability of making them any return . And this is an age in which none , but the very credulous indeed , will expect to receive favours gratuitously . See the Men that have risen here for some years past in my Line , & it woud seem , except in very few instances , as if Birth and liberal sentiments were certain disqualifications ; but as I said that my mind was in a contented state , you will not believe me if I proceed in reflexions of this sort . My Agent Mr. Charles Brown died lately at Bath & I have appointed Mr. James Balfour writer to the Signet at Edinburgh to manage my Affairs in Scotland ; I will not fail to give him directions to attend properly to you . I shou 'd be very happy to hear from you oftner , I know you write with the greatest ease such letters as I like best , & that do not show the smallest premeditation . I am going in a few days with my Family to Latour to paſs the summer . I have laid out more money there than I intended , tho ' I hope not altogether injudiciously or to the prejudice of my family . Lady Stormont 's recommendation of me to Ld . Carlisle has operated just in the manner I expected , it has not procured me the smallest notice . I soon perceived she had not the smallest attachment to me & therefore expected that her application to the Ld . Lt . wou 'd correspond with her regard for me ; I shall not be any further troublesome to her , or my Lord , who has been so candid to inform me that he shou 'd be very happy to serve me but that my Line was not in his department . Adieu My Dear Miſs Hamilton continue to believe me as I am with truth Your faithful & Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Sackville Street May 22 d . 1781 .
