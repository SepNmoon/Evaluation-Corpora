My dear Friend , having met Mr Dickenson after I called on you , I told him I could not then go to the opera -- I therefore did not answer the two little notes I found from you when I returned home -- I should have liked vastly to have met you in the Box , but upon findi n g that Ly Cun : could not go , I engagd myself to stay the Eveni n g where I dined which was at Mrs Gally 's in great Ruſsel Street -- to day we have been long engagd to dine at Woronzow s the Russian Minister 's , where we shall perhaps stay late , so that I could not give you this Evening . will you dine with me tomorrow & stay with me till half after seven when I go to Mrs Wilmot s to Musick , & when I will set you down at home ? adieu my dear Friend God bleſs you -- C. M. Gunning -- Sunday 8 th . June To Mrs Dickenson s Honble Miſs Gunning
