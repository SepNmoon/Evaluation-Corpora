London Decr : 2 8 9 th : 1780 My Dearest Miſs Hamilton Why were you so near me yesterday , & not one moment in Stanhope St : I answer for you , that you could not continue to come -- be it as it may -- I must send this Line to ask , whether Miſs Duckworth , may come to yr : Room on Monday -- if there is a chance of seeing the Princesses -- it wd : be a great gratification to her , & I know you are always happy in giving pleasure , whenever you can . -- I suppose I shall only have a glimpse of you , when I come to pay my duty to the Princeſses -- pray tell Pſs : Elizabeth I am quite happy to think I shall see her Royal Highneſs so soon , & I hope pretty Princeſs Sophia has not quite forgot me . I was so sorry I had not any Riddles Jeux d'Esprits & c to send you , but indeed my Dr : I know nothing now but nursing my Julia -- who bears parting with her Nurse , in a manner that wd : touch your heart . Adieu Miſs D begs her kindest Comps : Lord D is still at Bath , & is better for the Waters Yrs : very sincerely PDartrey I must send you some pretty Lines the Dss : of Devonshire repeated to me of Lord Palmerston 's upon a Lock of Hair . 'T is Yours , this Triffle to improve , Its worth depends on You ; a Trifle , if you do not love , A Treasure if you do -- [ Specific source not yet identified ] To Miſs Hamilton Queen 's Lodge London Haller 's Letters to his Daughter
