My dearest Miſs Hamilton , I was this moment coming to you having a very great deal to say to you -- But my Mor will not let me come to you as she says it will be troublesome to you this Evening -- So I can not tell you so soon as I wish 'd de Vive voix how kind & delightful it was in you your most acceptable kindneſs to me last night -- When first I thought of Asking it of you as a Neighbour in my Urgent Neceſsity I thought it a mighty tricky Iſsue -- But by ye time I had cool 'd my heels in yr . Room a Second or 2 -- it then came into my mind yu- wd . think it very Shabby & odd -- such an Application -- & I still cd . wish you had been at home when I sent a note to you whch . wd . have explain 'd it all & was truly in ye form of a Petition -- The true cause ( which I had not time in ye Cold Room to Explain ) was that I cd . not by any means procure ye little Sum in ye House -- S—— was as poor as a Rat -- none of ye Rest of ye Household Could furnish me with sufficient & ( as I tell you all my Secrets ) My dr . Mr- I had so lately applied to in a similar case I did wish to avoid repeating that if I cd by any means -- & at last Rather that I really cd . flatter my self with having a little Friend in a Corner of ye Palace My Coach is now come but I just add a little Plan I had laid which ( as my Mor tells me you have not been quite well today ) must fall to ye Ground -- My Bror . had given me 3 tickets for Lady Derby 's tomorrow who sees masks & My Idea was that you & I shd . have procured a 3 d - -- a decent proper Chaperon -- & to have gone Equipp 'd in Men 's Domino 's -- our Hair dreſs 'd in Ld Lindsey 's Stile -- & -- & here been as lively & amused as poſsible -- & universally admired by all ye finest People there -- It is now out of Sight so I must think no more Abt it -- & in ye greatest haste put an end to this Scrawl of Scrawls from yr Affece Harrit .
