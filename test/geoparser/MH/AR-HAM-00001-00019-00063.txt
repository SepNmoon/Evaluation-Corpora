Gaieties criticized Edinburgh May 9 th - 1774 yours from Chesterfield Street wtout a date My dearest Mary came to hand last post but before I anſwer it I must just hint that I am not a little surprised you take so little notice of my last letter I make no doubt but you are satisfied in your own mind but in this world one ought to satisfy their friends likeways in every thing that can make them uneaſy & I can not think yt you can imagine that Lady Napier & I can be very easy upon your account after what you wrote about Mrs- Rogers so great a friendship & intimacy with a Lady that I must ſay I had all the reason in the world to suppose she loved you as her own daughter & at once to be at ſuch a distance dont hang together , a reason there must be for it , we are not worthy to know the reaſon , or in the hurry of the great City those things may be triffles that a letter any day may set right , as it is of so little consequence what an Old Maid ſays or what friends at a distance may think . you see My dear Girl how good yr Mama has been to you to go so far as Barnet wt you on your road to leave her should make you at all time do every thing to oblige her , few mothers would have been at that trouble in this age so as I think I know you have a good heart , be gratefull for those Bleſsings you receive . It gives me great pleaſure that she has been so well ſince you left her & I hope you will find her so very soon on your return home to her , I am very glad you write every post it will be the only satisfaction she can poſsibly have in your abſence . I am extremely glad you have been with your Uncle Cathcart & that my Young Nieces pleases you , they seem to be good Girls & I hope will turn out worthy amiable women . My two eldest daughters have been both ill of Fevers & sore throats but thank God they are very well & join their Brother in best Compts- to you & I am pleased you like the lines I sent you , but you mistake the author they are not Jane Cathcart s , I send you another from the ſame hand if you find any fault please correct & amend , it will at least oblige me and they are in no other hands that I know off -- Plays , Operas , Pantheon , & Renalagh Good God is not thy little head turned with so much nonsense Play & Operas I will allow may be both amusing , deverting & instructing The Pantheon to see & be ſeen for once or twice may be allowable but Renalagh insipit from the first night will always continue so to people of a ſenſible taste few very few I am ſorry to ſay you 'll meet with in that great City unleſs greatly altered ſince I have been in the beau monde your remarks on the last place pleases me much as they agree exactly with my own opinion which is always flattering when one has a good opinion of the Person who makes them . Most parts of Young Ladies education in this Age are extravagant Muſic & drawing not the least so , and very improperly so , as by that many fine genious 's are left in the lurch that would have been an honour to the Country The Masters are not to blame as they want to make as much as poſsible The rich foolish people has a pride in learning blockheads of Sons & dauthers a smattering of what they have no capacity for to shew their superiority of Riches and ſenſible people must pay extravagantly or lose their accomplishments they are fit for ſuch is my dear Girl the way of the world & when the tide runs strong we must give a little way to it like the Bulrush otherwise like the Oak we will be tore up by the roots , Mary Cathcart deſires me to tell you she will esteem a drawing of yours greatly as she knows you have too much good ſense to continue learning unleſs you see that you profit by it but any thing from you will be acceptable to her -- I have not the pleasure of Louisa Cathcart & Catherine Charlotte Cathcart 's acquaintance but as they are esteemed by Mr Napier I am quite ſure they are deſerving of all you ſay of them I am glad that you have found Lady Napier ſuch as I told you off I know not a better woman or a more amiable one pray remember us in the kindest manner to her if you should see her after you get this , but I suppose you 'll be at home or on the way by the time that this gets to NorthHampton after your Bath jaunt I long to have your remarks of Bath & c As to Lord s scheme for his daughter I shall take the liberty to adopt your good ſense and say nothing of it , as I am not a proper judge of whats fit for anothers daughter especially as I have no buſineſs in the affair -- Well Lady Dawtry at a Masquerade , Curiosity thy name is —— I hope it will be the last as it is the first you shall ever go too & I most ſincerely wish you well at Home & out of all temptations of London I may be abused for this by your Gay friends and called an old illnatured creature but if I can make my dear ward agree with me I care not for what is ſaid otherwise the expence two thouſand pounds & fifty pounds for a ticket its a shame conſidering how many poor miserable creatures it might make happy for their lives & all this , for what , a nights amusement to a parcel of fools that has more money than any thing else but Good God what must senſible People think of them , but no matter its taste , and keeping the best Company , a poor apology for doing a despicable nonſensical thing fit only for children at a dancing School & not for rational minds -- I shall my dear Girl be extremely happy to see a letter dated from Northampton & to find you have returned the fine ſenſible amiable Girl as formerly otherwise I can aſsure you I 'll curse London & all London folks for your sake -- Mrs- Carter joins the young folks in best wishes to you & I am my dearest Mrs Carter most ſincerely Yours Mr- F. Hamilton I expect the Cathcarts en famille in a few days here Did Miſs Hamilton go to the Masquerade ? I dare anſwer No , No , No , two of them might have been construed yes , but three of them is not liable to the ſame construction
