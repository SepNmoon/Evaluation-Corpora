Wilton Lodge 22 d . Janry- 1793 . My Dear Sir , I am very glad to know that Mrs= Dickenson is not dead , tho ' much concerned to hear her health is not such , as those who esteem her as much as I do , would wish it to be . I fear , You do not keep her in proper subjection . If you did , I think , She would hardly dare to be Nervous . I must therefore remind You , of the old adage , ( in spite of Lord Chesterfield ) A Woman a Spaniel & a Walnut Tree , the more they 're beat , the better they 'll be . And as one of your English Judges , known by the name of Judge Thumb , allows of gentle correction , perhaps a little Hazel Castigation might be as effectual a Prescription , as any Dr. Turton may propose , and much more œconomical . My poor Wife , dare not presume to be Nervous , not even when I tell her , that I will have a boiled Pig at Supper , the 13 th . of next April , having then been Nine Years married . One gleam of consolation , however , still seems to comfort her , tho ' She is not permitted to say so , & that is , the poſsibility of my being in London at that time , if the House of Lords agree to allow Me to sit amongst them . I almost wish their Lordships may not , as I would rather lose my Election , than my boiled Pig . The one may be recovered at some future period , but the other never . I am out of all patience with You for selling Taxal . Such a Manoeuvre is directly in opposition to every principle of Liberty & Equality . Pray what right have You to better your Income , when mine grows worse every day ? It is really unpardonable , and I shall hate you for it . I dont doubt , of its having been a Scheme of your Wife 's . It never could have originated with Yourself , because , every sensible Man knows , that Money is the Root of all Evil . I presume , You are a Man of Sense , but as for your Rib , I know her so well , that I shall not hesitate to declare my abhorrence , of all wearers of Blue Stockings . I always adorn my Limbs with white Cotton , manufactured in our own Village . Having now covered two Pages with Nonsense , which I dare not venture to read over , for fear of blushing , it is time to say , that nothing in this world would give Maria & I more real pleasure , than to secure You , Mrs- Dickenson & little Louisa , at our Farm , and we really hope , you will not very long delay giving us that satisfaction . The Mothers , will be full of Vanity , comparing the Accomplishments of their Children , and You and I , may entertain ourselves laughing at them . Maria joins me in very sincere good wishes & I remain ever , My Dear Sir , Yours very faithfully Napier . My Dear Sister , I do forgive You , tho ' like the Witches , your petition is written backwards . My worthy Mate , took it for Greek & was astounded with your Learning , God bleſs You . Be good , get well , & come to Us soon . But remember You are not to teach my Wife any of your naughty tricks . She proposes , submitting to a temporary confinement , next July . Ever Your very Affectionate Brother N—— Hawick Twenty Second Janry- 1793 . John Dickenson Esqr= Taxal Chapel-le Frith Derbyshire by Carlisle Napier
