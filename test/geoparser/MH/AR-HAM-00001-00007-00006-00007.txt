My good Miſs Hamilton Impatient of Confinement I ventured out last night before I had sufficiently recovered my Strength , & have suffered from my Rashneſs . I had a slight return of my Fever , in the night , & I find my Cough increased ; I therefore think it prudent to keep the house a day or two longer . With respect to the unfortunate person I mentioned to you some days ago , we agreed at that time that any pecuniary relief would be but temporary , & no eſsential & lasting service to the family , but I have since received a letter which I now enclose to you , by which you well see that a present pecuniary relief , will be a real service to the poor woman . I have determined to take upon me the fitting out the boy , & shall levy contributions on my friends . A few Guineas or half Guineas therefore I shall now be very thankful for . Another matter which I hinted to you last night , & wished to talk to you upon is this . The Queen when she sent for me upon Mr. Blomberg 's busineſs , ordered me to enquire into the particulars of his conduct at Cambridge , the first opportunity I had of seeing his Tutor , & at the same time to consult him what plan was best for Mr B . to pursue till he could go into orders . Mr. Carr the Tutor is now in London , & I had yesterday a conversation with him on the subject . -- Now I wish to consult with you in what manner I should inform her Majesty that I have executed her orders . Would there be any impropriety in your mentioning to her Majesty that I had seen Mr. Carr ? I know not by what other channel to apply . I do not chuse for many reasons to say a word to John B—— I hope in a day or two to have the pleasure of seeing you in the mean time Permit me to subscribe myself Dear Madam Yours & c , & c JFisher Friday Morn : Will you be good enough to return the first of M rs . B letters , for in it , is her addreſs & I wish to write to her .
