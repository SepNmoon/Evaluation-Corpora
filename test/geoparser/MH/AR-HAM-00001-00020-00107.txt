Edinburgh , 23 rd : March 1789 . My Dear Sister , Your letter of the 22 nd - Decr . 1788 , has never been one day out of my pocket since I received it ; & it has remained unanswered for so long a time , from my wish of having it in my power to tell You , that all my Irish Business was settled . The 15 th . day of last Janry- was appointed for the Hearing of my Cause . The determination has not yet reached Me , tho ' they have extracted £200 from my pocket since the commencement of this Year . I am now fairly tired out , & reproach myself , that I have seemed to be so long negligent , when my inclination has been to send you good News . The happy change in the health of our Excellent King gives universal satisfaction in this Country . During his melancholy illneſs , Party ran very high . The Majority of people were his friends ; & those who were the friends of his Enemies , are now forced to join in profeſsions they by no means relish . I can not agree with You in regretting Ld- Stormont 's situation . I beleive him cold and without sincere friendship . When Interest points out to him the line he ought to pursue , he may fawn , but it will be difficult to point out one single act of disinterestedneſs , which he may have been Guilty of , since the beginning of his political existence . You well know I have no obligations to him , & you may likewise recollect the manner in which I supported him , at the last General Election , contrary to my political wishes , and perhaps contrary to my private interest . I have lately written Circular Letters to the Peers of Scotland , notifying my intention of offering myself to their Patronage & Protection , whenever a General Election may take place . Cathcart answered my Letter with more warmth of friendship , than I could have expected . Ld . Stormont 's answer , was uncivil , not to say impertinent . My family connections in the Peerage were numerous , & the probability was , that my friends in power , were likely to retire from their Offices . I then wished to strengthen any claim I might have , for the Aſsistance of future Ministers , by placeing myself in a situation , which might oblige them to be attentive Me . Whether I shall persist in my desire of being in Parliament ( now that my friends remain in their Ministerial Capacities ) is very doubtfull . Tho ' I may be ( like Yourself ) saucy , yet I know the value of Domestick Comfort & Quiet , & do not wish to be placed in any situation , which may annoy or disturb Me or Mine . I have within these Ten Days walked out to the residence of the Alisons . The weather has been so very cold & bad , that I did not obey your Commands sooner , tho ' I confeſs I have known where they lived , for upwards of two Months . She did not appear , but I delivered your Meſsage to her husband who desired Me to say that All was Peace between You . N.B . This was more than you deserved . Mrs- Alison has lately produced a third Daughter . What brought them to Scotland , or what situation they are in , I have not been able to learn ; but I fear , they are far from knowing what affluence is : I never was very partial to your Mrs- Montagu 's & Mrs- Walsingham 's . Much vanity , much ostentation & pride , was endeavoured to be hid under an appearance of being learned & of protecting indigent Merit . I shall say no more on this subject , for fear of drawing the Tribe of Blue Stockings on my back , & I honestly confeſs myself unable to quote Horace or to Scratch with any of them . To comfort you , my hollow Tooth has been Extracted , but as I have ever been of a perverse disposition , I have not made use of your Allum Recipe . Your poor little Godchild has been at Death 's Door . A fever & inflammation in the Glands of her Throat , had nearly proved fatal . A Dyſsentery has succeeded , but I flatter myself it will not go too far , but may be the means of restoring her to health . She is an enviable Child & was remarkably forward both in walking & speaking . My best wishes & those of Maria ever attend Your Mr. Dickenson & your little one . Sincerely & faithfully your Affect . Brother N—— . P.S . I say nothing about Sisters , I wish mine was Married Mrs- Dickenson Taxall Chapel le Frith Derby
