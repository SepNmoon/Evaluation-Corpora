Oakford Monday morning ½ past 6 13 Sepr . 13 Not having an Oppy of writing when I wish & as I can not write after 8 this morng before Thursday I got at 6 to scribble on -- Recd . Yrs . 4 th yesterday -- I got after turnings & windings as far as Exmouth we went on the Sands & picked up a few Shells the refuse of what had been left but threw most of them away -- there is a Row of houses called the Beacon that are built on the Rock above the Sea that have a commanding prospect of it & the Country , The rest of the Town is built hickledy piggledy -- there is an Aſsembly room & c & houses let as high as 15 Guineas a Week -- We met some promenaders bowing & scraping , ducking & even curtseying to each other some on Donkeys & c a true picture of a Watering place -- there is an Embankment here done by M r . by wch he has taken in a snug Corner from the Sea at present it does not wear the Appearance of profit -- I wished to have croſsed this water to Dawlish wch . is two miles from hence only ¼ Mile by water but finding James P . averse to it I gave it up -- one of his objections was that the last time the horse he then had did not like the motion of a boat & jumped overboard & very nearly took him too -- so that was given up & we took another road by the Œstuary for 2 miles which gave us a good view of Powderham Castle -- In order to avoid Topsham , again we miſsed our way -- & with some difficulty got our Noses set straight forward -- We came by the Artillery Barracks , a mile from Exeter which are on a large Scale & when we arrived at 2 on comparing Notes we found that our hearty Luncheon would not admit of Dinner -- My Companion had dawdled away so much time in changing his dreſs , as we were to go to the Equestrian performances at 7 that we had hardly time to drink Tea -- for the Waiter told us if we were not there by 7 we should not get seats so we drank our Tea a la Washerwoman , nearly scolded our throats & then posted to the elegant Theatre -- constructed of boards & an Awning -- it looked comical & answered the purpose -- We were in good time to choose Seats & paid 3/ for Admittance -- there was part of a military band I believe 5 th Regiment who played very well & the performances were equal to any Thing I ever saw -- the Master Mr. West is the handsomest Man in face & person I think I have seen & an excellent Rider -- We had all sorts of feats -- hoisting one another on their Shoulders 4 or 5 stories high in various ways , tumbling , riding , jumping & tumbling over 4 horses at once -- a dextrous poney & pretty Woman doing such feats on the Slack wire as astonished me -- at one time She had a table placed an the Wire -- on it were two Candlesticks wh- Candles -- a Tea pot & 2 Cups & Saucers -- then swinging with great force , She pretend ed to pour out Tea into the Cups -- then took a Cup Saucer in each hand & moved the Cups about as quick as the Indian moved the Rings round his Toes & did various other feats that were very extra ordinary -- Afterwards a Man amused us with his dexterity on the Slack Rope where he seemed to be perfectly at home -- I have seldom been more amused for 2 hours -- When I came home J. P . said he wished to spend an hour with his friend who we met on the road & at the Theatre so I wished a good Night & sat down to write my letter fm . Exeter & before 12 went to bed but could not sleep . I believe the slack Wire had unstrung my Nerves -- The next morning Nothing occurred before going to the Cathedral except going to the Coffee Room where Sir John Stuart the Hero of Maida came in & asked an Admiral who was sitting by me what News ? Sir J . said he shd . not be surprised if Bonaparte gained some advantages at first & he shd . not despond if he did , for he had the Advantage of Tilsit on his Side , but he expected he would not succeed eventually -- this is great Authority -- Sir J . was at the Theatre -- I had often wished to see this Man -- Who the Admiral was I had no Oppy of making an Enquiry -- The Bishop said he could not ask us to dinner as he was to dine out himself but hoped we shd . stay over Monday -- This we excused ourselves -- he consulted me about putting a Curtain behind the Singers & I said it was what I was going to suggest , he then said come along with me & took me to the Organ Loft & introduced the Organist to me & said that it was my Opinion so & so -- The Organist said it wd . certainly have a good effect but they expected a great Number of people wd . be in the other part of the Cathedral at a lower price & of course they would have reason to be diſsatisfied -- this was unanswerable so we returned to our Seats & then I was convinced by a Chorus that they had powers sufft . to fill the Cathedral & I told the Bp that I had changed my Opinion & thought that it would be best to leave it as it was or the Chorus wd . be too loud to be agreeable -- This Youth who sings so finely & who 's Name is Marsh has a Hair Lip -- his Voice is perfectly clear & harmonious & I think equal to Braham -- He has imitated Catalani & unfortunately mimicked her f all he has got her quivering Chin -- When the Bp . sent for him P . observed he would not sing in Te deum -- & I saw the B . give him some sour look afterwards when he went to present the Book to his Lordship I saw him speak earnestly & good humourdly to Marsh & I gueſsed what was paſsing -- & to be sure he did sing delightfully the whole Anthem was a Solo except the concluding Chorus -- If there had been any regular Conveyance to Exeter I would have gone there to day but there is None but post Chaises & that does not suit my Calculations This little excursion cost me enough , as I would not let James pay , wch . I managed as delicately as poſsible & I gave the Boy 1£ Note thinking it would please the Mother & I believe the little urchin did not tell his Brother -- Before we left Exeter we saw S t . Sidwells Church wch is nearly finished -- it is the prettiest Church I know , built after the Manner of a Cathedral -- The pillars are light & the Ornaments beautifully executed after the ancient Models -- the profit of the music to day is to go towards a steeple . The Body has cost 8000 L -- There is a painted Glass Window at the East End -- representing our Saviour rising in the Clouds -- The Head is fine & some parts besides & some shocking We then went to see M r . Graingers Garden wch . adjoins the Castle as is truly one of the Lions at Exeter -- There is a poplar ( Lombardy ) & a Platanus that exceed any I have ever seen in size & heigtht -- The Garden is unique Depending on a horse we did not leave Exeter till 3 OClock -- we rested our Horses ½ hour at Tiverton & then found the private road dark as in many places it is overshadowed wh- trees -- The Moon was obscured & sometimes I could hardly see the road -- P . had a Tooth ache , his horse not well & tired , so I led the Way -- Mumchance -- We walked down one of the horrible hills near this place & hard work I found it as it is covered with loose Stones -- We got home safe -- eat a good Supper & went to bed -- Please to inform Madam La Comteſse ...... that Dr. Fothergill ( he lives I believe in Exeter St . in the Strand ) has cured 3 persons afflicted wh- the Tic doloreux , one of 8 Years continuance -- The Drs . affect to think it impoſsible , but Rev Henry Jerome De Salis aſsured me it is a fact -- Monday I am either to fish or shoot to day -- Tomorrow we go to shoot at Miſs Mordaunt 's & return on Wednesday -- On Thursday I will write again & then fix a day for my future peregrinations -- Adieu God bleſs you all Amen Single To Mr. Bere 32 Devonshire Place London
