Thursday -- I sent you a hasty short letter on Tuesday . -- in fact there was little for me to say , as nothing had occurred worth relating -- that day Mr. Paynter had appraised Mrs. P . of the Neceſsity of some Arrangement taking place between her & her eldest Son respecting her residence here , as he has refused to grant her a Lease of the house & c -- wants her to depend on his honor & c -- values the premi se at six times as much as she thinks it worth or would give -- therefore it is neceſsary to have this uncertainty made certain & if She is to leave the place it shd . be decided upon without delay -- She therefore seeing it in its proper light , sent her little Maid on the poney to Tiverton with a letter to desire Hayden to come here whilst I staid -- & accordingly he came here last night -- Yesterday we set out early as I promised Mr. Dayvy to give my Opinion about the picture -- D . was gone to Tiverton & had forgot to have it put in the Chancel -- however we got the Clerk to help us & we hoisted it as high as we could & still it has a bad effect -- The Subject is our Saviour bearing his Croſs -- a half length figure -- the head & Limbs coloſsal & the Executioner holding a hammer over his Shoulder with a Countenance expreſsive of malicious pleasure that his Office afforded him & he is dreſsed as a Roman Soldier -- One would not expect such malice in a Roman Soldier -- it might have been more natural for an enthusiastic Jew -- The face of this Man is painted so dark that place it in the best poſsible light it can hardly be distinguished & some people would not see it at all if it were not for the Helmet -- Upon the whole it is a vile picture -- There are some figures about a mile off also leading the two Malefactors sketched in ! ! ! Cosway was christened in this Church on the 5 Nov 1742 -- & the Bishop of Bath & amp ; Wells was born in this parish & was under great Obligations to Mr. Parkin who seems to have been beloved & most deservedly so , by every body -- We should have liked him very much -- he was an uncommonly fine preacher & extremely accomplished & his Widow makes him a perfect Angel -- When I was fishing on Tuesday , a Man at work on a Saw pit said to me , Sir Mr. James does not like fishing or shooting , but he runs famously after a Hare a Coursing & he is an extraordinary good preacher -- There is not a young Man or old in all this Country that is able to preach with him I dare say he will be much liked if his Indolence does not get predominant , as he is always in an extreme at present but extremely well disposed -- The fishing Season is over -- I caught more leaves than fish -- I have had excellent sport & am satisfied -- There were Mr. Bere & two others dined wh- us at Mr. Badcock s -- Our Conversation was principally confined to the good News from Germany -- The Acct . you mentioned in yr- letter of Monday which I had the pleasure to receive before I set out to Bampton , is not confirmed -- but the dispatches are not arrived from Ld . Cathcart -- The Allies are going on very well & it seems very probable that they will succeed -- I expect great News from Ld . Wellington -- he would not sacrifice so much at St. Sebastian without a determination to proceed into France & at this moment it would be of infinite Consequence if he could penetrate as far a s Bourdeeaux with an hostile Army -- Poor Pill Garlic -- I wonder what he is about -- Cs . Greville has seen a great deal of hard Service -- he is a fine young Man & if his Abilities expand wh- his Experience he may be a great Officer in time -- Morr . is gratified by not seeing the name of an Anser killed or wounded -- the black Duck is not a favorite , I suppose she thinks he dives in time to avoid all Danger -- I like Mr. Bere very much -- he is very sensible -- his manners are uncommonly gentle & mild -- he is well bred & agreeable & much beloved -- I am sure you would like him -- We returned at half past 9 -- at first we found it very dark , but the twinkling of a few stars & our Eyes getting by degrees accustomed to the degree of borrowed light we had enabled us to get home very safe -- We found Mr. Hayden Parkin here Mr. J. Paynter seems very weak & is sensible of his precarious Situation -- his family can not be sensible of his great danger or they wdnt let him go about alone & teaze him with busineſs , a time must soon come when they must supply his place -- he is very cheerful -- he was sick & brought up a quantity of Bile yesterday -- I fear that if he reaches much he may break a blood Veſsel again & go off immediately -- which is to be apprehended -- I am sorry the Bird did not arrive eatable -- There were some feathers for Louisa at the bottom of the basket -- James wished me to send the 2 Hares wch . I declined We are going out a Coursing this morning -- I got up at ½ past 6 to scribble to my Love -- I dare say Louisa made a lasting impreſsion on Lady Cis -- wd . be delighted with her -- I rejoice that Mrs. Bigge has been so fortunate -- the last time She was well at first -- I didnt expect she would survive the Busineſs -- I expect to reach Plymouth on Tuesday therefore if you have a letter on the Stocks on Saturday direct it to me at the Post Office Plymouth Dock Perhaps you had better not write to me there again after Monday , as I shall not make a long Stay at Plymouth I only wish to be acquainted with the place & a few days will satisfy me & to be alone at an Inn -- Wednesday & Friday are the days for seeing Mount Edgcumbe -- I shall proceed to Clifton after satisfying my Curiosity at Plymouth & stay there two days & then direct my face homewards with great pleasure to embrace those who are dearest to my Heart -- Adieu -- I must now prepare to adonize my person for the morning -- I feel half inclined to write to Mrs. de Salles before I leave this place as you would like me to do so -- Say pretty things for me to those I like -- dear Mrs Savile will be wh- you this evening at Drury Lane -- I have a great Affection for her -- I shall think of you & see you in my Minds Eye & I hope you will laugh heartily -- 8 OClock Good morning to You -- Single To Mrs. Dickenson 32 Devonshire Place London
