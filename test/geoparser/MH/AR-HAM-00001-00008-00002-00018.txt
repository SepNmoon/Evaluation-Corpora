2 3 0 th . Decbr . 1799 a thousand thanks my dear for your kind and entertaining note , I am glad to hear you are all so well , and have been so merry . I return you the delectable manuscript . poor dears , I daresay you made them all very truly happy , I have ever had my fears that those poor dear W : girls were ill fated mortals . the only chance and salvation for them is the eldest girl marrying well into some respectable connexion of her own religion . I foresaw they would get into the vortex of the great world the moment they got to Town . unhappily without a proper introduction into it . but I was asked by several the short time I was in Town to introduce them to Miſs W- & whom they heard they said , sung so delightfully , and Lady Clarges , with many others such , were running mad after Mrs. Fn : and her . they are so young and so unknowing that one pity 's rather than blames their misdoings . Harry P . is much flattered by your kind invitations , he begs much to see you , and is at all events determined to make another attempt before he leaves us , he says he will if he poſsibly can breakfast with you at your house on Wednesday . but he begs if he is not with you to the fraction of a moment , that you will not wait for him . for it is more than he will undertake to answer for , the being able to get up in time to be with you at that hour but he will exert himself to the utmost , and that is all he can promise . the lady P . is bent upon picking up a visit in a certain quarter . I am convinced of that . and by Hook or Crook she 'll do it . I am grievously disapointed to day , I sent chaise and the Postillion on horseback to attend Mr. de S : from Hoccliffe home . I prepared the fatted Calf for his reception , and just as dinner time arrived John returns with a small parcel which was left at Hoccliffe last night by the liverpool mail with particular directions to have it sent over to me immediatly by a special Meſsenger , instead of which they kept it till four o'clock before they gave it to John who had been waiting there all the morning . the moment he got it , he rode home , and was to ride back again with orders for the chaise , the parcel contained a note to say that he had so bad a cold , that Dr Pearson was displeased at finding him out of bed , nor no leſs would he suffer him to go out . I can not describe to you how this has vexed and disapointed me . tho ' I had a fatal foreboding that something would disapoint me ; but I will not go on now the croaking humour is begun . love and Compts . to both . Affecly ever Yrs . & c JH . de Salis thurdy morning My dear Friend .
