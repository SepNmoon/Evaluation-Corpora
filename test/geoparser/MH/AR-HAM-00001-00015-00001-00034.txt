St Jamess 26 th Jany 1789 My dear Friend ! I have been very ill since I received your letter , not dangeri n g or painfully so , & not not of my Horton Rheumatism so that you see it is of no consequence , particularly as I am now quite well -- it was only a violent Cold & fever with a pain in all my Limbs , which kept me three days in bed -- this fine weather has quite recovered me & I am again taking my Bark which was suspend ed for a week , constantly every day -- thank you my dear Friend for l your letter , & for having openly told me that I had vexed you , I had feared having done so , by something I said that day on the subject of correspondence yet did not feel conscious of self reproach , or of havi n g merited yours , of seei n g you averse to an explanation I forbore to preſs you , for one -- I am now 28 years old , ten years older than when I first knew you , have been in the world for near 12 years , & have had more experie nces of various kinds than most people of my age -- much vexation , many diſsappointments , of then in reasonable plans & hopes of happineſs , & many , of those which it was not unnatural for a warm imagination & a cœur sensible to form , in the days of enthusiasm ! I am blasée d upon most subjects , I have learnt to apreciate things at their just value & price & the days of romance are over ! But tho ' I am not so easily deceived by the appearance of virtue , by the profeſsions of Friendship I am far from bei n g a sceptic in either -- I could not if I were inclined , without blindneſs & the height of ingratitude when I am bleſsed with so many Friends , whose virtues excite my admiration & respect whilst their kindneſs & long attachme nt to me constitute my happineſs -- And I believe I myself am not a worse Friend for being a reasonable one -- I am very glad to hear such a good account of little Louisa 's Health , I never could have a doubt of her succeſses I hope she will not feel her power , & be allowed to use it before she , has principles & reason to teach her the proper objects on which to exert it , & the discretion & moderation that ought always to attend on power -- it is dangerous in the hands of a clever child -- to herself & the habit of governing , is a most fatal one , in a woman -- this I particularly addreſs to Mr Dickenson who I hope has not forgot all the useful admonitions & instructions given him on this Subject at Horton & thumbs away with proper Spirit -- My Father and Bell are quite well I can not say so much of my Brother who looks like Death & is in a low , uncomfortable way , I do not know what to make of his Complaint , but tho ' I trust it is attended with no alarmi n g symptoms of danger nor will & that it threatens no consequences of danger , I am far from easy upon his account , the leſs so from not knowi n g what to wish about him , or whether he would be better for country air , or a moderate degree of diſsipation here -- I hope to talk to you on this subject in a more chearful & comfortable style when I write next -- we have led the a life of the most perfect quietn eſs & retirement since we came -- indeed a whole week I was in this room -- one night I went to an aſsembly at the Dſs of Gordon s of which the noise , crowd & heat stupified & overcame me , & I hardly recovered the effects of it the next day , tho ' I was at home before twelve -- what does not habit reconcile one to , or at least enable one to bear ! my reason & inclination can never again make their peace or agree wth the absurdity & stupidity of a great crowd , but in three Months I shall have heard no noise , felt no heat & shall come home without feeling the least tired -- I have not yet seen Mr Digby , he is now & then in To u n for a few hours , but he is principally at Kew wh ere his duty , & wish to be of service confine h im -- he has been sometime in Somersetshire wth his Family -- I believe the King is much better , I have the greatest hopes of his recovery , but the found ation vain of these hopes is open to you in Dr Willis 's evidence in the report of the Committee on the Ex : of the Physicians -- I have reason to think highly of Dr Willis 's good sense skill & what is of the most consequence of his heart character & good intentions which are sincere as his endeavours to promote the King 's recovery & unmixed with political or worldly motives , on hi m I pin my Faith & shall thank God when he is allowed ( by the removal of the other Physicians ) to have fair play & the sole , uninterrupted , unopposed management of the King -- As to party , the rage of it runs so high , to that extreme of violence as is inconceivable , it disunites families diſsolves Friendships , banishes even good manners & common civility , & requires the sacrifice of reason & common Sense ! God help us -- what sad times & what a dreary black prospect ! adieu my dear Friend ! God bleſs you -- you are in luck to be out of this tourbillon -- remember us to Mr D . & let me hear from you soon -- if I hear anythi n g that can interest you , depend on my letti n g you kno w God bleſs you once more your sincere & affec : C.M.G . Bell never comes here now or very late so that I have time to read & c -- I am very much engaged wth my table which grows extremely pretty -- To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
