My dear Friend I am obliged to diſsappoint you and myself this Evening for I find it impoſsible to manage to come to you even for the short time I hoped -- as I depend on my Father who goes both to Mrs Lyell s & Daddy 's where Bell wishes me to go on account of the Ball on Wednesday if you are not engaged on Tuesday I will spend it with you comfortably -- adieu Sunday
