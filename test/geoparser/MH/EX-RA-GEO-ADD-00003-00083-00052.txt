I have told you repeatedly that I never would accept presents of any kind from you -- therefore I have a right to be affronted that you contrived the Q—— should command me to accept the one you gave me the other Night tho ' it was but a trifle -- My proud heart will not submit to these sort of things therefore you put me to an expence rather inconvenient to my finances as I will never accept any thing from you without returning something of equal value -- Therefore a truce . I am no vile mercenary servile Friend , I want nothing from you but truth & sincerity & that you should in every action prove yourself worthy of the distinguished situation Providence has thought fit to place you in Adieu I am truly your Friend & Sister
