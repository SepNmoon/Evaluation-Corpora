Recd . Monday afternoon 5 oClock -- 22 d Novbr- 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , my Friend , What a dear whimsical creature thou art , however I have a crow to pull with you , , who in ye . names of Euterpe & Melpomene ever desired me you to appear to y m e , in a disposition in wh .. you really was not , pardon me my dearest Sister is yt . quite consistant with true friendship , did not I tell you you was equally dear & amiable in my eyes in whatever mood you was , you will again say I have been giving some odd twist to yr . meaning . Now I have spit my fire : How cld .. you twist my meaning so as to suppose I recommended to you to follow all ye . cries & follies of ye . age , what I meant by diſsipation , was going more into ye . World among yr . friends & acquaintances , than is in yr . power to do here , & by that means to diſsipate yr . melancholy & to resume yr . usual air de badinage As you desire so much to have ye . Book I will send it to you I have two sets of it , therefore you need not hurry yrself to return it , however I shall not go on with it till you have returned it , after having marked every beautiful paſsage . You will observe I have not advanced above ye . 1 st . . hundred Pages in it , & have marked here & there a paſsage wh .. hit my fancy , when I spoke so highly of ye . Book , it was merely a character I heard of it from ye . person who originally lent ym—— it to me , however ye . Set you shall have is my own , therefore mark it wherever there is a pretty paſsage , & give me fairly yr . opinion of it , it is called ye . Memoirs of Miſs Sidney Biddulph , & is generally believed to be written by ye . Old Mr .. or Mrs .. Sheridan , I can not tell wh .. for I know they both have written . Good night My Miranda pleaſant dreams , & happy slumbers be yr . lot . my Cold is something better to night thank God , I will let you know how it is tomorrow after my ride . Monday Morning . I have been out riding this Morning & find myſelf ye . better for it . My Cold I hope is going off for it has lodged itself in my head , & makes me sneeze , & my eyes & nose run to a most amazing degree , always suppose my Miranda yt . I never cld .. look upon it as perfect confidence unless I was to be perfectly minutious about myſelf . I am of opinion yt . what you intend to do with regard to yt . little Burr is perfectly right , & yt ye . sooner you put yr . plan in execution ye . better . I admire ye . idea of ye . Bobwig & think it wld .. become him amazingly . God bleſs you & preserve you , & may we long long long enjoy our mutual friendship prays Yr . Yr . Yr . Palemon toujours de même P.S . Pray tell my # # about ye days in Town . A . A . A . toujours chére
