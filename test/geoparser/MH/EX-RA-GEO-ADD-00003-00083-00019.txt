6 Novbr . I pretend not my frd . to inquire why you are so anxious to inquire be informed into the nature of my friendship with Lord Napier , but I will tell you as far as relates to myself -- I never had any other idea but that of esteem & friendship -- I never shall enter into any other engagement with him -- I think he loves me as his best friend & Sister -- I tell you my friend that I think a person of true refinement will never enter into ye- sacred union if they do not feel they do or can love that person beyond every earthly being -- upon this principle I have ever acted & if my nature changes not -- ever shall . We must take things as we find them & act up as well as we can to our respective situations in life “ Act well your part , there all the honor lies ” Alexander Pope , An Essay on Man . In Epistles to a Friend . Epistle IV . My heart is open to yr . inspection -- The errors of my judgement you will find it an honest one -- The errors of my judgement must never be imputed to its dictates -- You need not ask me to tell you what I hear said of you my friendship will never suffer me to be silent -- so you may depend upon hearing -- good -- bad -- or indifferent , wth . my comments of course -- Adieu
