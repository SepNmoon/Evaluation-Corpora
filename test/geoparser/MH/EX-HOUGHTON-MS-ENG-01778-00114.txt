Bristol 23 d . July 1782 I have a notion , my dear Madam , that our last letters paſsed each other on the road . Had they the feelings of their Writers they woud have felt no small regret at being so near each other , without any intercourse ; at least I will answer for one of them , and it would be unkind to entertain suspicions , leſs generous of the other , because , as the Philosophers say , it would not be reasoning by Analogy . And I do receive so many agreeable proofs of your friendship and attachment when I am within reach of you , that I can never suspect you of indifference when I am not . Miſs Sharpe has been here lately : She was in great spirits , and gay quite to affectation , but as we could not enter into those Subjects that were most present to each of our thoughts , our conversation was awkward and constrained . She never enquired after our friend , tho ' she knew I had lately seen her , nor did I ask after her lover . She has been spending a fortnight at Stourhead , before she came to the Bristol Wells ; and is now gone back to the Lodge . Her friend Mrs. O ' K—— told me she was to be married in about a fortnight , and that I believe is ten days ago , so I imagine the great event must be near taking place . Mrs. O ' K set off from hence to Ireland for six weeks . When you write to our dear friend at Deal , probably these things may be new to her , as she writes me word , she is out of the way of hearing any thing of these matters , except by accident , and you I believe are in the habit of writing to her frequently . I return your domestic history , or daily Memoirs with many thanks for your understanding me so thoroughly as to know I shou 'd like to have it . Tis well that you Courtiers have power , and dignity and reputation to atone for the meritorious sacrifices you must make of liberty and leisure . “ Tis meet the great shou 'd have the fame of Happineſs , “ The consolation of a little Envy . ” Edward Young , Brothers -- This last indeed is , I believe , a consolation you are seldom without ; but you , I have a notion do not derive your first delights from this consideration as you are , if I dont greatly mistake you , of a cast of mind which gives you most pleasure a faire des heureux , than des Envieus . Finding the Aphorism of Solomon , that th ere is nothing new under the Sun Ecclesiastes 1:9 . , as true in literary as in worldly things , I am got ba ck to Terence 's Comedies , and to Elizabeth Carter 's Sermons Rather heterogeneous matter to be mixed up together you may think . But Terence was always a favorite Author of mine ; as I thi nk he is a rare instance of a Poet without a redundant word ; and whose exact delineation of character and manners , well reward you for the fewneſs of his incidents and the same of his plots . And of the venerable Arch Bp . I heard a learned Man say , that some Sermons could keep him good till Monday , some till tuesday , but that Lady Charlotte Finch kept him good the whole week . Your telling me that our excellent Prince Alfred was going to Secker increased and revived my regret that I could not accept the kind invitation of the latter to spend part of the summer with her . With what pleasure could I listen to the voice of Wisdom personified in her , for a whole Summers day . I begin to suspect there is a combination among the booksellers that I sha n't get Secker . Is it not provoking ? I am waiting with anxiety for a confirmation of the very agreeable report , that my valuable friend Mrs. Delany is to have the See of Salisbury . If he does , never was preferment better bestowed . -- If he does not , he is a Philosopher and a Christian , and of course can not never want the best consolations under any disappointment . Adieu my dear friend Yours most faithfully Mrs. Boscawen And what if Madame Genlis wont be our Minister “ I trust we have within the realm “ Five hundred as good as he . ” If by good the Author means moral , I think w e need not doubt it .
