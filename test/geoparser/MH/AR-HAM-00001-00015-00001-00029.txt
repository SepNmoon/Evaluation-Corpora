My dear Friend ! So you never have been in Town and I shall leave it without seeing you -- Ly Binning was obliged to go to Bath & could not receive me , so I there miſsed the opportunity I should have had of paying you a visit -- I have done nothing I liked & have been diſsappointed in all my little plans or hopes of enjoymen t Mrs Stuart whom after above two months absence & bad Health at Bath , I should have been extremely desirous of seeing , does not return till Saturday the day after I go -- I have been kept here till I am perfectly stupid & enervated & have hardly strength & spirits left to carry me away . I have survived all my Friends & most of my acquaintance , & I am tired of seeing the pale faces of those who remain -- I ought not to give myself airs for I am as pale as any of them tho ' it is not with raking for I have been in bed before 12 for these three weeks past , but literally with ennui & disgust -- it is with the sincerest pleasure & with more alacrity than I though t myself capable of , that I arranged & packed up my books & c -- for Horton , where I am now goi n g for 5 Weeks exclusive of my leave which I shall equally have in November & December -- the King 's journey has been , or rather will be , of great service to me , for it sets me at liberty till the next Drawingroom the 14 th of August -- I sincerely hope it will be as beneficial to him in his health , & as agreea ble as an excursion -- My dear Friend let me hear from you , & about you , Mr D—— and your dear little Louisa whom I hope Richmond air agrees perfectly with -- tell me your plans , & whether there is any chance of your coming into Northamtonshire before the 14 th of August , I should be glad of any certainty of seeing you , but I think you will be able to stay longer with us if you come in November -- Co me you must I am determined upon it & you shall no longer be let off -- I shall write to you when I am settled at Horton to tell you how happy & well I am , & how much better it will be for you if you will come to be happy with us & to make us so -- adieu , God bleſs you my dear Friend , may you always be as happy & well as I wish you -- God bleſs you -- adieu -- Wednesday night July 9 th remember me very kindly to Mr Dickenson -- Honble .
