Hampton Whitsunday Night 8 June My dear Miſs Hamilton We are exceſsively disappointed I wrote to you a fortnight ago to fix for your Coming here to day ; I wrote again to you three days ago to say that Mrs. Garrick wou 'd go to Town to fetch you this Morning . She accordingly went on purpose , and to our great mortification did not find You . Yr . Servant said you were gone into the Country but might poſsibly be at home to Night . Mrs. Garrick has therefore sent back her Chariot to bring you in case You are returned . If you are , you will order what time he shall come for you to morrow morning to bring you here ; but if he does not find you to night he has orders to return home in the Morning , and in that case we must give up the pleasure of meeting this time , as we ourselves leave this place on tuesday morning , when we proposed to have carried you home . Adieu ! it is very unlucky -- I am grieved not to see you . But perhaps you are come . Yrs . e v er H More To Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street Picadilly
