71 , Queen Street 10 th . March 1807 My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 29 th - Janry has not been forgotten , though it has not been replied to . The delay in answering it , has been occasioned by the hope of being able to tell You whether Ministerial punishment was to be inflicted on my Pocket , as well as on my Vanity . It seems , however , that I am not to be let into that Secret , as Lord Spencer has not yet taken any Notice of the Letter , I wrote to him , desiring to know if h I was again to be honoured with His Majesty 's Commands , as Commiſsioner to the General Aſsembly , next May . I sent off this Letter , on the 9 th - Febry- , a few days after your s L reached me . Several Lords are talked of f , as likely to get that Appointment , viz . The Earls of Errol , Leven , Selkirk , & Lord Semphill . That Lord Leven has applied for it , I know ; because , he has both conversed & corresponded with me on the Subject . Enquiries have , likewise , been made , as to the Manner , in which , my State Liveries are shaped , But , I have not been able to discover , whether this Curiosity proceeded from the Anxiety of the Taylor , who applied to see them , or from the direction of a Superior . Thus far I have lear n't , that the Taylor who called on my Clothier , was Foreman to the person employed by Lord Errol . This , however , proves nothing . The Report circulated was , that I did not intend to ask to be re-appointed , presuming that I was offended at the manner , in which I had been driven from Parliament . That I was so , is true . But , it would have been Childish in me to revenge their ill treatment on myself , by voluntarily relinquishing £1000 pr Ann . If I am to lose it , Ministers shall have the full Credit of taking it from Me . The Chequered Votes , are explained thus . I have , at a General Election , Sixteen Votes to give . There are , perhaps , thirty Candidates . My political Inclinations lean to a particular Party , while , at the same time , from private friendship I wish to vote for one or two Individuals of the Opposite Party . I do so . This disposes of one or two of my Votes , the other fourteen , or fifteen , I give to Candidates of my own party . Other Peers act in the same way , and this puts it out of the poſsibility of knowing how a General Election may turn out , till the Votes are actually given . Five Votes more than I had , would have secured my Election , and had not the Earls of Elgin , Stair , & Roseberry , the Lords Forbes , Somerville & Rollo deserted me , I should have carried my Election in spite of all the Opposition of the present Ministers . Perhaps , You may have seen my Son William 's name in the Gazette , having aſsisted at the demolition of a Fort , on the Coast of his France . He is now on board the Imperieuse with Lord Cochrane . They have lately returned from their Cruize to Plymouth , where the Ship is to be docked . I can not condole with You , on the death of Mrs- Hamilton , The Cathcarts have put on their Sables , but , have not mentioned the Event to me , & have been equally silent on the Subject . They go on very well with Us , and we mutually exchange Dinners . I do not , however , allow any Letters for me , to be sent under cover to him , nor have I ever asked him for a Frank . He has a numerous Correspondence , & the number of Franks are limited . None , but one who has been in Parliament , can conceive the Annoyance of being tormented with Letters inclosed to them . It was a constant source of trouble to myself , and Servants , besides having very frequently the pleasure of paying for these Packages , on account of their being overweight . The Lay of the Last Minstrel must please Me , “ Ready , ay Ready ” , for the Field . Walter Scott ( 1805 ) The Lay of the Last Minstrel , Canto IV , stanza VIII . As to your Goſsips , I am the worst hand in the World for . I believe , there are three Cathcart Girls , none of them handsome , & four Boys . As to the Greville Mansfields , I know nothing of their Stock , & I make it a Rule , to ask no Questions . A deputy Grand Daughter of Counteſs Greville Mansfield , Miſs Finch Hatton , is going to be married to a Brother of Lord Hopetoun 's , General Charles Hope , a Son of my Uncle Hopetoun 's by his third Wife . Louisa is perfectly right , in taking Exercise , As I neither ride , nor keep riding Horses , my Miſses are obliged to tramp on foot , none of them seeming to have any particular relish for going an Airing in the Carriage , for which I do keep Horses , though they are hardly ever used . I hear your old friend Mrs- Douglas , alias Mrs- Beauvoir , alias Miſs Sharp is defunct . You will no more come to Edinburgh , than I shall go to Japan . Adieu . My Wife joins me in everything kind to You , Mr. D . & Louisa . My best wishes to my Countrywoman . Ever my Dear Sister , Your faithful friend & affectionate Brother Napier Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds
