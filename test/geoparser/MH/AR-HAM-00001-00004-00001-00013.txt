Dear Miſs Hamilton , You really do me no more than justice in supposing that you had gain 'd ground upon my affection ; I now aſsure you that your very kind behavior and unreserved confidence have completely rivetted my regard and love for you . I was always above the idea of leaning upon your interest whatever it may be , nor will you ever receive from me the smallest hint that I can have any views from that quarter . I love you for your noble sentiments alone , and for your heart that poſseſses so much sensibility and so thorough a contempt for all sordid considerations ; if my own will not bear this test , I am not a friend for your purpose , however I am proud enough to say it will . I am very sorry for the indisposition of your excellent friend Lady Charlotte Finch , and Miſs Goldsworthy ; your undergoing so much fatigue on their accounts , will no doubt , be esteem 'd by them as the best return you can make for their affection for you ; and you will at the same time be laying up a a further stock of merit where I really believe it will be properly estimated . If your constitution does not suffer , I shall not pity you for these fatigues ; independency obtained by your your own labor and merit will be vastly more satisfactory than a philosophical contentment in too contracted a situation , in which it wou 'd be neceſsary for you to check that sensibility from which you feel so much pleasure . You have already surmounted many difficulties , you are surrounded by respectable Friends of your own acquiring , they are convinced of the goodneſs of your mind , it will be an additional satisfaction to them to perceive that it is not an inactive one and such as will easily lose sight of prospects pointed out by an honorable ambition . It is a true tho ' a trite observation , that every one is the architect of his own fortune ; your plan is good and your foundations judiciously laid we insist upon your not disappointing us in the superstructure ; but I quit this stile of authority , you have given me good advice , I have now repaid you with the best in my power and unask 'd ; this is the privilege of a friend , you no sooner call me so , than I avail myself of that privilege . Captain Cathcart has been with us in Dublin near three weeks , he is raising men for a new Regiment , of which he is to be Major ; eighty men are his proportion which will cost a considerable sum , he has been already tolerably succeſsful . Lord Stormont supplies the means , his friend Mr. Fullerton is to be the Col . Commandant . Captain Cathcart is a very sensible unaffected young man with fine dispositions -- we make no comparisons , I was equally disposed to be sensible of the merit of other Persons , but they gave me no opportunities . I forgot to mention in my last , that I spoke to Robt . Greville to beg that he wou 'd introduce Lord Warwick to you , he told me that Ld . W.k had expreſs 'd a great desire of being acquainted with you , I am sure you will like him . Mrs. Hamilton begs to be affectionately remember 'd to you I am Dear Miſs Hamilton , Your faithful & Affection-te Uncle Frederick Hamilton Sackville Street March 14 th . 1780 . till the 20 th May next when I return to Latour .
