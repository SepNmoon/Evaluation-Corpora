Dear Miſs Hamilton I have inadvertently deferr 'd thanking you for your last letter much longer than I ought to have done ; but shall not offer any further apology , as it might have the appearance of treating you with too much formality . I am happy to find that you have borne your late loſs with such proper resignation ; your dutiful affection to your Parent was too evident to leave any doubt of the distreſs you must have felt in being deprived of her . It must have been a very great satisfaction to you at that crisis , to find that your conduct had created you so many Friends , which without flattery I may say , that I am sure you will know how to retain . The Papers you mention can be of no use to you or to me , so that you may destroy them if they are an incumbrance . I have already recommended it to Mr. Fetherston to remit to you as soon as poſsible half a years Jointure due to Mrs. Hamilton the 1 st . of November last , tho ' I fear it will not come as soon as you may expect , for the poverty and distreſs of this Country is not to be conceiv 'd & Rents can not be got in as formerly ; if Ireland does not get some relief soon as its trade and manufactures are totally at a stand all ranks of people must suffer in proportion in the general calamity ; you will also receive an Arrear of Jointure money from Scotland in which I hope Mr. Brown will be punctual tho ' I have also receiv 'd from him great complaints of the scarcity of money in that Quarter . Mr. Fetherston mention 'd to me that he had receiv 'd no acknowledgement for his last remittance ; but said he wou 'd write to you himself . If you shou 'd think at any time that my advice cou 'd be of service to you in your Affairs you may command it and be aſsured that it will be given with perfect sincerity . I have pass 'd the Winter here in great solitude not by choice for after my great expences upon this Place I cou 'd not afford to keep two Houses . Mrs. Hamilton is well & desires to be affectionately rememberd to you ; my two Children are also in perfect health and are indeed in every respect as promising as I cou 'd wish . My Daughter Jane so call 'd after Lady Cathcart is between 10 & 11 years old is very handsome & has uncommon abilities . My Son is between 7 & 8 & as he is now thoroughly recover 'd . I intend to put him to a very go od school in the spring -- Adieu Dr . Miſs Hamilton believe me ever Your faithful & Affect . Uncle Frederick Hamilton Latour , near Dublin Feby 16 th . 1779 .
