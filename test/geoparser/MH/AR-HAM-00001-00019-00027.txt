Canterbury Jany- 8 th - 1773 X Card playing Last night my dearest Mary only brought me yours of the 31 st of Decr last year & of the first of this , otherwise you may be perswaded that I should not have been so long in anſwering it especially when I conſider that I may be thought ungrateful ( in not anſwering so long & kind a letter as yours was ) by others was I to use them so but hope my dear Girl now knows me better & believes I have no greater pleasure than in writing to her excepting that of recieving hers , which must always give me more -- you deſire to know if Mrs- Napier mentions having got yours , I thought I had anſwered that before as I am ſure I deſigned , but have forgot I suppose , she did not mention any letters she had got from you these ſome months past . but that is no reason that she has not as her letters lately has been filled up entirely wt buſineſs & that mostly law so that she has not had room or time for any thing else -- why should you ſay “ now I y ou have reinstated me in your good opinion ” when was you out of it ? for upon my word I do n't know , but am ſure never ſince I knew you she so my dear Girl you must have dreamt it & as it was a dream you have too much good ſen c ſ e to mind it ; It was your Uncle Cathcart I meant you to write too I knew you wrote Lady Hamilton regularly and for Mr F.H . I left that entirely to yourself as I knew you wd do what was right there Col Bland is very obliging by e i nquiring after me , please my Compts- & tell him I was not very Croſs . If Money can give happiness Mr Egerton will have enough wt the Lady that has five Hundred thouſand Pounds for her fortune but good sense , amiable disposition , good nature & an agreeable Companion may be wanting , which in my opinion can not be made up by having millions , however as I know nothing of the Lady , she may have & be poſseſsed of every requisite neceſsary ( if the two last words may be made use off together ) to render the marriage state happy -- I can aſsure you My dearest Mary a chit chat letter now & then unbends the mind , its like reading a Novel at night , after having been studying hard all day & one returns with double pleaſure the next day to the more senſible occupation , but I dont approve at all of the Complimentary part of yours to me especially when it takes the least merit from a Lady that I love & regard so much for her good ſence & a ble amiable behaviour at all times perhaps you may not recollect what you ſaid , so to refresh your memory I shall sett it down here but to bring it properly in you ſay that you agree wt me that its the best way between friends to write wtout studying then you go on . “ not that I am poſseſsed of “ so much vanity as to imagine I expreſs “ myself properly & therefore have no occasion “ for much thought -- to be Miſstriſs “ of that , I should borrow the ingenious , “ eaſy , & agreeable Pen of my Dear Guardian “ but as its not in my power to write “ like him I must content my self with “ expreſsing my obligations in the best manner “ I am able for his condescenſion in bearing “ with it , & also for his great goodneſs in telling “ me , the recieving my letters gives him “ pleasure ” Does my dear Girl think that I can poſsible allow of the above wtout letting her know that these kind of Compliments can never be agreeable where they take from a friend , even tho from that very friend , to one that profeſses a friendship so very sincere as that I do for you tho I must own you palliate it over wt a very flattering expreſsion viz . yr dear Guardian & he hopes his Dear ward will for the future write him without putting him any more to the blush unleſs she means to have a Compt- in return which I can aſsure you the above gave me the finest oppertunity in the world of doing , did I ever deal in that commodity but to return to yours -- I would have excuſed no other person but Mrs Hamilton in preventing you writing to me but as I am ſure she had a good enough reaſon I say no more -- Your Reflections My dearest Mary on the ending & beginning of the year are like Yourself and extremely proper for every body old & young to mind & put into practise , tho I trust to God almighty that there is no everlasting eternity of Miſery , that a punishment will be afflicted according to our bad deeds I make no doubt off but I hope not ſuch a one , as to banish for ever one the preſence of God for ever , Its true he gave us a free will , but in my poor opinion , its inconsistant with the goodneſs of God to suppose he created a perſon to be doomed to everlasting misery but let me drop a subject that I am not capable of deciding properly on , for fear of drawing myself into a scrape that I never deſigned , but allow me to wish and hope that all mankind may live up to the rules laid down by our Mother so as to inherit eternal bliſs -- Indeed my Dear Mary I meant nothing more by marking the agreable & amiable Mr Price than that I had obſerved you marked ye agreeable widow & her elegant Suppers however I am extremely happy it produced so flattering a promise as that I shall be the second perſon in the world that shall be conſulted when my dear Girl proposes to alter her situation in life , but I can aſsure you that I 'll be very dificult to please as I know few or none that I think deſerves you , so my dear Girl write always your sentiments without restraint to me and whatever confidence you put in me believe me it shall always be confined to my own breast -- I must agree with you in your opinion of Cards but as we are not all born to do just as we please & as Cards now is the only buſineſs , ( I had near said education ) of the better sort of this Kingdom it is a duty to learn them that we may be ſome times uſefull to those who can not take any more rational amuſement and I would have my dear Mary not only capable to amuse the senſible but those likeways of a meaner capacity whose number I am afraid is the greatest in ye world and its a happineſs to be well with all , as the tongues of fools are shorter than those of wise people as they run faster for the most part & when one ſeems to dispise or dislike what they are fond off , they most com̅only they revenge themſelves by lyes , so upon the whole tho I entirely agree wt you that it is not a very proper amuſement for the fair Sex yet a little of it may oblige others , which is always proper to do in both Sexes & the knowledge of Card playing is eaſily carried about after it is attainted which is not so eaſily done by people that has an antipathy to Cards however my dear Girl do not think me an advocate for your learning I only write what occurs , but not by way of advising any thing , as if you can keep from them wtout offending such a number of Bablonians I think and am ſure you both can and do employ your time to much more advantage & much more becoming a young Lady yt that thinks & knows that time is too short for those things absolutely neceſsary as to our duties towards God , or Neighbours and ourselves Duty 's that ought to be prefered to every sort of div erſion whatsoever but which are com̅only dispised becauſe they are ordered to be done by our Mother and the Laws of that Country we live hi n Adieu My dearest Girl accept to yourself and please in the best manner you can aſsure Mrs- Hamilton of my best wishes and of Compts- of the Seaſon & believe to be My dearest Mary yours most Affctly- To Miſs Hamilton .
