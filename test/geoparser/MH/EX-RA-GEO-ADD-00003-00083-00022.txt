10 th Novbr . 1779 -- I thank you my friend for Your last kind note affectionate & affecting Note I will promise & endeavour I again promise to endeavour to diſsipate the gloom melancholy turn you so constantly complain of in me , but you must allow that the return of the season will forcibly bring to mind the aw e ful solemn scene I was witneſs to last year -- a Thousand circumstances You can not enter into , & wch . I can not communicate , makes me shed many tears bitter tears upon my pillow -- Yet , ( & Almighty God I thank thee for it ) I am enabled to derive comfort from ye- reflection , that from my earliest days I never deviated from the strictest ties of duty either in word or deed -- You have never lost lost a friend -- besides my Parents , I have lost five persons -- & that within a a short space of time & at an early period of my life that I was attached to , either from gratitude for their partial affection for me , or from my love of them -- ye . oldest of these not more than 40 years -- Some time my frd . is required to deaden the impreſsion of grief -- I trust the weakneſs of my nature will be pardoned , for I am perfectly sensible of ye . Duty of acquiescence & resignation to ye . Supreme Will . Do me ye . favor to read , what has pleased me much , a Poem by S Johnson , -- The Vanity of human Wishes & c & c & c --
