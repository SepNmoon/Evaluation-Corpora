My dear Madam , I am as overjoyed as I can be , in my present low state , at the chance of seeing you again . I am able to dictate but very few words at present , but I hope by the day after Tomorrow to be able to receive you , about noon , if you can be so very kind as to call on me for a few minutes ; My Breast being so weak that I am not allowed to talk , which will be a great mortification to me , after not having had the Happine≈øs of seeing you for so long a time . But I must now bid you adieu , tho I am as much as ever your same , H. W . 29 th March 1792 From ye Earl of Orford Mrs Daniel 48 Welbeck Street To Mrs. Dickenson N o . 21 North Audley Street
