London 25 Feb : -- 87 My dear Friend I hope I may by this time congratulate You on the most perfect recovery of health and strength . You cant imagine how delighted both Mrs. Garrick and I were with the welcome intelligence which Mr. Dickenson so kindly and so early indulged us with . We heartily rejoyced at the appearance of little Miſsy in this wicked World , which I hope she will help to make better , by the excellent Education I am sure she will receive from her dear Pappa and Mamma ; pray a'nt You both vastly delighted with those two Words ? I dare say the first sound of them was the sweetest Music You ever heard . I have been in Town only a week , and have made as much use of my time as a cruel and frequent head ach wou 'd give me leave . My first sortie was to meet two Courtiers of your acquaintance , Mr. Smelt and Miſs Burney ; and a very joyful meeting it was ; it was I think the first evening Miſs B . had ever been out ; for her friends all complain sadly that she is entirely lost to them ; she however appears well and happy ; and being perfectly well dreſsed You cant imagine how pretty She looked She seems to have no complaint of her situation which I rejoyce at ; but want of time and liberty wou 'd be , to my disorderly spirit at least , no small hardships ; but I hope it does not appear so to her . You know that Mr. Smelt , our old flame , is comfortably set down in his pleasant little retreat at Kew ; he is in good health this Winter and looked as handsome as an Adonis last Night , but Mrs. Smelt has her old Asthmas ; they are at Mrs. Cholmly 's , who has a house at Stratford Place we drunk tea with them last night , with only Mrs. Ord and the Young Montagu 's ; Madame goes on well , and I hope , after one or two past disappointments , will be succeſsful this time . Mrs. Montagu has great pleasure in the prospect . From thence we went to Madam Walsingham 's aſsembly ; she said if I wou 'd come she wou 'd get a little talking Party in a corner , and with Mrs. Montagu Mr. Walpole & c. we contrived to make it out decently enough . The ever elegant and ever pleasant Horace is in charming health , and your humble Servant ever ; we have met I think two or three times but not in that comfortable way as to be able to talk you over , en detail , as we shall I trust to morrow night , when we have an Aſsignation at the dear Mrs. Vesey 's ; but Mrs. Carter will be present to see that every thing is proper and prudent and to save our reputation . Mr. Walpole has interested himself in the Old Paston Letters just published . I can not say I am Antiquary enough to be delighted greatly with them ; as letters they do not pretend to much intrinsic worth but as they give some little insight into the domestic manners , as well as information of public events in that bloody period of the Lancastrian Wars , they are certainly matter of great curiosity to the diligent Investigator of old Memoirs : It is curious to see the great Earl of Warwick , the setter up and puller down of Kings writing to a friend in a great exigence to desire he wou 'd lend him ten Pounds . There is one letter which wou 'd be thought admirable in any collection ; it is from the Duke of Suffolk full of prudential and religious advice to his Son . Dear Mrs. Delany has been very seriously ill ; she is still very weak , and I believe sees nobody but Miſs Burney , who tells me that tho she will take a long while before she is re-established , yet she thinks her likely to d o well again , the contrary of which was lately much feared . The Q—— sends Miſs B . to her every day . -- Miſs Boyle was presented last Week , I went to see her with her finery on , and she looked vastly well , and was dreſs 'd with g reat modesty and elegance . She has done marvels this winter , and has made a great progreſs towards decorating the new House at Thames Ditton . I delivered to Mrs. W . Your Meſsage together with the notification of the birth of Your daughter ; and she desired all manner of kind remembrances ; She never names You but with great esteem and high commendations Our friend Mrs. Carter is much as usual ; we have had one Vesey evening with the old Set ; the dear Vesey herself looks pretty well , and is in tolerable health , but subject to fits of low spirits still ; her memory , I think is grievously shattered . She has still the same benevolent delight in collecting her little band of favorites together , but when they are with her I much fear that she can not really enjoy it . Mr. Walpole 's kind and good natured attention to her shews the gentleneſs of his mind in the most amiable point of view . I dare say he often sacrifices his own convenience to amuse and delight her . -- I have not seen the Pepys 's yet , but will remember your message . I have seen Lady Herries , and we talked You over without much slander . My Sister Patty is so delighted with You both that I know not which she is most in love with ; she aſsures me it is a sweet Baby : How provoking that you shou 'd come at a t ime of Year when I am here , just as I shou 'd have wished to be there ! Of Your Charrards I made out Mrs. D . 's ; somebody told me Mr. Foxe , and the French one I am still to learn . Charles James Fox 's Oratorio was very full and splendid on friday ; Buckthorn is gallant and sends Tickets to the Young Ladies , The King and several others ; but honours are not always pleasures for they dare not miſs one I suppose , whether they like them or not , in compliment to the Royal Bear who sends the Tickets . G. R . 's dear little Girl is somewhat better . -- Miſs Penn sends a thousand loves to You and the Blackamoor , both of whom she cordially loves . Adieu . I hope You will go to Bristol , tho it will only increase my regret at not being there . Yours my dear friend most faithfully Ly .
