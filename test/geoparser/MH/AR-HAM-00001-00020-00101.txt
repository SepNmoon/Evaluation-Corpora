N o . 61 Prince 's Street Edinr . 5 th . June 1787 My Dear Sister , Tho ' I have not the pleasure of knowing old Ld Napier , yet I can not help feeling for the accident he has met with , as I can easily gueſs the distreſs & anxiety it must have occasioned you to experience . I trust , however , that the effect of the fall , will not be so bad , as you seemed at first to fear . The date of my Letter may surprise You ; the more so , when I tell you that Edinburgh has been our place of residence since last March . Your letter from Buxton of course went to Ireland & did not find Me out 'till very lately . My only motive for leaving Ireland in March , was to endeavour to be of effectual Use to Mr. D , at the Peers Election . From some of my Correspondents amongst the Peers , I very plainly saw , the Contest would run hard against him , but I still had hopes of his being succeſsfull . The event disappointed Me , & I had the mortification of seeing One of the most disliked Men in the Peerage sent to Parliament . It may poſsibly be of some use to Cathcart , as a Check to that absurd Manner , he has within these few Years thought becoming . The consequential indifference with which he has treated some of his Brethren , lost him Votes . Two particular friends of mine aſsured Me , that had Cathcart behaved in general to them with decency , they would have preferred him to any of the Candidates ; but as his Attention & Civility was only visible when he was canvaſsing , they never would support him -- I am glad your little Cathcart agrees with Spoon meat & I shall be allmost inclined to follow the same plan , should Providence please to add to my family . My poor Louisa suffered violently from the effects of the Itch which her Nurse gave her & which the Child had for three Months before it was suspected . The Nurse was at the same time with Child , which She carefully concealed , 'till her increase of size caught my attention . Had not Mary naturally poſseſsed a good constitution , the bad Milk joined to the Itch would have been sufficient to have destroyed her . We have likewise been obliged to wean my Boy before he was Seven Months old . People who have no Children are constantly wishing for them , & those who are bleſsed with the little things , are kept for many years in a continued state of anxiety . We have bought a House here & consequently propose making this our Head Quarters in future . My Regt- is gone to Halifax & Newfoundland , where I hope I shall not visit them for at least a couple of Years . I bought the house at the expreſs desire of Mary ; You may beleive her wish was not disagreable to Me . T he House which is an excellent o ne with C oac h House , Stables for four Hor ses , Laundry & Wash House , c osts Us £1100 . We have been very busy furnishing it & c which being now accomplished , on friday we set out for Maria s where we mean to remain for two or three Months . This is a little in the Visitation style , but as he seems to wish it & I think Country Air will be good for my family , I shall e'en make a convenience of his invitation . My sister Sir T. Clavering now forms part of my Establishment & is to accompany Us to Axwell . She makes a pleasant Addition to out family , & I flatter myself her situation in it will be full as agreable as where she has been for some time past . On my arrival , I enquired for your Cousin Harriet , who I found was obliged to leave Town the day after we came here , on account of the illneſs of his father . He has not yet returned . Mr. Dickenson begs her wishes for the health & happyneſs of You & Yours may be added to those of my Dear Sister 's Affect . Friend & Brother Maria P.S . I hope Napier is convinced of his Jerryism Direct to me , Axwell Park , Gateshead . Mr D . Taxall Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
