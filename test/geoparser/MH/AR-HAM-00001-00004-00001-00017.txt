Dear Miſs Hamilton ; The hurry I have been in for some time past in moving my Family to Town , has prevented my thanking you for your last of the 8 th . Inst . much longer than I cou 'd have wish 'd . I have by good fortune got a most elegant and complete house in every respect in the best street in Dublin , and quite convenient to the outlet leading to my Villa , from whence I am every morning supplied with the produce of my little Farm & Garden in much greater perfection than I cou 'd get the same things from the market . I am sincerely happy in the account you give me of your encreasing good fortune , and am persuaded that the same prudence that guided you in your former situation , will point out the proper line line of conduct in your present more arduous one . Your understanding with the experience you have had is perfectly sufficient to direct you in almost any case that can offer ; nothing can hurt you but flattery which I know you have always held in abhorrence ; its object is fatally bent to undermine the judgement by instilling into the unguarded mind an arrogant self-approbation instead of a noble simplicity of conduct which will guide you safely , being the qualification of all others the most proper for your situation . Make no apologies to me , I beg , for not answering my letters with precise punctuality , I know how much you time is engaged , besides the very idea of your thinking yourself in default might prevent that frankneſs which renders your correspondence so interesting and agreeable . I received a letter some time ago from Lady Stormont acquainting me with the application she had made in my favor ; I must say it was a very feeble effort and that it merited no other answer from Ld . Carlisle than what it produced . It was from the K——g alone that I entertain 'd any hopes , and I find that Ld . Stormont has changed his sentiments with regard to my Memorial and the probability of its having effect , for when I shew 'd it to him , he said it was very proper and even proposed an amendment to it himself , which I agreed to & said at last , perhaps Miſs H . can put you into a method of getting it presented ; but you will do me the justice to recollect my sentiments with regard to your interference , which are still invariably the same ; I wish 'd to be considerd by you as a safe and disinterested friend , that idea must for ever have been loſs 'd by my wanting to put you into an improper and dangerous situation . The case is quite different with Ld . Stormont , who at present is very sorry that Ecclesiastical Preferments are not in his department , which is as much as if he said he never will serve me , as I do not mean to ask for any civil employment . Do not suppose My Dear Miſs Hamilton that I am disappointed or made unhappy by these answers . I have made the experiment of the estimation I stand in with my Friends , it was indeed with reluctance & totally against my own judgement , however by having done it , I have acquitted myself and can not hereafter be reproach 'd with having fail 'd through my own indolence . I believe I cou 'd have born a little more prosperity with an equal mind ; but at the same I have never suffer 'd anxious expectations to make me unmindful of the great bleſsings I am daily enjoying . I have now very nearly attained the age of 52 ; is not that rather too late a period to think of creating a new interest ? With what I have at present I believe you will readily agree with me , little can be expected ; and to suppose that I shall never obtain anything upon my own account woud be doating , which I hope to put off for some little time longer . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be affectionately rememberd to you . Mrs. Stratford is in Town , the turmoils between her & her untoward Husband give us much uneasineſs God knows what may be the end of them ! Adieu , My Dear Miſs Hamilton believe me ever with the sincerest Affection Your faithful Friend & Uncle . Frederick Hamilton Sackville Street , Dublin November 27 th . 1780
