Hampton 25 Janry : My dear Friend The sole reason why I have n ot sooner thanked for your kind letter is , that being quite isolée at Hampton , I know nothing of the world or its ways ; and I wished to defer writing till I had gone to Town , and looked up a little a musement and goſsip for you among our friends . But I find we shall not stir this fortnight , -- I came here early in December . Mrs. Garrick and I spent the Christmas fortnight a t Mrs. Walsingham 's . We had no other company except Lord Walsingham , for a day or two at one time , and Mr. Pepys for a couple of days at another time . I frequently read to them ( I mean Mrs. W . and her daughter ) while they painted , and if it is any comfort to you , you were often affectionately remember 'd , and kindly talked of . The little time they wou 'd spare me to myself I employ 'd in finishing a little Tale which will see the light in a few days . I have ventured to glance pretty strongly at the manners of our fine Men ; the gluttony , rudeneſs , ignorance , and indolence of modern Ton . I had fully resolved to have brought it out without my name , but was over-ruled by the only two friends to whom I ever named it . They also insisted on my adding Bas bleu , which else , woud probably have made its way into some Magazine from the numerous copies that are got abroad . Mr. Walpole , is I hear , better and Mrs. Vesey tolerable . I have seen neither of those dear friends : nor indeed any one else , but Mrs. Boscawen , Montagu , and Carter , the latter only for 5 Minutes ; she seemed not quite well . I know you will honour my fortitude when I tell you that I this day resisted a very agreeable temptation . We had a letter from Mrs. Walsingham to ask us to the annual dinner of the Warton 's & c. You know full well how pleasant it is , and how delightful they are ; but an account of the dangerous illneſs of my Mother , left not my Spirits in tune for this sweet Musick . -- I hope your amiable friend Lady Wake has somewhat recovered the severe shock her feelings experienced . You are a good creature to go and administer the consolations of friendship to her affliction . That affords the best human help I know of . I wish it were in my power to suggest any thing which might be serviceable to your worthy Clergyman ; but tho ' rich in will I am poor in power . You cant imagine how I shall miſs You when I paſs by the dear old house ! -- but I ought to fortify Your virtue , instead of weakning it by such rememberances . Yet how little is what You have re no unced compared with the solid and substantial happineſs you have secured by your union with an amiable and virtuous Man ! You deserve your happineſs because You are sensible of it . I doubt not his affairs will go on prosperously now that he has taken them into his own hands . -- I asked Sir William if she wou 'd not write ; she said no , You must not have too many good things at once . In truth as we had but little to say we cou 'd not both afford to speak at the same time . -- She sends her kind love to both . -- I have not only no frank , but what is a ridiculous kind of poverty , I am not worth a folio Sheet of Paper , or you shoud not have come off so easily . -- I rejoyce that that sweet Mrs. G . is so agreeably married . I fell quite in love with when I was at Ken Wood . -- As to the Narrative about Miſs Murray , There are some things which stagger me very much . At first I saw no great reason to believe in the identity of the two persons ; but I was desired to examine her head , as marks of violence were said to be on that of the foreigner , I had her head shaved , and found the very scars : there are several other strong circumstances . I wou 'd I had more room ; but if I had , I cou 'd never tell You how much I am Yr . faithful Louisa To H. More at Mrs. Dickenson 's Bart Courteen Hall near Northampton
