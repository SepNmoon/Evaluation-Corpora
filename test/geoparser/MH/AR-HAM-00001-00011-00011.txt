Chelsea Sepr : 17 th : 1781 To be sure there seems , my Dear Miſs Hamilton to be a spell upon The my Books , which I had set my heart on getting so immediately for her Majesty ; as I mentioned in my Letter to you , I sent to Town the Morning I writ to you -- & Lord Dartrey kindly went himself to Robson to hasten him ; -- about Eleven o'Clock , he came down , with the Book in his hand , & told me it was at last done ; -- I was really quite delighted , but only think of my disappointment , & poor Dear Lord Dartrey 's too -- when I looked to see if it was properly bound , & found it paged intirely wrong ; with finis in the Middle . -- It required all Epictetus 's Philosophy -- to hear this with patience -- Lord D stood my Friend again , took it to the Bookseller , & at length it is arrived , & I send it with this Letter , & beg you will take a proper Opportunity of presenting it with my humble Duty to the Queen -- & at the same time inform her Majesty how sorry I am that the little Book is not yet come from Bristol ; I sent this Morning to the Bookseller for it , & he sent me that unsatisfactory Answer . I flatter myself the Table of Cebes will please the Queen . I am happy to hear you are well , & Miſs Goldsworthy better . -- Mrs : Quin is here with me , & I am now beginning to go & see the Sights , in & about London -- Lord D—— is gone away for a week , & has left it in charge with me to see shew her Westminster Abbey & c & c & c She is a delightful Companion ; has a great deal of real taste ; & a most excellent Understanding -- poor Soul , She suffers much by nervous Complaints ; but with a quiet & composure which is quite edifying -- Adieu my Dear Miſs Hamilton , believe me Yrs : very Affectionately PDartrey pray let me hear from you when you have leisure , & tell me how the Queen likes the Book -- I shall be quite happy if it has been in my power to present her Majesty with any thing that can afford her pleasure & amusement . how good & gracious She is to Me ! -- pray my Dear ; when you have an Opportunity , do me Justice by aſsuring her Majesty how sincerely I feel her great goodneſs to Me -- once more Adieu .
