In answer to yrs on Th——y recd- Friday 19 th Novbr- afternoon ¾ past 6 oclock Oh be not angry thou dearest whimsical Creature yt . ever existed you was not so , tho ' you said it , you cld .. not help being pleased with me notwithstanding I did to be sure give a little twist to yr : meaning . I repeat I do not desist from what I already said yt . you are equally amiable , agreable , & dear in whatever humor you are , but you are certainly a little whimsical , odd , unaccountable , comical , romantick creature . Now I have spit my fire . As to yr . desiring me to advise you concerning yr . conduct towards , yt . impudent little liar , who is so proper to give it you as yrself . I will now give you a little information with regard to his conduct towards , & then I will give you my advice ; he has been very shy of speaking to me , & rather appeared afraid of me , perceiving with what reserve I treat him , he is conscious I suppose of his ill behaviour towards me , by making such free mention of my name , now my dearest Miranda , ye first time he offers to conduct you over ye way or his hand to yr . C h air , I wld .. have you treat him with yt . cold reserve encreasing it to full such a degree , till you think it time to drop his acquaintance entirely , such is my advice my Friend , I give it you because I think it ye best , however you had much better follow ye impulse of yr . own mind , nothing can be a better guide to you than ye . rectitude of yr . intentions . I wish to know how you escape at this time of ye . Year , catching Cold , my Brother ha d s a bad Cold , & Cough , & as for me I am now beginning I believe to have one too , for I have a great soarneſs on my breast , & Cough , however I hope with proper care it will be nothing . I wish you to instruct my Meſsenger , as far as you know , what Days , or what hours wld .. be most convenient for him to call upon you when we arrive in # # I wish you wld .. give ym- me in writing . After ye . first w eek of yr . arrival , I shall expect to see , hear & find you just such a Madcap as you used to be , when you get among yr . Friends , what a giddy thing thou wilt be , however I need not caution you to think of me wherever you go , my heart will always attend you . I am doubting very much whether or no I shall send you ye . Book I intended to send you , I certainly shall not send it you till you have been among yr . friends , together with a little diſsipation for more than a Month , for I understand it is a Book filled with ye . finest tenderest & most delicate feelings . & such a Book in short , yt . wld .. a good deal lower my Miranda 's spirits therefore I am determined not to send such a Book until I am convinced her spirits are better than they are at present . Ad . Ad . Ad . My Friend , my Sister , my Miranda , may you ever be as fortunate & happy , as yr . virtues deserve , I am Yr . ever sincerely affectionate Brother Palemon . toujours de même . P.S . I am in hopes of seeing you to morrow Evening pray keep yrself disingaged for I shall be unhappy if you are not . A . A . A . . toujours chére
