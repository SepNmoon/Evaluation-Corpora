Saturday -- 4 Sepr . 13 As soon as I had sent off my letter by the old Post Woman I took my Fishing Rod & went to the River & had only one Shower of Rain & very good Sport -- if I had been an Adept my Bag would have been distended as it was I brought a very pretty Dish of Trouts which were acceptable as Two Gentlemen dined here Revd . Mr. Bere a sensible Clergyman & a Mr. Badcock who made his fortune in America & is settled in this Neighborhood -- In my sport I forgot the perpendicular hill I went around before dinner & had hard work to return in time as it requires half a Mile an hour to come from the bridge which is only a mile -- Sunday -- We went to Church at 11 -- a very decent Congregation in the morning -- I was gratified by the manner in which yr- Knight discharged his Duty as a Parish priest -- his Voice is loud & clear & he reads extremely well -- I told him if Clergymen were paid by the Tenor of the Voice , in the proportion as fine Ladies pay their Footman wages by their Heigth , his Salary would be immense -- his Voice would fill Westminster Abbey -- without an effort -- After service I took the poney & rode to the Bridge to take a Sketch of it for Louisa & tho it is a very rude Attempt , I presume she will understand it is meant for a Bridge without much explanation -- The Scenery about it is beautiful -- The afternoon Service was well attended -- the Church was crammed full -- James had a Christening & a Churching -- and the Children sang their Catechism -- & he gave us an excellent Sermon on the Nature of the Catechism -- There is a fine Orchestra -- 3 Ladies sing who are much superior to Catalani -- Mrs. Vaughan & Miſs Hay have 3 Violins & 2 Players on the Violoncello -- So that the Band are sure of one Performer -- I observed when these Operators wish to shew their Talents & give a Shake wch . frequently occurs -- they give the Inſtrument a good hearty Shake -- & once to produce the same effect , the performer drew his Bow two or three Times over the same Note rapidly which produces a degree of Melody that Nothing can exceed & at the same time proves his taste & fine Ears -- After evening Service Mrs . & Miſs P . rode to Bampton & as soon as they returned the Rain began & has seldom ceased for many minutes -- Monday -- Constant Rain has prevented our going a hunting or rather to see a Hunt -- if the y Sportsmen really go out & find a Deer they will be as wet as wet -- We talk of going tomorrow to Exeter but unleſs there is a probability of better weather it will not be advisable Mrs. P—— shewed me a fine Collection of China -- She has some beauties & one handsome set with the Arms -- In examining my fishing apparatus this morning I found two small fish that were overlooked for you must know dinner was ready when I returned from fishing but as twelve fish were produced they were immediately dreſsed & very delicious they were & the Visitors & all had a feast -- There is a Custom in this house that at first teazed me -- there are two Clocks on the Stair Case or rather Landing -- one strikes half an hour before the other & they should be kept exact -- the late Mr. P . liked to have an Alarm Clock for the Servants to let thm know that the real time of Day was approaching Phoebe would fall asleep in listening for the second -- There is also a Clock in the Kitchen which keeps the Cook 's time & another in the Library -- It is delightful to hear Mrs. P . speak of her late Husband , She describes him as the most perfect of human beings -- She is still in the Deepest Mourning & I dare say will never change -- Miſs P . is also in the same dreſs -- I forgot to mention that Mr. Brickdale who is a Man of large fortune & lives two miles from hence has made some thatched Huts in his Woods in places that command the most interesting Scenes & here the families in the Neighborhood often resort in summer time & carry a cold dinner -- Mr. P . was very fond of these excursions & on these Occasions Mr. Brickdale would let off a piece of Water from the top of those Woods which came foaming & dashing down the Wood in a great torrent & he would fish off a Corner when the Reverberations were magnificently sublime -- Mrs. P . is fond of a Garden & takes as much pains as her Cousin Sarah -- At this moment she is at work in a heavy shower -- Miſs P . has knocked at the Window to no purpose -- She wont hear -- There is a News paper that comes here twice a week -- a country paper -- one may get used to any thing -- I know nothing that has paſsed since I left Town & am very content -- I am rather sorry that Mrs. Baldwin discovered the grand Secret but She may thank herself for it -- I really felt offended with her the last time She was at our house & walked out of the Room as she was too mad to be talked to & I dare say my Countenance & manner were legible enough -- I will own she teazes me exceſsively & She so frequently makes you nervous & fatigued that I feel no particular anxiety for her Company -- Independently of our affection for Nanny Clarke -- Mad as She is -- She can command herself & be very agreeable & then there is such a Sweetneſs of disposition naturally that one can bear wh . her Oddities -- but Mrs. B . 's are perversities -- quite a different thing -- A fine Peacock at the Window reminds me of Taxal -- James contends that he is a finer Bird than at Bullock s Museum The tai l of this Bird is absent at present therefore I can not judge of natural dimensions -- If Louisa was here She would have fine Subjects for her pencil as Memorandums -- The Clouds are magnifique -- & paſsing by the Window wh- great Rapidity -- I hope Madam de S. H will recover her Spirits to the Tone they were in when she sketched Louisa s Likeneſs or she will not perfect the Character which she has so well conceived -- Poor Robert is just come into the Room -- he is tall & well looking very like Miſs P—— his effort in speaking seems very laborious as he can not use his Tongue -- I understand him tolerably -- he is very good humored -- his legs are very weak -- his feet not straight & he walks with difficulty -- & has little use of his hands -- he can open a Door & unlock a padlock with a great effort -- His Amusement is taking care of some Rabits & his exercise going to visit them frequently I am going to make him some proper Pens as the poor Creatures are kept without light & air & he seems much pleased at the thoughts of it & understands my Description of the proper management -- it is a melancholy Object for a tenderhearted Mother to have constantly under her Observation -- . 12 Oclock -- have just recd . Yrs . of Friday the second letter , I meant to have presented you wh . a Bullfinch -- I did not go to the Keadges as I thought their invitation a shuffling one like a Yorkshire preſsing -- Birds may be very scarce here -- for there is no Shooting -- The Corn will not be cut in my time -- There is a fatality about my Shooting -- I have had very good Fishing which I could not have had at the hospitable Benning brough so the comparison is in my favor as Fishing is a Nuelty -- Mrs. de S . will not like high prices at Brighton -- Staying a week leſs makes the difference I should like to go there if you & L . approve of it -- I agree wh- Mor . that Louisa s face in the picture seems larger than Nature but it will be different when properly shaded -- by giving the Head a twist , on the outside as thank God there is some within -- She has shewn a double Chin which increases the size of the face & tho natural to the Creation in that position which she is fond of is not exactly what I should have chosen -- but I am content -- it will be a Resemblance of our Dear Girl , who 's Mind is as innocent as the pretty little Pea Chick at the Window -- Adieu Accept Love from hence to every Body -- most Affy- Yr . own JD Single To Mrs. Dickenson 32 Devonshire Place London
