My Dear Mrs. Dickenson I believe I have suffered a greater share of mental afflictions than usually falls to the lot of man . What has added greatly to my distreſs is that they have been principally domestic . I have for near twenty years past been agitated with the bitter reflections that I was the Parent of as worthleſs a being as coud exist , for whom from an early period of his life you conceived a partiality from the false idea that I was deficient towards him in parental affection & on the persua= that he was a proper object of your regard , you invited him to your house ; where you had soon an opportunity of witneſsing the development of his character ; many circumstances of which were communicated to me in an offensive manner . Tho ' I have always found my Son 's villainous plots deeply laid , & implying great sagacity , you madam , it seems , have imputed his multiplied enormities to his constitutio= weakneſs , a greater error than the former I have complained of respecting my want of attention to him . The plea of parental affection to an object so depraved , operated with me in a contrary direction , & instead of compaſsion excited my detestation . cou 'd the circumstances of my past years be known , my zealous admiration for truth wou 'd , I hope , appear a prominent feature ; and what has attached me so ardently to my unfortunate daughter Mrs. Holman is the the beauty of her character , eminently conspicuous for truth & honorable principles . My Son since his return from Copenhagen with a female companion calling herself by his name authorized by marriage in that City , as she alledges , but which I was always aſsur 'd had not taken place , tho ' she has cohabited with him at least 13 years & has always attended him faithfully in his illneſses which have been very frequent , has received from me in addition to his allowance £400 pr An , clear of all deductions , considerably more than £2000 & yet he has died completely insolvent leaving a debt hind him of great amount behind him to his creditors , but to what extent I am not yet informed , tho ' I am told it will be a claim upon my generosity , in which I shall certainly disappoint their expectations . To give you a specimen of his enormous extravagance I had this day presented to me a well authenticated demand ed by a ship builder who had contracted with him for a sailing ornament veſsel the cost of which was to amount to £1200 but being struck with his folly , he had persuaded the ship builder to release him from his contract by a premium of £200 for which he produced my Son s obligation . The unfortunate woman in the mean time must not be left to starve in a strange country without friends , that is indeed a claim I am not inclin 'd to controvert . See what a detail you have exposed yourself to by imputing a life of premeditated villainies to constitutional weakneſs ! cou 'd they poſsibly have proceeded from such a cause , I shou 'd not have been wanting in charitable sentiments . Tho ' I abhor Bath , bowed down as I am by the weight of years & their concomitant infirmities , I can not now th ink of making a change of residence . With my kind Compts . to Miſs Dickenson I remain My Dear Madam Your Affectionate humble Servant Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St . Bath December 3 rd . 1809 .
