My Dear Miſs Hamilton I beg you to deliver the enclosed to the Princeſs Royal , & to present my humble Duty to their Majesties & to the Princes & Princeſses . As soon as I had sent you my Letter I gave orders for a Supper for Genl Carpenter & the three Gentlemen Ushers , who arrived between 8 & 9 ; they seem 'd much pleas 'd with that Attention , & at a very little after Twelve , I resign 'd my dear little Royal Charge into their Care , an Office it was impoſsible to perform without feeling it tenderly , as indeed every body seem 'd to do that was present at the Scene ; it closes with such endleſs Happineſs to him , that tis for ourselves only we feel when we lament it . I hope the King & Queen receive all the Comfort from that Thought , it ought to bring , & that I shall soon have the Satisfaction of Seeing them & all that are nearest to them return in health to this Place wch : looks so desolate without them . Miſs Goldsworthy is but indifferent I think & the Busineſs of last Night sat very heavy upon her , however I hope her Blister & keeping my quiet will set her up again . Our miserable rainy Weather I am afraid must have been very troublesome at Kew , thō the Princeſses Letters speak of your walking a good deal . Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton ; I am sorry my Franker is gone or you shd . not have to pay for a double Letter , Ever most Sincerely Yrs . CFinch Windsor Augt . 27 th . 1782 .
