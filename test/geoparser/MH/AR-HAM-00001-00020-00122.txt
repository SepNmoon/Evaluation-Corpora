Wilton Lodge 30 th . July 1793 . My Dear Sister , Maria was safely delivered , this afternoon , of a Son . She has had a good sleep since , & I trust in God , will do as well , as on former occasions . Try to follow her example . Be a good Girl , & produce a Boy too , without playing any more tricks . It was shabby in You not to visit my Farm , this Summer . With my best wishes to Mr. Dickenson & your female Brat , I remain ever with great sincerity & affection , your much attached Brother & Friend Napier . Mrs= Dickenson Birchhall Manchester by Carlisle
