16 th . Octbr . 1779 Satry . afternoon ½ past 4 Dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , Miranda I sincerely thank you for this additional instance of yr . confidence , tho ' I wanted no further proof of it than what you had already given me , of How different are yr . views from those of yr . family 's friends , but I can not help esteeming yr . family not only for its own intrinsick parts , but because it has ye honor of claiming my dearest Miranda , which is more than any other family can boast of . Yr . friend M. G . I love and esteem for her vertues , as if she was my own friend , she is my friend , for what friend is there of my Miss ( Charlotte ) Gunning that being acquainted with my friendship , love , & affection for her wld .. not also be my friend . You tell me nothing of ye . situation of yr . health , & spirits , or whether yr . dreadful pain in yr . side has again reminded you that it once took such hold of you , you do not consider how anxious I am upon these several heads , my whole happineſs as I have often told you centers entirely yrs . you know it does , & you believe it , but at times , out of pure méchanceté as you alone you pretend not to it in order to alarm me . How cld .. my dearest Sister suppose yt . what she writes wld .. either be tiresome , disagreable , or trivial in my eyes ; you must have conceived a very different opinion of me from that which you had , to suppose my ever being capable of such a thing . I hope ye . Birds I sent you , proved good , they were totally meant for you . I sent one to Miranda at ye . same time I sent you yrs . yesterday . Adieu for ye . present if I can I will write you a Note for Tomorrow Morning . To tell you my ever dearest Sr. George Mettam , that I love , honor , & esteem you , is to tell you what I think you are perfectly aſsured of , therefore excuse me when I repeat it over to you again , & believe me ever to be , Yr . ever affectionate Brother Miranda toujours de même . P.S . I have not received any Paterns as yet , but will forward ym .. to you as soon as I receive ym .. for yr . opinion . I have heard we are besides this long jaunt to W——r to paſs ye . C——ſsChristmass H——s there , I shall have ye happineſs of seeing my Palemon more frequently than I had flattered my ſelf . Tell me every thing you hear concerning W—— You have not of late signed yrself , my Sister as well as Friend , & called me by ye . name of Brother whh .. I wish to see you do again . Ad . Ad . Ad . dearest dearest , dearest Miranda . toujours chére . Since I wrote ye . Postscript I have received from Town some Paterns of some cloaths my Taylor says they are ye most fashionable wear for Gentlemen & speaks truth , pray chuse one & tell me truly yr .. ideas . Ad . Ad . Ad . ma bien aimée . I know not how it is
