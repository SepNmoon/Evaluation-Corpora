Chelsea Farm May 11 th : My Dearst . Mrs : Dickenson 's kind Letter I recd : on Saturday & as no Post went out I could not ansr : it till to Day ; I am very sorry you have been so much alarmed about us . & I told Ly.- Wake of yr : kind anxiety when I saw her last night -- She says her Letter must have miscarried , as She wrote a very long one & sent it to Miſs Anne Clarke , who was to write at the same time ; I have the Comfort however of aſsuring you that Lady Wake is very tolerably well , & looked remarkably well yesterday , & Marianne & Charlotte both pretty well -- They were all at Ranelagh on Friday , so you may set yr : friendly Heart at ease upon their account ; Sr : Wm : is also pretty well , & Ly : W . has had the pleasure of seeing her dear Rich during the Easter Holidays , -- & having great comfort in his Company . Your account of your Celebration of our Dear King 's Recovery pleased me & my Husband very much -- we should have rejoiced at seeing your little Louisa admiring Grandpapa & Mama dancing together . I do believe you were more chearful tha t n the Pantheon Company ; & as to the Opera House Ball , I have not heard of one Person who did not complain of the Heat & the Crowd , & seem rather more disappointed than pleased . The Poor Cottager 's Illumination went to my Heart , tho ' it was not quite so touching & affecting , as a Poor Cobler in London who had continued having a little bit of Oiled Paper by way of Transparency , with these words only , “ Thank God . ” Another poor Creature who had no Home or settled Lodging , walked about in a quiet manner with 2 farthing Candles stuck upon a Board , wh : he carried upon his Head -- & a Chairman lighted the Top of an Old Sedan Chair , with five Candles stuck in Clay . I had the pleasure of shewing to the Queen some Verses made by a poor Woman who aſsisted a Poor Mantua Maker that made the Cloathing for the Children of the School of Industry -- Oh ! how I do wish you cd : have been here on the 10 th : of March 2 3 8 little Girls my Dr : Husband cloathed from Head to Foot besides the neceſsary Apparel as Gown , Shift & c each had a little Black Bonnet , white Tippet & white Thread Gloves & white Bibs & aprons -- wh : made them look very neat indeed -- They walked 2 & 2 -- from near Ranelagh where They dined in a large Room -- followed by all the Sunday Schools , & every other Ch Sc hool in Chelsea to the number of 378 Children -- & they were placed in Rows upon the Lawn to sing “ God save the King , ” to a Band of very good Music . We all went to Chelsea Chapel with them first where they Sung a Hymn made upon the Occasio n & the Sight of such a number of littl e Children on one side , & the Old Soldiers o n the other was quite affecting -- indeed I was very thankful to be in a Pew where I was not seen , as I cd : shed my Tears , unperceived , but by Mrs : Allen who was moved almost as much as I was . Wedy- By Lady Wake 's Letter wh : before this time you have recd : you will find I have not been well but I bleſs God I am better since I came here . I believe I exerted myself a little too much at Windsor , where I paſsed a Week after the crowded Drawing Room -- & had the Honr : & infinite pleasure of being at the first Entertainment wh : our Dr : King gave after his Illness -- I did not get to Bed till past 3 o'Clock , & it was too much for me -- as soon as I returned to Town , I was taken Ill , & have not been well since -- but I aſsure you my Dr : Friend I am better , & as a proof of it my Husband is going to Ireland next Monday sennight . He is thank God pure well -- he begs his Love to you & Joins me in kindest Comps : to Mr. D . who we hope is in good Health -- & yr : dr : little Louisa . I hope to see Mrs : Carter tomorrow & will give yr : Meſsage . I am very sorry I cd : do nothing about the Snuff Box -- for Mrs : Handcock 's Brother had every Thing given up to Him -- before I Rec 'd yr : Letter -- & as She had ( poor dr : Woman ) another Brother & a Sister an equal Division was to be made -- I wd : not have had it without offering to pay for it , wh : I do not believe he wd : have allowed -- & I know if you knew all Circumstances , you wd : not have taken it otherwise . I told Mrs : C . yr : kind Intention . My Paper obliges me to say Adieu & Believe me my Dr : Friend Yrs : very Affectly PC I detained this Letter for a Frank , but as I am not likely to get one -- I shall send it away without , & I know you will excuse me for so doing I have sent for the Book you mention To Mrs : Dickenson at Taxal near Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
