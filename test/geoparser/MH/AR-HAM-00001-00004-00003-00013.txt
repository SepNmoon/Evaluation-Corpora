London . March the 2 nd - 1790 . My dear Cousin , It was my Intention to have written to you by Mr : Dickenson , but one Interruption or another the Day or two before his Departure , prevented me . However , perhaps a Letter may be more acceptable to you now , than it wou 'd have been then -- as Mr : Dickenson wou 'd of Course , tell you any little Article of News that might be to be met with during his Stay here . I need not tell you how very agreeably surprised we were to see Mr : Dickenson in London , nor how happy to hear such good accounts of you and your charming little Daughter . Our not being to see you and her this Season is a great Disappointment to us -- however , your Reasons are so good , that we take Patience , and comfort ourselves with the Idea that ce qui est différé , n'est pas perdu , as the French say . I dare say your Cottage ( as you call it , ) will be made very commodious and pretty , and will do Credit to Mr : Dickenson 's Taste in Architecture , altho ' his first Eſsay . I suppose you have heard of my Father 's having exchanged his Living in Ireland for one in Suffolk -- He has lost considerably by the Exchange , and yet is not discontented with it -- that sounds rather odd ; but the Fact is , he was not very easy about holding the Living in Ireland , and never residing upon it -- This one in Suffolk will serve us for a Villa in the Summer , and will be some Amusement to his Mind , so I think all is very well . My Brother is with his Regiment at Nottingham -- We are in daily Expectation of a Letter from him at present . We have not yet had a Concert -- only small musical Parties en famille -- You ask me about Miſs Mathew -- she no longer aſsists me by singing -- She had the good Taste to despise Mr : Marchesi 's Style , and behaved with so little Politeneſs to me on the first Season of my learning of him , that our Intercourse ceased . We have another great Singer here now -- Sigr : Pacchierotti -- I dare say Mr : Dickenson has mention 'd him to you -- he is , besides , a most amiable , and very clever , Man . The Opera-House is to be built in Leicester-Square -- Gallini is to have nothing to do with it -- a Mr : O'Reilly is to have the Management . Mr : Marchesi is expected in London this Night , to my great Joy . Madame Mara is to be the first Woman in the serious Opera . The little Theatre in the Hay-Market is made as commodious as it can be -- it is not spacious enough to be sure -- but certainly it is better to have the Opera there , than to have none . I have been pretty often at the Play this Season , though poor Mrs : Siddons has not performed -- We have been very near losing her -- but I am happy to say that she is now , certainly recovering . I saw her the other Morning for the first Time -- she is amazingly reduced , but that is said to be a good Symptom , as Bulk after so violent an Illneſs cou 'd not be natural -- consequently , wou 'd be unwholesome . She was in very tolerable Spirits , and looked very handsome and interesting . I heard good Accounts of my Sister , a few Days ago , from a Gentleman just come from Dublin -- I hear oftener of her than from her , for she is a lazy Creature at writing . I am sure nothing wou 'd make my Brother more happy than visiting you and Mr : Dickenson , were he in your Neighbourhood -- and I dare say his Regiment will be sometimes quartered at Manchester You tell me that I am mistaken , for that your Daughter is not spoilt -- You are mistaken yourself , for I never imagined she was -- I am too well persuaded of your excellent Judgement in the Management of Youth , to fear your spoiling her . As to GrandPapa , I do n't know what to say about him , for Mr : Dickenson says he is pretty much under the young Lady 's Dominion . I long to see her -- I hear much of her . My Father and Mother join in best Wishes and Regards to you and Mr : Dickenson , and I remain affectionately yours . Jane Hamilton P.S . Pray remember me to Mr : Dickenson .
