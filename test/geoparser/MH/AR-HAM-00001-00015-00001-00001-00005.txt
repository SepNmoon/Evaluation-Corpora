My dear Friend , I find one moment before they call me to go to the Play , to ask you how you do and when you came to Town -- I am just arrived and very well , tho ' as miserable , about my dearest Bell who is no better -- I suppose you were too much engaged to write -- but I am not unreasonable enoug h to expect it -- I am going in a few days to Bell and must see you first , I shall be at home on Monday which if you could come to me , I should prefer -- if you can not , will come to you on Sunday -- let me know immediatly adieu God bless you CMG -- send me an answer in the morng early
