Morng ½ past 9 My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , I have been greatly afraid that you must have thought me very impertinent when I sent to you ye . other day for it looked as if I intended to pry into yr . secrets , and was resolved to know them thoroughly , however Heaven knows that was far from being my object , it was only to know whether you went to L—— or not for that melancholy purpose which I suspected , or not . As long as ye . idea remained it persecuted me until I had sent to you to inform myſelf , yr . answer I think my Friend was not quite so ingenuous as yrs . generally are , for it was that you went to L—— in order to enjoy ye . sweets of L—— D—— 's Society , this has not as yet relieved me totally from my fears , for you must own this was not quite answering my question , as I know that L—— D—— is an intimate friend of yrs , this for some time rather strengthned my fears as I thought it was merely to converse these matters over with her that you went to pay her this visit . However I do not think you would , from yr affection to me , leave me in suspense if there was any ground for my fears , for you know to what extravagant Lengths my paſsion wld .. probably carry me , were I to think there was any foundation for my alarms . Pardon if I recall to yr . memory my dearest , dearest , dearest Angel , yr . promise by which I you bound yrself to me , I hope you have not found it irksome , ye terms set to it of my being at liberty can not now be far distant , this is a still stronger argument which I take ye liberty of mentioning to you ; a little diſsipation , & ye . bustle & hurry of a publick life during ye . Winter , will I flatter myself free you from those Vapors , which I am afraid at times you are apt to be troubled with , pardon my freedom , it is that of one friend writing to another , for where is ye . use in friendship if one can not tell each other with freedom one 's ideas . Be not offended my sweetest friend if I tell you in ye . vulgar phraise , that I have still another crow to pull with you , this it is , you wrote to me in yr . last note that you committed yr . answer to one former L—— to ye . flames , what could there be in that Letter which was improper for me to see or to read , unleſs it was something you thought wld .. give me pain and in that case I thank you for yr . tenderneſs towards me , you must be ye . best Judge , yrself what there was proper or improper in it however , I nevertheleſs lost my answer . I also complain that you called me Sir throughout ye . whole of yr . last Note , and concluded with calling me once only by ye affectionate Name of Friend , let us banish out of ye . Dictionary such words as , Sir , Yr . R . H . gracious , and such like nonsensical expreſsions , which are only fit for Court friends , which are a disgrace to Ye . word Friend . Now you must allow it is fair for me to scold a little in my turn at times , this in return for ye . affectionate scolding Letter you sent me some time ago , let me see whether you will be so ready to correct yr . little failings , as I am desirous and endeavouring to correct my great faults . Adieu dearest , dearest dearest Friend excuse my breaking off so abruptly , but I have scarce a moment to fold this up , I only beg you will believe , that there is nobody who has yr . happineſs more at heart , or that is more attached to you , or that loves you to a greater degree , than Yr . sincerely affectionate Palemon . P.S . Pray inform me as soon as you hear any thing of W . or if you hear anything more of ye impertinence either of Mr. H . or of W. R . -- encore Adieu , Adieu , Adieu tout ce qui m'est cher au monde , Votre Palemon toujours de mêm e
