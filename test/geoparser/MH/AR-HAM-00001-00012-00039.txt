Deal Castle . May 30 th . 1782 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton This Letter was intended for Yesterdays Post but I found it was too late & therefore was obliged to deferr it till to day , when I can have the Satisfaction of continuing the good Accounts I have been able hitherto to send constantly of our little Prince , & which I beg you to communicate to their Majesties . I think there is no doubt of the Sea bathing agreeing with him , his Nights are so much mended & his Appetite so good , that he must gain Ground , & thō his Face is not any thing like clear of the Irruption that disfigured it , yet it rather appears to be the remains of what has been than any fresh breaking out . The Eye-lid that seem 'd so much affected is also getting better , & therefore I hope will not have any effect of weak'ning the Eye , which I was a little afraid of . You will have heard of the happineſs I have had of Seeing my Son at his first Landing , he hurried away to London to be in time for his presentings preperatory to appearing at the Birth-day , for which I suppose you are all now very busy in preparing . We shall open our Windows again for the firing of the Guns , which shakes the Castle so , that if it was not for that Precaution they would all be broke & the Sound is very tremendous , P. Alfred however is very courageous upon the occasion & seems rather to like it , We have had that Ceremony twice the first time in honor of his Arrival , & the last on the Restoration Day . Mrs Carter I have often the pleasure of Seeing , & except her usual Head-achs , think She appears vastly well & cheerful . My little Girls are quite delightful 'Companions to me , & if the Weather was not so windy & cold I believe would prevail on me sometimes to walk upon the Sands with them which they are very fond of ; but I have not yet been able to attempt , but paſs a great deal of my time by a Fireside ( wch you will hardly credit ) in a pretty little room that has a delightful View of the Sea . I have begun reading Antonis de Solis in Spanish , Mrs Carter having furnish 'd me with a Dictionary , ( without which I could not attempt it , ) & am continuing Made de Genlis Adele & Theodore ; these , with my little Children s Studies , & my own Letter writing , fill my day very completely , & I generally retire to my Bed Chamber by a little after ten , wch . enables me to rise early in the Morning . I am glad to hear Madl de la Fite is mending , & beg you will aſsure her how concern 'd I have been at hearing of her Illneſs . I hope the Influenza which is said to be so general , will not affect the Queen 's Houſe or any thing belonging to it . I trust to you my dear Miſs Hamilton to make all my Duties & Comps as you know I should wish to do there , & then will do the kindest thing I can by You in concluding this , from Yr . ever faithful & affcte . Servant C Finch Be so good to let the enclosed Letter be sent to Mr Hawkins 's 't is from Mrs Cheveley .
