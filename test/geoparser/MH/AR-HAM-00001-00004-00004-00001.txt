In Uncle Archie s Memoirs Naples Augt . 27 th . 1782 . Your tender heart , My Dear Niece , will I am sure take a part in my present affliction , your poor friend , & the Dear companion of the last 24 years of my life , Alas ! is no more . On Wednesday last Lady H . was siezed with a violent fever of the putrid kind of which she expired on Sunday the 25 th . of Augt . in the 44 year of her age . She wanted nothing but health Lovd Miſs Hamilton -- to have renderd her perfection itself , and yet her patience was such , that it never soured her temper , but one can not see suffering s without taking a share of them , & God knows hers were but too frequent , from almost the hour of our Union -- if ever purity , chastity , humanity , benevolence , charity , occupied a human breast more completely than they did that of my most respectable deceaced Katherine I am much mistaken , inshort she was a perfect Christian , and 1 7 years paſsed in this Corrupt Country Country made not the least impreſsion on her Morals , or Sentiments , unleſs it was to increase her admiration for true Virtue , and to look on Vice with greater abhorrence . Even the late Cardinal Arch Bishop of Naples always quoted her as an Example and wou 'd never visit another Lady at Naples as he thought her the only one that lead a decent and proper life , and as I have been informed , since the death of Cardinal Sersale , he had made a prayer which he said daily that she might at last become a Catholick , tho ' he never spoke spoke to her on the Subject . Thank God she did not suffer much in her last fatal illneſs which affected her brain and made her lethargick -- My only consolation is that death has put a period to her sufferings , and that from the horrid state in which her whole inside was found , she cou 'd never have enjoy 'd a moments ease , had she recoverd from the fever -- She requested to be buried in her family Vault at Slebech in Wales & that when my hour shall come that my remains be laid by her , which shall certainly be be complied with , tho ' my natural sentiments and inclination wou 'd be that my clay shou 'd mix with the Ea r th nearest at hand at The moment of my diſsolution . what a dream is this life ? it seems but yesterday that I was married yet , how many occurrences in the 24 years We have lived together in more Union , than is usual in the marriage State -- it makes me reflect upon a Turkish tale in the Spectator where Mirza 's head is dipped into a pail of Water by a Magician & paſses an imaginary life in the space of time between the plunging & taking it out -- Life is a dream indeed ! may yours my Dr . Niece be a pleasant one -- W : H . via Mantua To The Honourable Miſs Hamilton at St . James 's Palace Windsor Palace Inghilterra London Sir William Hamilton & the death of his wife . 1782 .
