1 st . July 1782 My dear Miſs Hamilton I flatter 'd myself that I shou 'd have had the pleasure of seeing you last week at Kew ; I am now mortified to hear that the Princeſses are to come here no more , but since in this Family people are apt to consider a thing as fix 'd if it happens once or twice , I do not despair . I am myself very far from well , & Mr Fisher 's absence at this time I fe l e l very sensibly . I saw Mrs Tufnell last week , who desird to be rememberd to you , she went to Camp on Thursday with her whole Family , where I mean to pay her a visit if Prince Edward shou 'd go for two or three days to Windsor . I shoud very soon get better if I cou 'd take the Bark but I am prevented by a constant Fever , which affects me dreadfully , altho on the whole I think I am stronger than when I first came into the Country . I see no reason why I shoud not take a Walk on the Terrace at Windsor some Sunday Evening , I have really a Curiosity to do so , and it does not strike me as an improper thing , but I shall stay till I see you , when if you put in a veto I must content myself with Richmond Gardens . I beg respectfully to be remember 'd to Princeſses Elizabeth & Sophia & to Prince Octavius . God bleſs you Adieu & believe me ever most sincerely yrs John Farhill
