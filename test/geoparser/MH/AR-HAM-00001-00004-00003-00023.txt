London . Nov : 10 th : 1807 . I am afraid , my dear Cousin , you must think I have quite forgotten you . Just after I received your last kind letter ( franked by Lord Napier ) I was taken so ill that it required great medical skill , and all my poor Father 's tender care , to save my life . To let you into the truth , this attack was entirely brought on by agitation of mind . You know the unpleasant state of suspense that I have long been in : it has terminated by the discovery that Mr : Holman does not wish , nor , in fact , wou 'd consent , to have me with him , in Dublin , where he has renewed his engagement . He adduces various reasons so little credible , that I have the strongest ground to fear that the true one must be , some other attachment . Rumours to that effect , reached me long ago , but I gave no credit to them . One of the chief motives he alledged being a plan of œconomy , my Father with the utmost kindneſs , offered to make an addition to our income , for the purpose of enabling us to live comfortably together . That proposition being unsuccessful , of course confirms my suspicions . You may easily judge what I have suffered , particularly as the suspense was so protracted . However , I must now , bear with what patience I can , a misfortune not brought on by any fault of mine . I came to London a short time since ; having resolved upon looking out for some little moderate establishment for myself , here ; as the air of Bath never agreed well with my health , and I dislike it as a residence on various other accounts . My Father likes it no better than I do ; so I am not without all hope of his coming to town . Should he , however , not remove , I shall visit him every now and then . I am sure you will be vexed to hear this ill news . I deferred writing , because I was still in the hope that things might take a favourable turn ; but that hope is now extinct . I must quit the subject ; for it is too painful a one for me to dwell upon . I was very sorry for at the account you gave me of poor Mrs : Glover , whose goodneſs of heart made her an object of great regard . I fear to enquire after her , and likewise after Lady Herries , who was afflicted by a similar visitation -- but let me know about them both . I saw Mr : and Mrs : Halsey at Bath , not very long before the death of the former . I regret that he left his money so oddly : besides his Sisters , I could have wished he had left something , if ever so trifling , to his daughter , Mrs : J : Beaver , in addition to her provisions , as a token of remembrance . -- I hope you , Mr : Dickenson , and my Cousin Louisa , have been well since I last heard from you . Pray give my kind love to them . I left my dear Father in tolerably good health , but spirits by no means mended . I do n't think Bath suits him well ; but moving is such an operation at his age , that there is no certainty of his resolving upon it . When you write , direct No : 35 Aldgate High Street , as , wherever I may be , Mrs : Mann will take care of the letter . Has Miſs A : Clarke been with you , and how does she do ? Adieu , my dear Cousin -- I have nothing more to tell you but that I am in a most unpleasant state ; which you must know already , by what I have unfolded . I remain ever your obliged & affecte .
