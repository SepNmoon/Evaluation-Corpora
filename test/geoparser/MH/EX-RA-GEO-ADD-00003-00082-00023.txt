Let me also sieze this opportunity of thanking you for the sweet Verses you sent me , I swallowed every expreſsion with ye . greatest avidity , as I am certain you wld .. not have made use of them unleſs you had felt them from ye . bottom of yr . Soul . I met you this Morning with tears in my eyes which was the only way I could expreſs my thanks , for my heart was ready to burst with sentiments of gratitude & love . Adieu Adieu Adieu toujours chère . I hope I shall find you better tomorrow .
