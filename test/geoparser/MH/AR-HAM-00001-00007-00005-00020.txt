S t . James 's Monday My dear Miſs Hamilton I received yr kind note last night just before my Sister returned , & I find that as usual she had forgot a long Meſsage I sent you by her viz . to ask you whether it wd . be unpleasant to you to see me with Mrs. Dunbar , who had promised to bring me & Sophia to you this Morning , if my Cold wd . allow of it , as I thought that partly from yr . Spirits being agitated & partly from wishing perhaps to be quiet with the Friends you have with you , the last day of yr . Stay it might only be troublesome to you -- however as it has now ended it is as well that She has not put you in Expectation of us , for Mrs. Dunbar has a swelled Face , & the poor Party is quite at an end so as our Coach is otherwise employed for the whole Morning , I must now deny my delay Self the Indulgence it always is to me to see you till I shall want no other Conveyance than my own feet accroſs 2 or 3 rooms . Yrs . sincerely S. Feilding Finch
