11 , S t . James 's Street 27 th . Janry . 1801 . My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 17 th . Inst- having reached Wilton Lodge after my departure , only found me out yesterday . Had I received it when in the Country , I might poſsibly have been induced to have favoured you with a reply , upon an extended Scale ; but , as it was not convenient for You to write to Me , till the very moment You was certain I could not be at home , it is equally inconvenient for Me to waste my precious time in scribbling , when the State requires my most profound meditations . I arrived here on Tuesday last , having left my Rib and Chatterers in perfect health . If I do not alter my plan , which is by no means improbable , I shall remain here till Easter . Whether I may take the trouble of enquiring about You in my way North , is not yet fixed . But my Love , towards your Husband & Louisa , will be a strong inducement to draw me to Leighton House . And , perhaps , the satisfaction of scolding and tormenting You , may be another . I return Sir Wm . Hamilton 's Letter . I certainly do not intend to call on him , and there is little chance of his thinking it worth his while to honour me with a Visit . I am old fashioned , and can not easily reconcile my ideas to the propriety of approving and countenancing the fair Emma . Had he been a Boy of Sixteen , such a step might have been pardonable . But , really at his time of Life , to espouse the Mistreſs of his Nephew , picked up in the Streets , seems such an intolerable peice of folly , and meaneſs , that I quite despise him for it . As he is not my Uncle , I shall therefore plead privilege , and avoid darkening his Doors . Yesterday I dined at Lord Mansfield s and had an expectation , of the possibility of my seeing the fair Emma there . In this , I was mistaken , and my curiosity to behold this prodigy remains ungratified . I hear , our Gracious Queen can not be prevailed on to receive her , and I applaud her for it . Our great Cousins are very civil to me . Invite me to dinner and pretend that they regard me . Why this should be more of late Years , than formerly I know not ; but , I receive all their attentions as if I felt they were due to me , and by doing so , perhaps , may convince them , that they ought to be attentive to Me . The plague is , I can not afford to keep a Carriage , and as You know that Magnificence , is a ruling paſsion amongst our Relatives , they would certainly hold me cheap , for the want of it , did I not , now & then , contrive to appear in a Velvet Coat at the Drawing Room . This , seems to have the effect of keeping up my Dignity amongst them . The Watchman tells me it is time to go to Bed . So Adieu . With my abhorrence to You ; Love to your Husband and Daughter ; and best Compts- to my Countrywoman , I remain ever , My Dear Sister , your faithful Friend & Affecte- Brother Napier P.S .
