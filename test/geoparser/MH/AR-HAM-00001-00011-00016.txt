Stanhope St : Friday Eveng . My Dear Miſs Hamilton All yesterday Evening I expected you -- did you not promise to come to me ? I wonder what Excuse you will make -- You know very well that Sunday & Thursday 's are what I call my Holidays , because I dedicate them to my Children , or such of my Acquaintance only , who will go hand in hand with me in any little Occupation or Amusement that we are employ 'd in -- You were expected in this light ; & Thos : was to have said over his Vieillard , & Julia play 'd at Lottery with Miſs Hamilton -- but She never came , & we were all very much disappointed . -- after Julia was gone to bed , I had a great mind to have sat down & wrote you a Letter ; but as I was very much out of good humour , I thought it better to stay till today , besides which I had a long account to send to Lady Spencer of a Magdalen , whom She left to my Care -- I called upon the Woman where this poor unfortunate Young Creature lodged , to pay her some Money , & to give her a little advice -- but they were out , & I was obliged to appoint them at a particular hour a Day or two after , to pay the said Money -- when I came in , ( feeling rather aukward in accosting this once fine Lady , now reduced to a poor humble Penitent ) I said I called upon you from Ly : S . to pay you some Money which She left for you .. when with the Air of a Bacelli , She said “ Oh ! Ma'am , we were vastly mortified that we “ were out when your Lash : did us the Honor of calling , ” -- just as if I went to leave my Name , & expected She should return my Visit . -- this a little disconcerted me but as I have always made it a rule , if poſsible , not to be influenced prejudiced by outward appearances , I resolved to talk on to her , & find out whether her Sentiments corresponded with her manner -- I never was more affected than by her Conversation , her gratitude to Ly : S . her resolutions of amendment , & total Retirement ; & in short every thing , She said , gives me hopes She is sincere , one thing particularly , which is , her wish for Employment , by way of supporting herself , & paſsing her time , which must otherwise hang heavily -- She said indeed the Evenings were rather dull , which indeed I could easily believe ; the Society consisting of a poor Old Woman as deaf as a Post & a good Notable Woman , who never had a lively Idea in her Life -- I gave her Muslin for her to work for a Frock for Julia -- ( She has already puckered me a pair of Shoes upon Sattin , ) & I desired her to begin & read the Spectators -- when I asked the Old deaf woman whether they ever read in an Evening ; She said , why My Lady -- the Misfortune is , we have nothing , but Godly Books , & they , you know , do n't do so well for constant reading -- I thought the Spectators would be both godly & amusing , & therefore made a point of her beginning them directly . I really am quite interested about her , poor Thing , & I shall be quite happy if She continues , as good as She now promises to be . -- Mr : Burrows has just been here to ask me if I knew the hand writing of the direction of a Letter he recd : lately ; he last Sunday , preached a Sermon , for the Benefit of the Sufferers by Fire in the Parish of St.- Clements & amongst a full Congregation he collected only between 19 & 20 pounds -- a day or two after this , he recd : a Letter , in a very vulgar hand directed to the Rector of S t . - Clements , London -- one would think Madm : said Mr : Burrows , that the Lady thought , I stood always by my Church , in the Strand on purpose to receive my Letters -- but however this Direction found him -- & when he opened his Letter , he fo it contained , Sir I beg the inclosed may be applied to the Use of the Sufferers by Fire in the Strand -- Yr.- humble : Sert : A. Isleworth & what do you think was inclosed , under this strange Direction ? a Hundred pound Bank Note . Mr : Burrows is distreſsed to know who whom it comes from -- as it seems to be a feigned name -- is not this a Curious Anecdote . to be sure Mr : Burrows meets with the most extraordinry occurrences , that ever befell any body ; or at least his particular manner of telling them makes them appear so . Adieu the Bell Man is past by -- so I shall finish this tomorrow -- Miſs Duckworth is just flown up to see me for one Day ; She begs her kind Complime nts to you -- She is quite revived with her Mother s return , & is grown quite fat . & in very good looks . -- I hope you know there is a new Planet , that has been discovered by a poor Industrious German , at Bath ; to the great astonishment of all the great Astronomers . William Herschel dined last Sunday at Greenwich , with Mr : Davies , & came home full of this News . -- Adieu for tonight -- I hope Docr : Maskelyne continues quite well -- I have had a Letter from Dr : Herschel , full of Her Majesty 's gracious goodneſs to her . -- I wish you wanted any Artificial Flowers -- poor Ly.- L. Clayton makes them beautifully , & very Cheap . -- -- I hope you will excuse this horrid blot . -- I have been buying my birth day Gown . Sat : Dr : the Queen is come here to Dinner to Celebrate my birthday -- Miſs Cole Mrs : Carter come in the Evening -- Mrs : Fieldg : sends her Love to you -- pray give mine to Dr : Ly : Ju . Penn -- only think of her being returned to us again so well , & so happy . -- I have only time to say how Affly : I am yours Mrs : Carter To Ly : Charlotte Finch at the Queen 's Lodge Windsor
