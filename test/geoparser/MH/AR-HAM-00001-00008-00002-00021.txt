Sunday decbr . 14 th . 1800 Many Thanks to you my dearest Mrs Dickenson for yr kind & Affectionate Note . & the pretty little bird you sent with it -- I have received a Letter this morning from my beloved Sister , who writes that she has received a Charming Letter from her now dear Dicky -- that she fears she shall be tempted to Answer it too soon . but perhaps it may not happen in this Century -- I meant to trouble you with a line to beg a very great favor of you -- that you will let my Letters come to your House . & that you will be so good to give a Str Scratch over Wing -- Leighton Buzzard . & direct them at the Honble John Peachy 's Nevsells Newsells , Royston -- as soon as I can find a Member . I will write to you my dear friend . for indeed the more we know you both , the more we ( what shall I write ) delight in yr friendship -- Mr Dickenson will have his Present as soon as Harriet can procure it . & I needed not to to put H : in mind of a Purse for Lou who I trust in God will amply recompense the virtuous care you take of her Education , her Principles she inherits -- or she wd be very Unlucky -- I leave this place on Tuesday morning . I am pretty well in Health . but God only knows what how the change from Solitude . to Society , may affect my disorder 'd Spirrits -- I am sure of kindneſs & support , in case of any new trials -- perhaps I have been a great fool in keeping poor Anne , & most likely every body thinks so . but I could not resist such apparent Heartfelt Greif -- United with my own partiality to the Object -- be so good also to suffer my letter directed to Mrs Jones to be sent to yr House . I leave orders with Baily to pay for my letters . kind love . concludes me ever & Affcly yrs DBloſset . Mrs Dickenson Leighton House
