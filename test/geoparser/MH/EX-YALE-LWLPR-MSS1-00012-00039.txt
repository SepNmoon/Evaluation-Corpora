Strawberry hill Oct . 7 th . 1783 . I have just received , Madam , the very obliging favour of your letter & the two melancholy narratives , & do not let paſs a moment without thanking you . Surely , Madam , you had no cause for making an apology . I ought to make one to you for the trouble I have occasioned to you , if your excellent & compaſsionate heart coud think it a trouble to serve the unfortunate , or to oblige Those who respect you Two paſsages in your letter struck me , Madam , & I fear will create a little more exertion of your obliging disposition . You say , the poor Louisa is confined , from neceſsity , to a cell -- If by neceſsity is meant the want of money , I will most gladly contribute towards removing that neceſsity ; but as she found so much humanity , I rather imagine that the deplorable state of her mind neceſsarily occasions her confinement to a Cell destined to Lunatics -- but if the former sense is implied , I beg to know it , & how I may most speedily relieve her . The other paſsage , Madam , is , “ what satisfaction Sr , will it afford you if through your means she is at length restored to her relations & friends ! ” Satisfaction it woud be a high one indeed -- but ah ! Madam , by what means can that felicity fall to my Lot ! If you can point out any method , I woud joyfully pursue it -- tho I doubt your Tenderneſs woud have suggested that method if you had conceived it . One question I will take the liberty to ask you , as by contracting the sphere of Inquiry , one might be led nearer to a discovery . Has Louisa dropped any hint whether she is a Catholic , a Lutheran , or a Calvinist ? Germany is so wide a Field , that without some clue , it woud be a wild search , especially for me who have not a correspondent in all Germany , to commence the pursuit . I am not acquainted with the Austrian Minister , but know a Person not yet in town who coud apply to him ; & I coud as indirectly get queries proposed to other foreign Ministers , & to some of our own in Germany , or to have advertisements conveyed to them . In short , Madam , I woud do any thing in my power , not only from the duty of humanity , & to please you & Miſs More , who have shown such engaging benevolence , but from having too intimate acquaintance with the misfortune of Lunacy , having , besides an instance I will not mention , two families dependent on myself afflicted with that calamity , which I know alas ! is almost hopeleſs ! For poor Louisa , dreadfull as her case is to those who attend to it , she perhaps is no longer sensible to her misery . For her Parents , if still living , They , if they can be discovered , may but have an affliction , probably skinned over by time , opened again , not comforted , by finding their Child in so wretched a State -- That however is not a reason for relaxing Inquiry . We are not to act on hypotheses of our own Imagination , & shun investigation , when positive good may be done , & activity , not speculation & refinement , is demanded of us . We are too apt to numb that activity , & indulge our own lazineſs & want of feeling by specious arguments , which we call common Sense . They may be common Sense , but if it ever is justifiable to good Sense to act romantically , it is by being the Knights errant of the Distreſsed . Louisa shall be my Dulcinea , Madam ; & you shall be the Ducheſs who countenances me ; & who will not like that insolent great Woman make sport with the Visionary whom she encourages to expose himself -- a Character I think it very immoral in Cervantes to have exhibited : there is was no occasion to teach wealth & grandeur to laugh at misfortunes which they ought to pity . I have the honour to be with the truest regard , Madam , your much obliged & most obed . humble Sert HorWalpole
