Thames Ditton 1783 The Day you left London I received a preſsing invitation from Mrs. Walsingham to spend a few days with her -- & she was so obliging to offer to send her Chaise for me -- she wanted me to come on Thursday & stay till Saturday when she told me she would carry me to Mrs. Garrick 's , where you know I was to dine -- I could not comply wth . her request as I had engagements but agree 'd to another proposition she made of my going home with her on Saturday Eveg ( as she too was to be of ye . party at Hampton ) -- & staying till the Wednesday following when I knew I could return to Town wth- Mrs. G—— who was to go there that day -- I spent an agreeable day at Hampton -- our Party consisted of Mr & Mrs. Vesey Mr Pepys , Mr. Walpole , Mrs. Walsingham Miſs Boyle & a Mrs. Flasby who was upon a Visit to Mrs. G—— before we parted Mr. Walpole politely invited me to his Villa & invited ye . Company to meet me on that day week -- upon this Mrs. W . insisted so strongly upon my remaining with her till that time that there was no refusing -- besides there was another powerfull inducement for Mr. W . had desired me to come to Strawberry Hill two hours before dinner tha t he might show me his Pictures & c & c & this I could no t perhaps have managed . had not Mrs. W but by & c you can not imagine how much Hero has made of me since I have been her guest , & how very attentive , good Humourd & polite she has been -- I really have wish 'd for no addition to my pleasure but having you with me -- & we have talk 'd & wish 'd for you every day -- nay many times in ye . da y She is very much pleased with this place , I do not wonder at it after having been in ye Castle wth : all the restraint wch . naturally attends such a situation , for 15 Years -- here she is sole Mistreſs -- & every thing around her being her own property , it interests , her & amuses her . The House is comfortable & chearful -- The Grounds -- but why should I describe ( I I am not clever in describing ) I am very certain you will be much interested to know how we spend our time On Saturday Eveg . I accompanied Hero & Her Daughter -- we came to Thames D : abt . ½ past 8 -- H . shew 'd me the House & we walk 'd in ye . Garden till near ten -- at that hour we sup -- Miſs B . goes to bed at ½ past 9. after Supper Hero was very lively , we talk 'd much of you , and did not retire till 12 . When she politely conducted me to my room . 29 th . June Sunday . I got up at 6 & as soon as I was dreſs 'd I went into ye . Garden -- ye . Morning was heavenly -- I was join 'd by H—— at ½ past 8 , we walk 'd together till 9 when the Bell rings for Breakfast -- at 10 we separated & met again at 11 to go to Church wch . is very near the House it is a very pretty Country Church -- & we had a very decent well behaved congregation -- the Clergyman s appearance was suited to it -- an amiable looking old Man with Silver Locks , he read ye . prayers devoutly , & gave us a good Sermon -- the Stile unaffected and not above the comprehension of his country parishioners -- The little Band of Vocal performers quite excelled in singing the Psalms & they sang an Anthem in a Manner far superior to what I have ever heard in a Village Church . we saunter 'd about ye . Garden , & Mrs. W shew 'd me her domain & c before dinner -- there is a Seat wch . commands a fine View of ye . Thames , wch . is call 'd the Medallion Seat , as Miſs Boyle has modelled a very large one wch . hangs in the Centre Panel -- the Subject is , Hippolytus offering a Chapelet to Diana -- on the side Panels are written these beautiful Lines translated from ye . Hippolytus of Euripedes by Mr. Bryant . To thee , Bright Goddeſs , these fair flowers I bring : A Chapelet woven from th e ' untainted Mead Thy cool sequester 'd haunt ; where never yet Shepherd approach 'd ; where the rude hind ne'er heav 'd Th ' unhallow 'd axe : nor voice , nor sound , is heard Save the low murmuring of the vernal Bee . The day The day-spring from above the dew distils , Genial , & mild , from the pure stream exhal 'd On every fragrant herb , & favorite flower . The original of this Medallion & verses are in the Ionick Temple at Blenheim . The Dinner hour is 3 o'Clock -- and the hours are kept to strictly -- we separated from 3 till 6 , when we drank tea under some trees upon the Terrace wch- has the Thames running under it -- at 7 we got into Hero 's boat & were row 'd for near two hours nothing could be more deligh t ful -- the Eveg was serene and you know how many beautiful Objects there are on the Banks of this River -- when we return 'd the fineneſs of the Weather tempted us to walk & Hero took me round that part of the grounds wch . may be stild ferme Ornée -- we read for when we came in , we read some paſsages in ye . life of ye . Dſs . of Marlbrough -- we sat as late after supper as last night -- Hero pays me a flattering Compliment in sitting up so late , as she told me my conversation kept her up an hour & half beyond her usual time . Monday 30 th . June Hero had the complaisance to take me this Morng to see Hampton Court Palace as she found I had never seen it , we went in ye . Phaeton ( Miſs B . also ) at 11 oClock -- I was agreeably surprised in seeing many fine Pictures for I had understood that ye . King had not left any worth notice -- I was also much better pleased with the Palace than I expected to be for I had been accustom 'd to hear it described ( by ye . R . F . as a melancholy uncomfortable habitation -- I think it on ye . contrary a magnificent and chearful one as ye . terms are light & in fine proportion the situation is certainly low , and the Garden in a bad Taste -- ye . latter might be improved & I think one might spend , that is if one was a King or Queen three Months of the Year very pleasantly at Hampton Court . we came home at 2 oClock that we might be ready to receive Mrs. Garrick & Mrs. Flasby who were to dine here Mrs. W . 's Maid dreſs 'd my hair -- Mrs. W : had desired me either to bring my Maid , or let hers attend me -- I chose the latter as I imagin 'd it would be most agreeable -- she is a Modest pretty Young Woman & dreſses hair remarkably well ( yo . know why I mention this ) Mrs. Garrick entertain 'd us extremely by relating the manner in wch . Lady Burlington brought her up -- the Stile of life she led & c -- this I reserve for you when we meet . We drank tea in ye . M . Seat . Mrs. G . left us at 8 o'Clock & we paſs 'd the remainder of ye Eveg the same as ye . last . Tuesday -- I enjoy 'd ye . Cool of ye . Morng in the Garden with my Book -- there is a retired quiet Seat where I hope to spend some happy hours with you ; -- as it is the one I have chosen , it is to be call 'd mine . H : & Miſs B . came to me at ½ past 8. when Miſs B . read a Chapter in ye . Old & one in ye . New Testament & The Psalms -- this she always does before Breakfast -- she does not read these appointed -- but regularly through . after B . we separate till di d n ner time unleſs we meet accidentally . In the afternoon we went to the Duke of Newcastle s at Oatlands -- saw the fine Grotto -- wch . has been finish 'd abt . 4 years -- it cost 10,000 L it is not well placed , but is extremely beautiful , it consists of four Rooms & a Cold Bath , it is ornamented wth : taste , & is decorated wth . a profusion of beautiful shells & spars , it gives one ye . idea that it is desinge was intended for a Mansion for the Queen of the Fairys . Hero was not able to walk far , so we did not see more of ye . Place -- but we walk 'd a little way in going to ye . Grotto upon the fine Terrace , wch . you must have heard so much celebrated , it looks down upon a Noble piece of Water upwards of a Mile in length wch . ye . D . made at a great expence . We return 'd home about ½ past 8 Hero shew 'd me her Kitchen Garden & c & c she was so obliging as to play on ye . Harpsicord & Organ to me before Supper -- after supper I read to her in Blair s new work of ye . Belles Lettres -- have you seen this Book ? I think I shall like it , as I have comprehended what I have read in it . 5 ) July 2 d . 1783 -- At 11 oClock Miſs B came & ask 'd me if I chose to aſsist at her leſson of Astronomy -- Mrs. W—— gave her this leſson wch . lasted ½ an hour -- as She had an Head ache & could not write & c. she desired me to go into her Dreſsing Room & read to her wch . I did for an hour in Blair . I then left her & when we met at Dinner she was better . Mrs. Garrick came for me before 6 o'Clock -- I went in ye Ferry boat to ye . opposite side of ye . River where she waited for me in ye . Carriage -- the Ferry boat is row 'd by a Woman who has no other apparent distinction of ye . Sex but wearing a single Petycoat , as she has a Mans Hat , Shirt & Jacket -- I ask 'd her how she came to choose this employment -- she told told me she did it for amusement till she was 9 years old -- that an Uncle then obliged her to do it till she was 16 , & since then , neceſsity forced her to continue it -- she appears abt . 40 & a most truly Masculine figure she is -- Phillis , for that is her name , drinks & swears like a Man . I had a very agreeable airing to Town wth . Mrs. G . -- the reason of going to London was a desire I had of seeing Dr . Mr. Glover who was going to Bath & taking leave of my Aunt Warwick who sent me word she wish 'd to see me before she went into ye . Country -- I went to Mrs. Delany as soon as I arrived , for I wanted to see ye . Dſs . D : of Portland before she went to Margate as her G . had preſs 'd me to fix a time for going to Bullstrode in ye . Autumn , I met her at Mrs. D : & have engaged myself to go to her at my return from Northamptonshire . when I came home for the Eveg I found the Glovers -- Veseys -- Jacksons aſsembled to receive me -- they sup 'd with us & I spent an agreeable Eveg . July 3 d - I saw my Aunt Warwick -- had ye . Glovers to dinner & c . Mrs. Garrick came for me at 6 -- when we arrived at Thames Ditton found Mrs. W . just return 'd from Windsor where she had been ye . whole day setting , packing up furnit u re -- she has given up her apartments to his M—— who I dare say is glad to have them again . Hero seem 'd as delighted at my return as if I had been her own daughter -- we spent a pleasant Eveg . together & did not part til 12 oClock July 4 th - I was again invited to ye . Globe leſson , & as I do not understand Astronomy , or have forgotten what I did once learn I made a most contemptible figure , for Hero wld . insist upon my doing some Problems , I wish 'd myself a hundred miles off -- I am detirmind to take some pains in learning it before I again go to T : D : she told me , & That I knew , how quick , how clever , how well inform 'd you were . In the Eveg we went by Water to a Meadow wch . belongs to Hero -- where we sat upon the Hay Cocks & were very Rural -- & sentimental -- repeating Verses -- & c Hero play 'd some of Handle s Leſsons upon ye . Organ before Supper & after , we read ye . Critisms of ye Reviewers upon Blair s new Work -- & c & c . July 5 th - I read & Wrote in ye . Garden till Mrs. W & Miſs B came down , Miſs B . read her Chapters as usual -- they then left me to my employments till B——Breakfast time -- when I recd . your letter wch . had travel 'd into Eſsex after my Sevt . had pd . 6 d postage , so your scheme of Directing to Sr. Wm . at my house did not answer -- ye . post Man insisted upon being Paid , & Mr. Wake happen 'd to call , the Sevt . gave him ye . letter -- Sr. Wm . open 'd it , & Ldy . W . sent it to me aſsuring me he had not read it -- Now do not imagine I had not given orders , for I had , & had also told Sr. Wm . yt . your were to direct your letters to me in that manner . therefore till I can procure franks enclose to Mr. Fraser , or your Maid to whom I suppose you have some . I was much hurt to find by yours that you were again tormented with ye . tooth ach au reste I was well pleased ; I can give you no comfort about my coming down and am not a little disappointed in my hopes upon this subject , for Lady Wake writes me word in ye . letter I have recd . to day that Sr. William is uncertain when he can leave Eſsex & that he thinks he has busineſs for a Month to come -- if I could have known this , I would have gone down with you , for I dread lest ye . uncertainty of Sr. W. W . should at last prevent me from being at Horton when you can be there -- I will however hope for ye . best . at ½ past 1 o'Clock we set out for Mr. Walpole s and got Twickenham at ½ past 2. we had lost half an hour of the two we were to spend in looking over the Pictures . I shall not pretend to tell you all I saw -- for that is impoſsib ly have you ever been at this Villa ? what a collection ! such Pictures -- Miniatures -- Antiques -- relicks -- China & c . & c. what wd . I not give to spend a Month in this House to examine ye . various & valuable curiosities it contains -- I hope however to have opportunities of seeing them as Mr. W—— has politely invited me to come as often as I chose , for I could had only have time to take a transient view . Mr & Mrs. Vesey Mrs. Handcock Mr Pepys Young Burke were ye- Party at Dinner -- I spent an agreeable day & was much delighted with my Visit to Strawberry Hill , we brought Mr. Pepys home with us to Thames Ditton -- Hero had so obligingly requested me to remain wth . her till Monday that I could not refuse -- & indeed I had great pleasure in so doing . Before & after Supper Hero treated us wth . some of her Father s Manuscripts -- Mr. Pepys was very entertaining full of anecdote -- we were so perfectly agreeable that we regretted the neceſsity of going to Bed & did not retire till past 12 -- July 6 th . Sunday Hero came to me before breakfast & strongly preſs 'd me to give her another Week of my company but I excused myself without entering into reasons for she wd . not have thought ym of weight as I had promised to spend a few days at home as my amiable companion Miſs A. Clarke was to leave Town in a few days & I knew she wish 'd to have me at home before we parted for ye . Summer . Hero did not appear displeased but she seem 'd disappointed . Mr Pepys seems to enjoy himself prodigiously & is really an entertaining companion -- he is a great favorite of Hero 's . After Church -- our busineſs was to show him ye . House & Gardens this fill 'd up ye . time till we went to Deſs Dreſs -- In ye . afternoon we went by Water to Mrs. Garrick s at Hampton -- met there Mr . & Mrs. Wilmot Mrs. Morrice & Mrs. Flasby -- Mrs. W.Wilmot looks wretchedly -- he appeard in good spirits -- I quite won his heart by taking notice of his Dog -- we drank tea in Shakespeares Temple and were all very merry till a Shower of Rain made Hero look grave -- some distreſs 's in our return home will make us laugh when we meet to talk it over Typed Charming letter from Thames Ditton to Miſs Gunning or M A Clarke June 29 to July 3 1783
