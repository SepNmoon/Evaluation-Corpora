The Hill Top . March 30 th : 1805 . My dear Cousin , Your kind letter of January 31 st : , would not have remained so long unanswer 'd , but that soon after I received it the point was decided that I should not have an Irish excursion this season at least -- it then became neceſsary for me to prepare to set out for this place in order to get it furnished and myself a little comfortably settled in it , against Mrs Holman 's return . All this prevented my availing myself of your kind invitation to Leighton House -- however , I hope that ce qui est différé n'est pas perdu -- I have been very busy since I came here -- I found that keeping much land in our own hands , would be ruinous considering Mr : Holman 's frequent absence not to mention his total ignorance on the subject of farming -- so I had a tenant to seek , for about 18 acres . I have reserved enough to give us every thing within ourselves , except Wheat ; and , by the aſsistance of a very friendly neighbour , have succeeded in letting the remainder -- and to great advantage . Now we can not be involved by imposition , and I think the place , after the first expences are got over will be a cheap , as well as pleasant , residence , for a part of the year . The House is sufficiently large for our family , and the situation beautiful . -- As to Ireland -- you speak my sentiments so precisely , that I need only say that , to give you my full opinion as to the eligibility of a residence there . I do n't , at present , see any probability of a neceſsity for a permanent stay in that part of the world . Should Mr : Holman chance to re-engage for another season , I would go with him ; because having head-quarters to leave some of my family and luggage in , makes an excursion more practicable ; and I need not tell you who are so good a reckoner of days , in your husband 's absence , that nine months is too long a period for me to remain without him , when it is poſsible to avoid it . I do n't expect him till August -- I am much concerned at your account of Mr : Holman -- I have not seen her for an age ; but remember her with great esteem . A visit to you I should hope , would produce the most favourable effects on her spirits . Pray give my kind regards to her . -- So Miſs A : M : Clarke has seen Mr : Dickenson -- I was in hopes of going to London this Spring , to gratify any curiosity on his subject , and to see a few friends ; but I could not , conveniently , accomplish it . My Father is gone to take a frisk there and has seen the young Roscius ; been to the Opera , -- and , in short , partaken of what amusements are going . I fancy , he is , by this time , thinking of returning to Cheltenham . How is the young Roscius ? and , how goes on her singing ? As to myself , I am totally out of practice ; but intend having my Forte-Piano from Ireland , soon -- and I shall have leisure enough here . I have found an old acquaintance , and a very musical one , in a near neighbour -- Miſs Dickenson -- Mrs : Peploe 's eldest Daughter -- I think we shall be mutually useful , in keeping our music from neglect . Remember me very kindly to Sir George Cornewall ; and tell her I shall be glad when an opportunity offers of renewing my Leſsons to her . Present my best regards , likewise , to Miſs Dickenson . I hope you will write to me , when it suits your convenience . Direct -- The Hill Top -- near Weobley -- Herefordshire . I left Mr : Dickenson well , at Cheltenham -- she is a a most amiable and clever woman , and sincerely attached to you and yours . Great news , you will say , that last information is -- but I think the friendship of estimable people , always a pleasing reflection to dwell upon -- in that light you must take my mention of what you are so well acquainted with . Give my Compliments to Lady Herries , whenever you have an opportunity -- and beleive me , my dear Cousin , very truly yours . Lord Napier . Jane Holman Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire .
