just before leaving for Naples allusion to satisfactory post they leave Mary in I am so incapable of the neglect you accuse me of My Dear Miſs Hamilton that I can not resist thanking you immediately for your kind enquiry -- It is true that I have had the ulcerated Sore throat but I thank God of so gentle a kind that it is quite over . -- it was my full intention to come to you from Kingston , & the Philipps 's proposed great pleasure in visiting you , but the day turn 'd out bad , & my friend was ill which put an end to our scheme , but both Sr Wm . & I are determined to see you before we go which he says will be about Saturday Se'enight -- he takes leave of His Majesty on Wednesday & we both take leave of Their Majesties on Thursday this will be a melancholy ceremony for me for I am thoroughly unwilling to go -- I have often told you that tho ' I am very well with all my Italian acquaintance , I never had any intimacy with any of them , nor ever shall , I feel therefore that I am going to be deprived of the Sweets of Society at a time of life when I have most relish for them , & shall be once more left to my own private resources , which however small I might perhaps satisfy myself with , was I not obliged in a great measure to give myself now up to the hurry of the Great World which I abhor . -- if Hamilton had the same way of think ing I am inclined to think believe we should give up every thing & take care of our own Estate which would be a much more comfortable Scheme than our present situation & I believe would be a more lucrative one -- I am a bad Courtier , & perhaps ought not to say all this to you , but notwithstanding my Spirit of independency , with regard to myself & Sr Wm . I rejoice infinitely in the happy situation we leave you in , under the protection of the best of Queens whom I respect & honour , most sincerely , tho ' I would not be in the family of any Sovereign upon Earth was it in my power -- but all this is between you & I . -- Sr Wm . has been in Wales & is vastly pleas 'd with his reception there -- Several of the Gentlemen wanted him to declare himself Candidate for the next election , but he told them he left all that to them , that he was willing to represent them if they desired it but wish 'd it to be their own act -- I find their wishes to have him a re almost universal , they expreſs 'd great impatience at our being so long abroad , & are very desirous we should live among them -- in short it was a struggle who should receive him best -- the Estate is in a prosperous way , & it w a i s a reall pleasure to me to find my Father s memory w a i s still dear to all the People of the Country -- I tell you this knowing you would be curious about his transactions there -- I have just receiv 'd a Letter from Ly Stormont begging us in the Strongest terms to come to them at Paris , & you will believe how sorry I am that Sr Wm . will not be prevaild upon she says her little boy grows fat & lively , she desires her Compts . to you -- Poor Monsr . D'Ajincourt is I believe a little disapointed , but it really intollerable to have had him tagging after us in our Journey , tho , ( for a Frenchman ) he is really one of the best I ever met with , tho ' in general I do n't think them bearable before they are compleat Sixty , as were my old Knights of Malta when I visited that Island -- some of which however were old enough to talk to me of Lewis ye 14th- as if he had reign 'd Yesterday -- in my airing to day I calld on Mrs Hamilton ; but could not go in because of the smell of paint , & I give you notice she will make herself sick with it -- unleſs she can be prevaild upon to sleep out of the house -- I must now take my leave of you -- but be aſsured we will not go without coming to see you for I am with the t Sincere friendship Yr Most Affectionate Aunt CHamilton you must put on Mourning for a Week for ye Dſs of Queensbury Friday -- 18 th - July 1777
