Buxton 9 th . Decbr 1790 My ever Dear Mary -- I have no doubt but I shall find relief from Bathing -- I am certainly better this morning , the pains are moved & I feel myself quite comfortable except from a few twinges in my Ancles which frighten me -- the pain is mounted from the lowest part of the Back into my Shoulders and most probably will vanish in a few days -- Our Louisa behaves like an Angel . She is a charming Creature -- As I wished to perspire after Bathing , She slept with Grandpapa ; as soon as it was light I was vastly amused by a whispering Conversation between the two great friends -- We hope that you will come tomorrow -- & pray come soon . I thought of havg Louisa s Hair cut but I will defer it till you come , & I think you had better undergo that Operation at the same time -- I am sorry to tell you a piece of bad news , which I know will distreſs you very much -- The newspaper came about 5 Minutes ago , which gives an Acct- of the sudden death of the Dſs of Athol -- She was taken ill on the road from Scotland and died at 4 oClock on Sunday afternoon at the Duke s House in Hanover Square -- Pray bring tomorrow another flannel Waistcoat for me -- Mr. D . talkg of E : this morning said nobody knew her so well as he did -- he adverted to her lying in the bed which he laught at & said she had contracted a habit like her late Aunt M of appea ring to be ill to attract peoples attention , but that he saw thrō it all -- he hinted at something which I could not get him to explain , as if she had marked out somebody that would do -- He always speaks differently of Sarah & thinks she has made a resolution never to marry -- Louisa says “ tell Chevr . I am here and he must come & see me when Mamma & Aunts come & he must see the fine Houses thats all & if he pleases must give me Talian leſsion when he comes ” -- My Father is riding out -- Pray give my Compts . a mio fratello e a mia sorella & credere che io sono Molto Affettuosamente Vostro felici e Vostro fedele Marito JD—— 13,14 kiſses from Louisa Dickenson
