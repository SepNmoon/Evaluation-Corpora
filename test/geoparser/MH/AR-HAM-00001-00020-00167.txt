4 , Suffolk Street Charing Cro≈øs 11 th . March 1802 . My Dear Sister , I read as much of your Letter to Lady Lovett as concerned Louisa , and rejoiced at it . As for the rest of the Clishmaclaver , I could not be bothered with it . Having generously bestowed a Wafer & some Spittle upon the despatch , it was consigned , according to Order , to the twopenny Post . There will be no War . The King looks Cool , and Well . I am doing nothing ; but purpose going to sleep immediately , when I trust my Dreams will not be disturbed with the horrid Idea , of hearing the Clack , of your Tongue . Love to all with You . Ever Your faithful & affectionate Brother Napier London , Twelfth March 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Post Office Northampton Napier .
