My Dear friends . As I love you all dearly , I have long wished to hear from you ; and my imediate answering your kind letter , will convince you how much I was gratify 'd at my arrival in Town , to find a letter from you , if my Eyes were as good as my heart is towards you all ; My Scrawls would much oftener be brought to you ; altho you would not think them worth the pos tage . I live so much out of the world , That you could better inform me what paſses in London then I could ; and Therefore you must not expect any news from Thence . of Hampton , nothing but lamentation could come from my Pen ; for from the Month of may , to this time , were nothing Then winter Month ; and all my fine fruit was distroy 'd -- I hope the Summer will begin at Christmas , that I may at least put on my new made up muslin gowns before they will become out of fashion , in my next , I will give you an account how I spend my time in my retirement ; now I can not , for want of time -- God bleſs you all ! -- Miſs More is well at Cowslip . Ever Yours M : Garrick . Adelphi Novr . the 23 : 1799 To John Dickenson Dickenson Esqr . Leighton Buſsard Bedfordshire
