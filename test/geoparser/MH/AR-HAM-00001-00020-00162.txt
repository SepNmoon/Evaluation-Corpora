Wilton Lodge 9 th . Novr . 1801 . My Dear Sister , As you seem to be conscience checked , I hasten to relieve You , and to repeat the Absolution formerly given You on the subject of Epistolising . Therefore , be it known to You , that I bear You no ill will , hatred , or Malice whatever ; but , that You and Yours , are , as you ever have been , high in my gracious favour and esteem , and will continue to enjoy the same happy distinction , whether You write to me , or not . I hope , that this ample , categorical , and sincere Declaration will set your Mind at rest on the subject . Not having a penny in my Purse , nor any likely to come into it , I have very prudently determined to let the Lords squabble about the Peace , without personally aſsisting at their deliberations . But , that I may have a finger in Pye , I have sent my Proxy to the Magnanimous , Magnificent , and Courtly Baron of Cathcart , ( who expreſses the great sense he entertains of the honour & confidence , I have reposed in him , in the most amiable Style you can poſsibly imagine . This being the case , I can not have the satisfaction of beating up your Quarters , at this time , and I am determined never to say to You , or to Archy Cathcart , when , I mean to see You , as I have had my plans so constantly deranged . So you must content yourself with the hopes , that the Chapter of Accidents may lead me to Leighton Buzzard , when you least expect me . We have had a most delightful Summer , and plentiful Crops of Grain , Potatoes & c , which has reduced our Markets to reasonable terms . This plenty , followed by Peace , seems to have made everybody here , very happy . The joy of the Neighbouring Village was testified by illuminations & c. If we can but keep Frenchmen , Frenchwomen , & French Principles out of this Country , and keep our own Men & Women out of France , all may go well . But , although I love , and approve of Peace , yet , I shall feel much sorrow , when the Alien Bill is repealed . The French Princes are to return this Month to Edinburgh , which will be a very dull residence for them , and will not ( I think ) be any advantage to the Society there . I always was a great Antigallican , and grow more and more so , every day . My Seven home Brats have been laid up with the Blibes , Water Jags , or Chicken pox , whichever You please to call it . My eldest Girl is still confined to her Room . As this is not a dangerous disorder , it has not affected their Spirits , but their bodies are perfect Leopards , ( not Lepers ) . A cargo of them go out this forenoon , for the first time since their confinement , the idea of which seems to transport them mightily . Maria joins me in Love & best wishes to You , Mr. Dickenson , & the fair Louisa . Ever My Dear Sister Yours very Affectionately Napier Is my Countrywoman married , or dead , for you dont mention her ?
