Norbury Park , July 10 th . I can by no means bear to wait so long as till next Winter , before I entreat my Dear Miſs Hamilton 's pardon for my apparent neglect of all her kindneſs during the laſt month of my stay in Town : but as She knew the uneasineſs which dampt all my pleaſure even in the charming party at Hampton , I hope when she hears that the fatal termination of that suspence , made me wish for nothing but to haſten into the Country , to recruit both my Health & Spirits , she will forgive my silence , omiſsions , & various misdemeanours , & receive next Winter , with her wonted good humour , & “ agreeable smiles , ” her obliged humble servant F : Burney If Mrs. Vesey is still in Town , may I beg you to present my best Respects to her ? And may I entreat you to have the goodneſs to tell both Her & Mr . & Mrs. Pepys , when you see them , that nothing but a string of the moſt uncomfortable circumstances should have prevented my waiting upon them before I left Town ? Miſs Burney July 1784
