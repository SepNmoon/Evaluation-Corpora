16 th Jan : 1786 Why do I not hear from you my dear Friend ? have you not received my letter , which I wrote the day after yours reached , as I did at Horton about the beginning of October immediatly on the receipt of yours . I imagine you at Courteen hall , as you mentioned being to go there immediatly -- How is Lady Wake in Health and spirits ? How are you yourself my dear Friend ? this severe Weather does not agree with you I fear -- yet we have had within this 10 Days some very mild & charming , I was at the Park , and walked out for hours without a Hat -- 'you dont know how I have expected a letter by every days Post from you , ' or you would before now have let me hear from you -- you say that you are well convinced that every thing that concerns you , interests me , so it does indeed most truly , how can you then keep me in ignorance of your health your affairs & your proceedings -- Indeed my dear I love you with as much warmth & sincerity as I ever did , & never , never will these sentiments change in my Breast , tho ' change of situation & a variety of circumstances may have put us leſs in the way of each other -- I think all my Friends forget me -- They write from France so seldom & then so uncomfortably that I had almost as lief not hear at all -- tho ' they are perfectly well , & my Sister likes the place & Society extremely -- I am in a low , uncomfortable state of mind , not miserable , but not happy -- ant ' that the worst disposition one can be in ? I feel heavy , stupid , indiff erent I should like never to leave my room or open my lips -- & should certainly give way to this vis inertia ( this word is only for you -- ) if my Friends did not come to take me out by main force -- I go out certainly every day -- Foley House is my home & when I am not asked out to Dinner , I dine there -- sometimes the society amuses me and I my spirits are raised , but these are only false ones , intoxication , & when I wake , I find myself more dejected than before -- you will say , occupy yourself , pursue some study , voila le mal that I have tried their remedy & it fails -- tho ' I do not pursue a study , my mind & pen are constantly occupied -- I have all my Father s Busineſs to transact , & never write leſs than 4 or 5 letters in a Day -- then by way of recreation I am learning to play on the Harpsicord -- yet all this does not do -- There are few People in Town -- Ly Louisa Stuart I see sometimes -- she is now as happy as are all the family ; on Lord Macartney s return , with the honor & glory of having spent 4 years in India , & returning home with only one servant , & very little addition to his income & that only from having saved part of his appointments -- Ly Lucy & Mr Digby are in Town , he has been confined almost ever since he came by a fit of the Gout , so that I have had very little comfort from him -- he looks like Death , and is more out of spirits & melancholy than you can imagine -- the Argylls are at Ealing where I paſsed some Days about XmaſsChristmass -- it is the D. of Malbro 's House which the D—— has bought & it seems to be a pretty place -- Pſs Elisabeth is recovering very fast -- she had been out once when Lady Harcourt wrote to me yesterday , & P. Augustus is much better -- Mrs Harcourt is gone abroad for the Winter -- she left this a month ago , and was detained above 3 Weeks at Dover -- adieu my dear Friend I leave you to dreſs for Mrs Wals : with whom I dine is but just come to Town -- I have seen nothin g of her the whole summer & fear I am quite out of favor -- I think of , & miſs you at dinner -- think of me & write to me very soon , a comfortable letter -- remember me kindly to Mr Dickenson & Ly Wake adieu your affec : CMG Mrs Dickenson at Courteen hall Northamton
