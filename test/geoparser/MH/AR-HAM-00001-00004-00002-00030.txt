My dear Sir Mrs. Mann arrived here yesterday morning , & we were not long in settling our busineſs ; she had every thing arranged in so clear a manner & so corresponding with your account that not a single difficulty occurrd ; it was to be expected upon such an event great expence must be incurrd , but by her good management considerable abuses were prevented . Mr Holman immediately after the death of his his Wife call 'd for her keys , & in the presence of Mrs. Mann took out of her drawers £100 belong ing to me , & £30 in a draft belonging to me him which he said he wou 'd mention to me tho ' he did not say a word upon the subject , his laying hands upon the £100 was certainly improper , as I charged him with none of Mrs. Holman 's expences . Since Mrs. Mann s arrival I received a very impertinent letter from him , complaining that he was much disappointed in his late meeting with me , in which he expected in addition to what I had paid him I would have made him a gift to ameliorate his circumstances . As I by no means intend to comply with his ill founded expectations , I will engage in no further correspondence with him , upon which I expect in future every instance of hostility against me in his power . I take the opportunity of returning you by Mrs. Mann a Deed , which has been long in my poſseſsion . I have made her a present of £200 as a testimony of my regard for her , & of her fidelity & attachment to my late dear daughter I beg to be remember 'd to Mrs . & Miss Dickenson & to aſure you that I am My dear Sir , Your most oliged & faithful humble Servant Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St Bath July 20 th . 1810 .
