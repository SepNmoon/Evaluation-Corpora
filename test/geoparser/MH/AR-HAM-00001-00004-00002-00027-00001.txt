My dear Sir , In my extreme distreſs on the afflicting information I have just now received it is impoſsible to communicate to you the instructions that are requisite upon the occasion , my mind is so totally distracted that I can enter upon one subject only which can not be deferr 'd & that is respecting my dear daughter 's funeral . I approve of Mr. Elliott 's being employ 'd with caution not to run into unneceſsary expence , I wish it to be in the Parish of Paddington where I have already employd him three times , in all which he acquitted himself with great propriety , & I am sure he will be anxious to preserve a continuance of my regard . With respect to my conduct towards Mr. Holman as there can be no further intercourse between us I by no means desire to act with rancour . I can add no more at present being call 'd upon to write a line of grateful acknowledgements to the worthy Mrs. Mann all other objects tho ' deferr 'd , shall not be neglected . Ever yours most faithfully Frederick Hamilton Bath June 12 th . 1810 . Pray supply Mrs. Mann without reserve with what money she may want upon this occasion . John Dickenson Esqr . N o .49 Welbeck Street London Mr F Hamilton on the death of his Daughter Mrs. Holman
