Bath Sept . 12 th . 1785 My Dearest Mrs. Dickenson Your kind letter & Mr Dickenson 's has made us very happy , it found my Dearest Father better , after having been very ill & alarmingly so , you will , I fear , before you receive this letter have been made unhappy on his account , as my Dear Miſs A. C . will have wrote you word of his illneſs , which has made my Mother & myself very miserable , Friday Yesterday & to day he is thank God quite well , he eat for the first time yesterday a very good dinner & with a relish , to day we have a haunch of Venison , & before I seal my letter will let you know how he plays his part . When we first arrived at Bath , which is a month to day we were very much disappointed , for by his letters to us we expected to have him found him pretty well , we came in the Chariot & our own horses , & arrived here a day sooner than he expected , his joy & surprize at seeing us , after an absense of two months quite overcame him , he eat no dinner , & I found it was as much as he could do to prevent his sheding tears , he look 'd wan , though not thin , he had never eat his dinner with an appetite , for near four months ; this day fortnight we thought change of air would be of service to him & he said we should take a little tour : We therefore went ; & our first stage was to Wells which is about nineteen miles from Bath , which is a very pretty , Clean & small Town , the Cathedral is a very fine one , & kept in the most perfect repair & order , there is a clock in it which was brought & presev 'd from the ruins of Glaſsonberry Abbey ; it shows the motion of the Sun moon & planets , at the Top are s ix men on horseback , & by touching a spring they Gallop round the moon , it is reckon 'd a very fine peice of workmanship & is about seven hundred years old , my father said he thought the men on horseback was very proper for a puppet show , but he could not approve of their being in so solemn a place as a Cathedral . The Bishop 's palace is a very dismal place , it is surrounded by a high stone wall & a moat all round it , the deanary is a very handsome house . There are a great number of Gentleman 's houses in Wells & some very Capital ones , particularly Mr. Tudway 's who is their present member . After dinner we went to a place call 'd Wookey hole , which is two miles from Wells , it is a Subteraneous place , & runs for three hundred yards und a mountain , the way to it for near a quater of a mile is very dangerous , it is along a path in some places not a foot wide , & on one side a precipice , of at leat thirty feet , at the bottom of which is a very rapid river which iſsues from the hole ; my Father would go with us , & you can better feel the horror I felt & my Dear mother least his foot should slip than I discribe it , we arrived at the Top wth . our guide & William , my Father was afraid to go into the hole on account of the damp & therefore return 'd , my Mother yr . hum ble . Sert . William & our guide had Candles , it is a wonderful place , the water as it drops from the rocks which hung over our heads petrifies , as I saw the spar which is very fine we went about half way to a place they Call , the Witch es Chaldron & Furnace , it is in a bason of Water two feet deep & about fourteen wide in the middle is the Chaldron which is in the shape of a vase form 'd by the petrifaction , at one end is the Furnace ; their are other petrifactions , one is the old Witch herself ( as they tell you ) you can really make out a face very tolerably , their is another which forms a very good lion 's head , it was very Slippery , & when we came out & got safe down , we were very happy to see my Father setting down a peice of timber , he said if he had had an Idea of its being so dangerous , he would not for the World have let us gone ; we slept that night at Wells , & the next day went to Bridgewater which is a very ugly dirty Town , we the went to Bristol , it is a very beautiful Country all the way from B.water to Bristol , we were unlucky in the weather therefore lost great part of the prospect , when we came to within four miles of Bristol it clear 'd up , & I can not discribe the beauty of the prospect , the City of Bristol , Clifton the hot wells & the river runing between the rocks , was quite inchanting ; Bristol is a very populous but dirty City ; we spent one very pleasant day with Mr & Mrs. Weare , where we met Mr . & Mrs. Gardiner & her two fine children . Monday Morn : My Dear Father eat a very good dinner yesterday therefore my dear friend at Taxal need not make themselves uneasy about him as I thank God he is now in a much better way of a perfect recovery than ever . When we first came to this place there was in the house besides my Father a Mr & Mrs Blunt , who paſs 'd through Bath in their way to Lime in Dorcetshire not meaning to stay above a day or two ; but they liked my Father so well that they made their stay a month , a fortnight of the time we enjoy 'd their very amiable society ; they were Roman Catholic 's , he was many years older than Her , a very sweet temper 'd man , & Mrs. Blunt was pretty , about the height of your Mary Glover ; but so Chearful , good natur 'd & of such a natural lively disposition , that she has made an interest in all our hearts ; their is one thing I must tell my Dearest Mrs. Dickenson , the letter you wrote to my Father after your marriage , struck him so much , that he show 'd it Mr & Mrs : Blunt , & he has told me several times that your very affectionate style of writing brought tears into Mr. Blunt s eyes , I have that very letter Now in my poſseſsion & shall for ever keep it , yes believe me you do , must , & will for ever live in the affectionate remembrance of your friends , our happineſs is compleat on your account , but we never doubted it your being the very happy woman you are ; pray tell your worthy Father & sisters , that my Father & mother look forward With pleasure to the knowing them , & if my Dearest Father is in health , I have not the least doubt but a journey to Taxal will make him very happy ; We can not think of a journey to Buxton , since it is very uncertain how long we shall stay at Bath ; As I am here & was very ill with my old complaints for near a month ; I am trying the waters & have found very great benefit from them , we shall certainly stay this month out ; & in our return home shall pay a visit to Dr : & Mrs. Warton . Our Amiable society is broke as Mr & Mrs. Blunt have left us , there is at present a very amiable young woman in the house , who is obliged to leave us to morrow ; We have a General Sherrard who came the week before us , he is reported to be a man of great personal courage , I can not say more for his agreeableneſs , he is a very good- naturd , very tall , & next to a degree to of being very ugly , he is brother to the Earl of Harborough ; Mrs. Prattenton the Miſstreſs of the house , is I believe by birth a gentlewoman , she is very pleasing rather pretty in her face & person & equally so in her manners , she is universally belov 'd by all who know her . I am quite delighted with Bath & should like very much to give up our Town house & live here in the Winter ; sin ce you are gone , their is no one I should regret leaving but my Dear Anna Maria , & even her we should hope to tempt & come & be wth .. us ; My Father has many old friends here , who are settled , particularly Mr. Melmoth , who was his schoolfellow & General Parsloe , he is a most polite charming man , his age is no leſs than eighty seven , how you would like him , I wish you could see him he went a tour with his daughter & grand daughter this summer , of five hundred miles & is return 'd all the better for it ; he is settled at Bath which is says is the nursery for old age , their is likewise a Mr & Mrs. Smith , I have not yet seen Mr Hamilton , he is at present at The Honble . Charles Hamilton 's , my Father show 'd him yr . letter likewise . My Father & mother unite their kindest & best love to you & our dear Ly Archibald , & pray remember us most respectfully to Painshills Hamilton & Lord Lansdown , I can aſsure you from their very kind behaviour to our dear & ever dear Mr Dickenson we have already a great affection for them . I had not been here a fortnight , when one day as I was walking in the pump room with my Mother , we were taken for sisters , last Friday I was told that a gentleman said he thought I could not be leſs than twenty six , so you see I am taken to be an old woman maid . -- Adieu my Dearest Mr Dickenson Senr .. & be aſsur 'd of the unalterable Affection of your Miſs Dickensons & sincere friend -- Miranda I think this is a reasonable long letter I have tried & tried in vain for a frank , tell Mrs : Dickenson I think letter was very saucy , though we very sincerely thank him for it , & as he writes so very pleasantly beg he will add some lines in the letter you write , he boasts of preserving his dignity , his letter made us smile , I declare yrs made us almost cry for joy -- -- -- M.
