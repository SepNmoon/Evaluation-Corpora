My dearest dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , Accept ye . overflowings of a truely grateful heart . yr . dear note this Morning has instilled more real pleasure and balsam into my Soul than I can requite throughout ye rest of my life . My mind was in so disturbed and flurried a condition that I could not settle myself to any thing , but you have given me some comfort to day . I beseech you to continue , yes , let me say to extend yr . favorable intentions of not quitting at present to those of never quitting unleſs for ye reasons I aſsigned then you will make me perfectly happy , till th at time I never can be entirely so , I also entreat of you to continue in yr.e same favorable sentiments in regard to yr . friendſhip towards me , I flatter myself you never will find it misplaced . With regard to ye . Bracelet , I do not look upon it as any present , but as a mere exchange , for as you are to give me a ring of yr . own hair which will be of more value in my eyes than ye . most brilliant Jewel , it will only be ye . mere exchange of yr . Ring for my Bracelet . I did not send you ye Letters to day as I had intended , thinking that you might not know what do with them just at that moment , and that they might embarraſs you . I beg you will send me a Motto by my Meſsenger . Adieu Adieu , Adieu , dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , friend , believe me when I say I esteem yr . friendship beyond any other earthly happineſs , & that I shall ever be unto my life 's end yr . sincerely affectionate Brother & Friend . P.S . I send you a Letter case full of Letters I think those are only worth yr reading which are ye Letters from my Parents & ye . answers to them , But read them all if you have a Mind . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu . My messenger goes to Town on Friday therefore I ask for yr . answer to concerning ye Motto : I do not know any thing about our going to W—— however if you hear any thing about our going or about yrself which interests me full as much as myself I beg you will inform me immediately . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu .
