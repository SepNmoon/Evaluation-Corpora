5 , Charles Street Westmr= 5 th . March 1799 . My Dear Sister , As you threaten to invade the Capital , to secure good terms for myself , I obey your commands by instantly acknowledging the receipt of your Letter , although the doing so is matter of much inconvenience to me , my Pen being hardly fit to write with , and my time not affording me leisure enough to mend it . Why did you not send me the Route to your House , instead of advice how to travel ? True it is , that with all poſsible assurance , I have travelled , ( and persist in doing so ) to the House of Lords in a Hackney Coach . But , I have not yet sufficiently subdued my Pride , so as to submit to jumble into the Country in the Stage Coach . As to your Mail Coaches , that Respect which I owe to the safety of my bones prevents my thinking of such an Attempt . My stay here will probably be till towards the latter end of April . My intention then was ( if poſsible ) to look at You , and Archy Cathcart , in my way North . Having stupidly forgot to bring my Road Book with me , I know not how far this plan would have been practicable . If you come here , one difficulty will be removed . If you do not , I must endeavour to fulfil my intentions . Not that I care about You , for we shall certainly quarrel . But , your Guid Mon & your Bairn are deserving of my regard . As I have not been bilious lately , I need not call in Clarges Street for M rs - Castor ( Oil , I suppose , you mean ) . Really , it cost me trouble to recollect who you could poſsibly wish me to wait on , as I never knew anybody of that Name , in my Life . After much puzzling , and examining the word with a magnifying Glaſs , I suspect , your intention was to have written Carter . It is so long since I left School , that my Greek has left me . I dare not , therefore , encounter any of your Blue Stocking Aſsociates . If I think of it , your Meſsage shall be delivered to Old Cis , and a scold to Lady Clavering . Adieu , for I must go to a Committee for dividing waste Grounds in the Parish of Molesworth . Say everything kind for Me , to your Lord & Master , Your Child , & my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister Your Affece . Brother Napier . London , Fifth March 1799 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds . Napier
