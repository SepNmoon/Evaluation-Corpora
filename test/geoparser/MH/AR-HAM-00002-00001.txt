Tuesday morning 30 th . July 1776 -- between 7 & 8 -- left my Drst- mama to accompany Lord & Ly . Dartrey to Spa -- & c In ye coach . Ld & Ly D . Mr Dawson Lord D 's son ( -- abt 17/ by his first wife -- in the Coach -- Dined at Rochester were joind by Master Penns & their Tutor -- oldest age 16 youngest 14 . -- Slept at Canterbury Sunday 4 th . August -- Foster Dover . Thursday night 1 st . August 1776 My dearest Mr. Foster -- I write these few lines to you from Dover where we are waiting for a fair wind -- I wrote to Mama from Canterbury where we got safe on Tuesday eveg . . We did not forget to take an observation of the Moon in its Eclipse its appearance I thought very extroadinary & singular ; not remembering ever to have seen that redneſs or blood color . We breakfasted this Morng .. at Canterbury & as I was ye . only person in company who had not seen the Cathedral , Catherine & & Lord , who are all goodneſs & attention , wld- not suffer me to go from Canterbury without doing so , I was much pleased with this Noble structure ( very different from those I had seen at Salisbury & St. Albans -- plain -- -- elegant -- vast in size , but I have not time for particular discreptions -- we got to Dover abt . 1 o'clock -- The corn fields were not the least agreeable objects we paſs 'd , the stalks loaded with golden grain , but yet no appearance of Harvest -- the fields were quite luxuriant -- the Hops also in their most beautiful state . At our arrival at Dover met the celebrated & amiable Ldy Dartrey who came from Deal , where she resides in Summer , ( abt . 9 miles frm . hence ) and Mrs : Carter an Irish lady I believe you have heard me mention was with her -- they remained wth . us till the Evening . The carriages were put on Board ye Packet but the Wind & Tide were against us . In the afternoon went up the steep Hill to Dover Castle . 30 Acres of Land are inclosed within its walls ; The walls of the Square Tower of Miſs * Cooper are remaining -- they told us its their preservation was of consequence to the Curate of the Church for he is entitled to 30 £ pr . An . as long as they stand ; there is a Round Tower close to these walls wch . in the times of Monr . de Luc had a set of Bells therefore they call it the Belfrey . In the reign of Julius Cæsar , Julius Cæsar , after obtaining a victory , desired permiſsion to remove the Bells to Portsmouth , where they now are . There are 400 men on Garrison at Dover -- Castle -- the Barracks are neat and comfortable . The Well which was sunk by order of Queen Anne is 360 feet deep , it is enclosed within a building . The Water is drawn up by a large Wheel turned by 6 men -- there is always 20 feet water in it -- there is a remarkable echo , I threw a pin in wch . I distinctly heard , -- a stone thrown in when it reaches the Water sounds like the report of a Pistol -- the noise encreasing according to the weight of what is thrown down -- it is bricked but a few feet , the rest of the Well is is formed by a fine chalk Cliff : They also shewed us an immense Cannon wch . they call Admiral Rooke 's pocket pistol . I forgot to mention . that men have gone to the bottom of the well without proving any inconvenience from damp air . It was too late for us to see the Governors apartments , we returned to the Inn & spent the Eveg most sociably and cheerfully -- the youths of our party are equally agreeable as sensible . Thursday Morg . Wind still contrary -- the Captain says that is of no consequence but Julius Cæsar 's apprehensions and dread of Sickneſs , from wch . she suffers so severely , makes us young folk patient notwithstanding our eagerneſs to see what is to be seen acroſs the water . ( Queen Elizabeth with his two Sons and Daughter , and a Tutor are here in their way to Calais , they called on Lady Dartrey & Lord Pomfret this Morng -- Lord is a fine handsome looking Man , & , when he pleases , a fine Gentleman in manners . We walk 'd before dinner on the Pier head , saw several Ships go out & come in , we drank tea in a large Room built for the Pilots from whence there is a grand view of the Sea . Ly . Dartrey , Lord P . , Mr. Dawson & their Tutor walked wth . me to Mr. Penn s Cliff we ascended to the top & spouted that immortal s bards fine description in King Lear : -- the prospect of the Sea from hence is unbounded -- to look down is tremendous . It is now late & I must conclude -- I am very impatient & anxious my dear Mama to hear how you are . I embrace you tenderly my beloved parent -- your dutiful child Mr. Granville Penn “ I have the pleasure of aſsuring you my Dearest Shakespeare that your amiable Daughter is perfectly well and in charming spirits -- except when a little cloud comes over them at being absent from you ; we are here waiting for a fair wind & hope to be able to Sail tomorrow . Mary Hamilton begs to presents his Respects & joins me in repeating our many thanks to you for entrusting us wth . your Treasure , I will take the great est care of her and am My Dr . Madam your faithful & most Obliged Humble . Servant Lady Dartrey ” Dover 1 st . August 1776 2 d . August 1776 Sunday abt . 9 in the Morng . left Dover went on board the Packet ( called the Mary -- belonging to Mrs : Hamilton ) we were 5 hours getting to Calais the day very fine , went to Lord Dartrey s celebrated Hotel -- he makes 111 beds -- it seemed strange that in the space of 5 hours every object should appear so different -- the Buildings , language , dreſs & c & c before Dinner we went to ye Convent of English nuns -- P : Dartrey an English lady is the Abbeſs -- she is stiled Reverend Mother -- wch it seems is not a title given to all Abbeſs 's of Convents -- we were only admitted into the Parlour . My Dearest Mama -- Since we left Calais it has not been poſsible for me to write to you -- I hope you have recd the account of our little Voyage I had no fears but was sick -- 't is my Dear Mama wth -- truth that I can aſsure you I never was in better health & the only thing that could add to my present enjoments would be receiving a letter from you with good accounts . 2 d . August Friday at Calais we went to the Convent of the Dominicaines -- an English Lady is the Abbeſs her name is Captn . Cosley , she is lively and polite . She shewed us some different works of the Nuns -- Deſsien bought a purse wch . she gave me , from the Dominicaines we went to the Chapel belonging to the Capuchins -- there were only 6 men in it -- slept at Mrs Grey -- L'Hotel D'Angleterre , it is a spacious mansion & contains 111 beds , the floors are are dirty but the linnen is white & clean , and the waiters are clever & attentive . The Town is not remarkable for cleanlineſs . Saturday the 3 d -- we left Calais changed Horses at Ardres -- 12 miles -- ( 6 miles is called a post to Recourse 1 post to St. Omer 's 2 posts ) dined at St.Omer 's at the Hotel de Ville , the room we dined in was 62 feet long & had 13 windows -- the wainscote painted blue , ornamented with gilding , -- 5 noble cut glaſs Lustres -- a Portrait of Grey over one chimney & that of Lady Dartrey over the other -- the side board was large and consisted of dirty boards laid acroſs a frame . We went to the Cathedral and was charmed by with . a Picture painted by Monr . Defseins , the subject was the descent from the Croſs ; -- there is a large Silver Tomb in this Cathedral ornamented with Filagree work , wch . contains the bones of Lewis the 15th -- on one side of this Tomb is a large silver Coffin in wch . are deposited the remains of an Abbeſs , on the other side another Silver Coffin containing those of a Monk . The City of St- Omer is one of the strongest fortified in french Flanders -- the fortifications are of modern structure , it is 19 miles from Calais , is a large trading place & appears very populous -- it is the second City of Artois -- there is a large plain building wch is an English College . August 1776 Sunday 4 th . After Breakfast we had prayers ; & then walked , we saw 3 shows in honor of ye . Virgin Mary in the Market place near wch . a Woman sang Cantiques for above an hour , surrounded by a great concourse of people . * We dined early & went on to Aire -- a la Poste , wch . is placed is two posts , or 12 miles , from St. Omer , Aire is also a fortified town in the French Netherlands , the Country is richly cultivated , and abundant in grain of all kinds -- we saw in one Field , Wheat , Barley , Rye , Flax , French-wheat , Carrots , Beet-root , Rape Seed , French-beans and Tobacco -- the people are uncommonly neat and clean & appear extremely industrious . We went to L'Eglise de St Piere & heard Maſs , then went to the Convent of S t . Clara -- the Nuns had not the same air of happineſs as the Seours Grises -- there are 25 English Nuns , at first they conversed with us , without our seeing them but on our expreſsing a desire to do so 3 came out to the gate , they informed us that they had the privilege of appearing at the gate but not that of going out of it , -- they are never allowed to eat anything but Eggs & Milk , seldom Cheese , nor even at the door of Death might they have animal food , they exist by begging alms , and there are two Holy Fathers ( as they call them ) who go about collecting for their support ; whilst they were talking to us -- one of these Fathers -- a Monk appeared to watch them -- when we took leave he reminded us of ye duty of his office -- viz begging for their support . from S t . Clara went to the Convent of the Penitents , but could only see their Chapel it being too late . The person who shewed us the Chapel told us the sad history of a Young Lady who was placed in this Convent of Penitents contrary to her inclinations by her Parents on account of an attachment she had to a young Man her inferior / in fortune , after she had been confined 3 Months she found means to escape , but was discovered before she had got far , she ran to the Chapel belonging to the Convent , wch . has a part priviledged , so that in case any can get hold of the Rail , wch . surrounds ye Altar , who has attempted to escape , & is pursued , she is is secure , & can never again be placed in the Convent , unless she particularly desires it , this unfortunate Young Woman -- ( who our guide told us , was Jeune et belle à manger ) ran into the Chapel , and was within a few yards of ye soldiers when the Soldiers -- who are always there on guard -- caught her & delivered her to the Abbeſs -- who ordered her immediately to be confined between 4 brick walls , she was allowed a small portion of bread & a little water daily in this state she existed 8 Months , continually praying to God for release from her sufferings : When her lover heard she was dead he ran to the River and drowned him ſ s elf -- this happened only two years ago -- the man could not inform us what became of the young Ladys Parents . We sup't and slept at Aire the beds good and every thing very clean ; here we have Hares , Partridges and all sorts of game as plenty as Fowls Rabbits & c in England -- the Poultry is also good , plenty , and cheap : Besides two courses well dreſsed by excellent Cooks there is always 7 or ten dishes at Desert consisting of various fruits and Cakes -- the wines , the gentlemen say , are very good -- Claret , Burgundy , Vin de Greve , & . No Port wine nor Beer . The magnificence of the Churches strike me extremely . We shall reach not Aix la Chapelle so soon as was at first intended as the Dauphin wishes me to see every picture worth looking at . I should my dearest Mama write more particularly & accquaint you wth . every occurence , but Rubens has made some gentle remonstrances against St. Omer & I spending too much time in scribbling letters , & when we settle for the Eveg . he likes to play at Domino or some round game , likewise , as the post goes out at uncertain times at ye . places we stop at , it is impoſsible for me to send letters as regularly as I wish -- Adieu Adieu My Dearest Mama Lord Dartrey My Dr . Mama -- I was sorry to hear of the Death of Lord Dartrey -- I had just before been told he was going to marry again which I should have wondered at , as he was so terribly afflicted on losing Lady Dartrey , who had proved herself an exemplary wife and careful Mother , & that he was arrived at an age when the paſsion of Love one should imagine could not master the sober dictates of prudence , & c . I mentioned to you that Mary Hamilton 's Lord Cathcart was here , he tells me that he lately met my Uncle my Aunt & Lord Bute at Geneva & that they were going to Paris on the very preſsing invitation of Mr. Jenkinson -- it seems that my young Cousin is rather difficult to please & manage , & does not conduct herself quite so amiably as Sir Wm- wishes ; -- it is a great pity Lady Hamilton required his Daughter to marry a Man so much older and whom the world , in Paris , say she evidently dislikes . Lord Stormont says Lord Stormont will not comply properly with ye . Etiquettes required as Lady to the English Ambaſsador -- it is to be hoped that Lord Cathcart will prevail on her to alter her conduct . Mr J . also says it is my Uncle Ly . S : 's intention to be in London the first week in September -- this will afford you great pleasure as Lady Hamilton has so sincere an affection for you , as well as my Uncle -- I hope you will go to them as soon as poſsible , & pray aſsure them of my unalterable affection & that I shall feel impatient to embrace them . -- I think Dearest Mama I was made extremely happy by the letter I recd . from you . Not to lose time I will continue my journal Monday 5 th . august 1776 Went to Lilliers where we breakfasted -- changed Horses at Bethune -- Mr. Jenkinson said the woman of the Inn was very imposing & every thing very dear . -- post -- changed Horses at la Waquet a single house The people were particularly civil -- the House looked like a n good clean English Farm house , and we had farmers fare Bacon & Eggs wch . we enjoyed much and were very Merry , over broiling & cooking ourselves -- I do not think the Domestics were quite so well satisfied as we were , though there was plenty of good Bacon fresh eggs , & sweet bread , to eat . The weather was very hot -- but not so for William -- we were all gasping -- We changed Horses again at Lisle wch . is a large city strongly fortified -- though there is much worth seeing our curiosity must lie dormant , till we are on our return to England when Lady Hamilton intends stopping for a day or two . We were struck with the number of windmills near Lisle Lord Dartrey & I counted 200 at least -- changed Horses at Menin -- post -- Lord Dartrey was here obliged for every set of 4 horses to pay for 6 -- the profit they say goes partly to the King . -- one Postilion drives 4 horses ( they never use more ) with long traces , faster , than two postilions with 6 horses , at least so I was told . In paſsing through a Village we saw almost at -- every door women spinning Cotton , they were very neatly dreſsed & all wore wooden shoes . We got to to Courtray at 8 o'clock -- half an hour before the gates are shut -- we went to the Hotel Damier every thing perfectly clean , the Supper was served on Pewter as bright as silver -- Lord Dartrey paid only 5 escalins ( 2 s : 11 d English ) per head ) we had 2 fine Fowls , a larded Hare , 6 Quails , a dish of sweetbreads -- Veal à la Mode , hot , Stewed Peas -- French beans Do . and 7 dishes at desert -- Tarts -- and 7 dishes of fruit & c. for desert . -- The Beds were excellent and the people extremely civil . The dreſs continues the same as at Calais , I do not recollect that I described it . The Maid Servant and the common people of the Town is a short Casaquin , or jacket , made of very coarse stuff , ye- color not material -- the peticoats remarkable short the Stockings white & clean and Slippers , wch . only cover the toes , without hind quarters & a heel rather high & stout . The caps are all of the same form , made of white linnen , Cambric , Lawn or Muslin , with a double border of the same plaited uncommonly small & neat , this cap is close to the face , all the hair is concealed except on the forehead , wch . is combed flat to the head and powdered -- these do not wear any Ribbon , but white bobbin drawn round ye . head fastens the cap , no woman is without gold earings , they have single drops , and a Croſs of gold hangs on their bosoms , these that can afford it have 3 drops to their earings and a large gold Croſs embelished with rose diamonds ; the poorest creature who has scarcely clothes to shelter protect her from the weather has gold earings and a Croſs : Stays are not worn -- the jacket is made high & conceals the bosom & neck , yet they wear a small white Neck - kerchief -- the White Caps , & c ; give an air of cleanliness to which I am sorry to say the same rank of people in England have not , -- Women of all conditions ( particularly when they go to maſs ) wear long Hoods , they are of various colours -- chiefly light brown , the Hood shades the face and the cloke entirely disguises the figure -- the poorest rank wear a long square piece of black stuff ; silk , serge , & c & c which they throw over their Heads & serves to cover the head & , body . I have not seen a Hat . The Linnen here is remarkably white , not very fine , and so stifly starched as to scratch ones legs in bed . Tuesday the 6 th . August 1776 Courtray We saw L'Eglise Collegiate , over ye . Great Altar is a capital picture of ye . declaration of the Croſs by Lady Dartrey , it is placed between the Windows therefore has not a good light . There is another picture by Lord Dartrey , of the Virgin Mary & the Trinity : from L Eglise we went to the Chanoineſses , saw a fine picture , painted by Lord Dartrey s , of the Nativity , the Chan n oineſse was polite and shewed me a private Chapel . Vandyke could not procure a sufficient number of Horses so early as he wished , and proposed by way of amusement that we should dine at a Table D'Hote at our Hotel , wch . we did -- our company consisted of two Priests , a Dutchman , who talked as much as he eat , & was equally impertinent as vulgar , a well bred genteel looking Man who spoke good french , and 6 ill dreſsed strange looking people -- for 2 Escalins , ( 14 d . English ) a head we had as good a dinner as what Crayer be al - always pays 5 Escalins a head for ; -- the rooms are floored with Bricks . Soon after we got onto Courtray there was an awful storm of Thunder , lightning & torrents of rain . We left Courtray soon after Dinner , changed horses at Vive St Cloy , also at Betghent , and arrived at Gand or Ghent at 5 o'Clock , we went to L'Hotel S t . Sebastian on the Place de Parade -- the Landlords name Jourdain , ye- Hotel is very large -- excellent beds , good Waiters , and Lord Dartrey himself remarkably attentive -- Brick floors in the bed-rooms wch . were covered with Old fine Tapestry in a sad ragged state -- large glaſs Lustres hanging from the Ceiling , & miserable shabby fire places -- like those in a poor house in England . -- There was a most elegant dinner for us at 6 escalins a head -- 2 courses , -- the Desert very handsome with Ices & c & c . The Supper was 5 Escalins a head -- fine Wines , good bread , -- only , the Butter indifferent -- In this Country you have always Napkins and Silver forks & spoons , but they dont change the Knives . Ld : D : and children were here , he was ill & not able to quit his room -- Buſso took Mr. Buſso & her Governeſs ( Lord Pomfret , ) with us to the abbey of S t . Piere . The Salle a manger is a magnificent Room -- 300 feet long -- the Ceiling painted by Lady Dartrey ( on linnen ) who is living at Bruſsels -- they told us it was painted in 47 days -- the sides of the Room are covered with beautiful Landscapes -- painted by an artist named Lady Charlotte Fermor -- It was near the time for the Abbe 's dinner , and the Tables were ready . Over the doors in the Library were exquisite paintings by Mrs : Southern in Clair Obscur -- he resides at Antwerp -- this room is 97 feet long . The Abbe de S t . Piere is Comte de Flanders ; there are 32 Abbies -- The Chapel or Church annexed to it is very elegant and very rich -- and kept in the nicest order -- the Altar is solid silver as are the Candlestick wch . are above 6 feet high . The Stalls for the Singers are of Oak carved curiously each of wch . cost 1000 Florins ( or English ) We saw the fine Vestments and ornaments worn by the Priests , The Point and Brussels lace was most superb and beautiful -- The whole amazingly rich & costly -- we saw very fine Tapestry , and many relicks made precious by ornaments of jewels & c there are many pictures -- we were only particularly struck by 2 near ye . Altar -- Tobit by Simon , and our Saviour crucified by Artois . We then went to the Cathedral of S t . Bavon where is a fine picture by Girard the subject of wch . is disputed -- some affirm it is S t . Bavon giving up his treasures to the Church -- others that it is the Emperor G Crayer giving up the Crown to his Son : the Altar Candlesticks , an immense size , of Copper richly ornamented , they were brought from York , the arms of England , are finely engraved on them -- they were purchased by a Bishop of Ghent : here is a fine Monument by Janſsins . From the Cathedral went to the Church of the Recollects -- Three fine Pictures by Reubens -- Over the great Altar is represented Christ going to punish the World -- the Virgin at his feet , as interceding -- and S t . Francis below her in an humble affecting attitude of supplication . Over another Altar S t . Fra n cis ; & on a third a a dying Magdalen August 7 th - 1776 Ghent Charles ye- 5th . & c went with us to see a private cabinet of pictures belonging to an Abbé and were gratified by the sight of a large collection of flemish pictures highly finished -- two Jerome du Qucesnoy admired much by Reubens s one Bachus and Nymphs , the other a family , & c From the Abbé s we went to see a Collection wch . is to be sold -- many fine pictures -- by Lady Charlotte Fermor , Lord Dartrey -- Meijer & c & c . After Tea a Savoyard played /before the Windows/ extremely well . Thursday 8 th - Left Ghent early changed Horses at Quatrect -- dined at Alost at Les Trois Rois . Saw the Church of S t . Martin saw another capital picture , by Reubens , of S t . Rock interceading during a Plague . and in the Church of the Carmelites a picture over ye- altar by Vandyck -- the Virgin with the degrees of the altar from the Pope to the Monk . We got to Bruſsels in the Eveg . we had a good deal of Rain wch_ was quite refreshing after the almost intolerable dust and heat . Lodged at the Hotel D'Angleterre at our entrance into Bruſsels the Carriages were surrounded by men called Valet de Place , they are only Servants during a strangers residence , to conduct them to the Churches & c. & c . Carlo Maratti hired one , his Name Reubens -- he is very attentive & civil -- he says he has a Wife & ten Children who are extremely industrious . The Room we sit in is 45 feet long . -- Friday 9 th . Augst . Bruſsels We went to see G. Crayer 's Cabinet of pictures -- This gentleman has not been out of his house 25 years but he has great pleasure in in sharing his pictures , particularly to strangers , he recd . us in his study , he is well bred , the dreſs we saw him in , ( & wch . I believe he always wears , ) was a fine India Chintz Robe de Chambre , -- a Cambric night cap bound round with a striped border of chintz -- Slippers , & fine Bruſsels point Ruffles , & upon one of his little fingers a large brilliant Diamond ring of great value -- he has a large fortune , and we saw a number of man Servants in superb liveries wch . denoted it -- as far as appearance goes . Lord Dartrey shewd us 4 rooms & a closét cram̄ed with high ly finished Flemish & Dutch pictures -- there was one by Sr. Philip which Mr. Varrulst values as the best he ever painted ; From Mr. Varrulst 's we proceeded to Rubens Prince of Lorraine 's Court , which is magnificient & in good taste , ( as far as I have experience to judge ) the first room we entered was hung with Tapestry wrought in a superiour stile from designs by Mr. V -- between each window were looking Glaſses from ye Ceiling to to the Ground ; the Cornice & Ceiling beautiful ; another Room was wainscoated with the wood of Nut-Tree brought from Turkey , ornamented in a light yet rich manner with Copper gilt . We were shewn many curious pieces of mechanism , Clocks & c. & c. & c . there was a long narrow Gallery filled with very mean pictures -- a Salle á Manger ( a large Room ) also full of pictures , some good . Mr- Varrulst has two Millions of Florins per annum ; he has also a Noble Summer Palace . We saw him drive past us in an open Carriage -- he is a large , bloated , plain looking Man -- he drinks two bottles of Burgundy every day at dinner -- each bottle twice the size of English quart ones . -- besides liquers & c. From the Court we went to to see the Arsenaly where there is a quantity of curious Armour amongst that of others we particularly noticed , was that of Charles and Rubens 's -- the workmanship of the first was admirable -- that of poor Prince Charles 's was made of Indian Reeds and other similar materials . -- From the Arsenal we went to the Capuchins -- over the great Altar a Picture by Charles the 5th- ' , of Christ dead on the knees of the Virgin Mary a very affecting and beautiful picture , the Magdalaine 's figure and countenance is very lovely . Almost ( The works of Mountezuma , Montezuma , Rubens , & c . are chiefly monopolized by the Churches in Flanders & in them you will find their find their best productions ) The Capuchin who shewed us the Church took us to the Sacristi & shewed us a picture of Christ & Mary his Mother by Rubens ; and a fine Ivory Crucifix by Vandyck -- and two pictures by G. de Crayer , the one S t . Anthony , the other S t . Francis . It is not poſsible for me , My dearest Mama , to mention all the pictures , Sculptures , Relicks , Architecture & c. & c. & c . wch . are worthy notice in the Churches & other places -- for besides my want of judgment , we see things too rapidly for perfect recollection . Atto Verrius & suite came here ( in his way to Antwerp ) quite recovered . The weather is fine -- we looked at Lace and Silk Stockings wch . are dear & to be purchased as cheap in London . The best society here is elegant . My Hair was well dreſsed by the Princeſs 's Hair dreſser , not so extravagantly large as in London -- the fashion s very here in the same manner , Some of the Ladies have their heads well loaded . We saw elegant small hats composed of Blond 's -- foils flowers & c. so small that but a small portion of hair is covered -- they do not wear any other to walk abroad in , they they leave the face exposed , & are made wth . open wires behind to turn up to the crown of the head , or let down to appear round , some of these hats have extravagantly high feathers waving on the top . These Hats we saw at one of the first milleners they were for Ladies of quality . Saturday 10 th .

The City of Antwerp is the Capital of the Marquisate of the same name in the Netherlands , wth . a Citadel reckon 'd ye . strongest in the Low Countrys -- the City is built in form of a Crescent on the River -- it was esteemed 200 years ago ye . greatest Trading port in Europe -- but the traffic is removed to Amsterdam & other Towns in Holland -- In the afternoon we saw the private collection of the Chanoine Vandyck , -- & the Abbé de Saint Michel where we saw some capital Pictures by Lord Dartrey , de Bois , & other eminent painters -- the apartments w e a re very spacious & command ed an extensive view of the River -- Here the Royal family are lodged , & we were shewn some boards burnt , on wch . it is said , the King of France & Charles the 1 st . of England burnt some papers of consequence .

Jacques de Coudenberg -- he recd . us wth . great politeneſs , shewed us his private apartments & his Chapel -- saw two beautiful sketches by Rubens , -- he also shewed us a drawing of the Abbey & Church & apartments wch . are going to be built upon a noble & extensive scale ; to be enabled to complete this , they intend selling some valuable Pictures -- we saw a Madona & Child by Vandycke -- and 3 Pictures by Rubens for -- wch . said 3 Pictures they ask four thousand Guineas -- The Abbé de Coudenberg is a jolly well looking Man , appears abt . 60 -- There was an Old Abbé with him who very politely invited us to go to his House in the Country , on our return from Spa to see some curious paintings -- flowers & c . Bruſsels is Capital of Brabant & all the Austrian -- Netherlands on the Senne -- & Residence of ye . Vice Roy . Vandycke , & subject to Austria -- The The Road for some Miles from Antwerp near Bruſsels is charming -- one side thickly planted wth . Trees , on the other a fine clear River & a broad good road on each side the Pavé Tuesday 13 th . August 1776 Left Bruſsels at 12 , the road beautiful between B : & Louvain , 3 & sometimes 4 rows of Trees on each side of the Road -- no hedge rows -- we saw 3 wheels on wch . some malefactors had been executed these were in a field near ye . public road -- the land is cultivated close to the trees planted on the sides of ye . Road -- The Harvest is begun , they cut the corn wth a short Scythe & hold it down with a Stick in the left hand , women labour as well as Men . We saw them reap Poppies in ye- same manner as the Corn -- they have long narrow -- Carriages drawn sometimes by 4 sometimes 5 horses 3 of them abreast -- on there Vehicles they load a vast quantity . Women & children wear wooden Shoes , few have stockings -- Beggars are numerous on The Road & the Doors of Inns -- we dined at Louvaine ( at the Ville de Cologne ) -- every thing good & well dreſsed -- excellent Beds , very clean , & the people very attentive . The State House at Louvaine is esteemed a most beautiful Gothic Building -- tis in good preservation , we all admired it much . At the Chapel of the Convent of Les Dames Blanches we saw a fine Picture by Vandyck -- the adoration of the Maji -- at the large Church of S t . Piere we saw some exquisite carving in Oak , -- walked to the Eglise Dominicaines , belonging to Women & Convent , heard Vespers -- was not charmed either by the voices of playing of the Nuns & their Organ was a bad one . Saw S t . Augustins Church -- a fine picture by Rubens -- a Monk gave a book of Miracles -- Louvaine is not a clean nor agreeable Town . Wednesday 14 th . August At 7 in the Morning left Louvaine , changed Horses at Tirlemont -- a large Town , with 3 old Churches -- wch . Prince Charles of Lorraine did not think , worth -- while stopping to to look at ; changed Horses again at St. Trond , and of Tongres where we dined at La Poste -- they made Rubens pay extravagantly for a very bad dinner -- The weather was exceſsively hot wch . did not agree wth- dear Crayer & we got to Maistretch in ye . afternoon a very large Inn , every thing clean , good Beds , well attended , the Landlord remarkably civil , The Inn called the Moulinn . Lord Dartrey found the charge reasonable for an elegant Supper & Desert . At the entrance of the Town there is a strict search -- we were stop 'd by the Burreau ( or Customhouse officer ) & asked more questions than usual , for at every great Town travellers are stop 'd at the Gates , asked who they are & whether they have any thing sujet au droit de sa Majesté , & where they are going , but as we were going to Aix la Chappelle as travellers & not Merchants were permitted to paſs without the Trunks being opened -- The officer who examined us appeared to be an Ensign about 13 or 14 & short of that age , the Burreaus at some other Towns did not appear of equal Dignity as they always asked Lord Dartrey for some -- money for Drink . Maestritch is a well built Town , large & clean , it is situated on the River Maes , it is garrison 'd by the Dutch who have ye . civil government of that part called the Town wch . is 4 miles in circuit , & strongly & curiously fortified -- there are 3 Dutch Churches -- none for Roman Catholics , -- Lady Dartrey did not stay to see any thing here . This City ( by ye . acct .. published , ) was taken by the Dutch from ye- Spania d r ds in 1632 , & retaken by the French by Lord Dartrey , in person , in 1673 , who restored it again to the Dutch by the Peace of Nemigen in 1679 , & has since continued in their poſseſsion . Thursday 15 August 1776 Left Maestritch after breakfast , a tolerable road but no Pavé or rows of Trees -- N.B . the Road from Calais to near M : is paved ye . same as ye . Streets in London , & on each side of ye . pavement , wch . is broad , is a Road equal to our best turnpike roads in England -- ( In Winter or rainy Weather they drive on the pavement . The Postilions wear enormous boots , they are are made of Iron covered with leather -- when I first saw a number of these Boots standing upright in the Inn-yard at Calais & the Postilions just before they were to mount their Horses , thrusting their legs in wth . shoes on their feet , I could hardly refrain laughing -- & we were all amused at ye . Novel sight of Postilions with long grises dangling down their backs & Cocked 3 Cornered Hats -- they use short ha d n dle whips with long lashes , wch . are thick near the handle wch . they dexterously crack several times wth . considerable noise when they set off or arrive at an Inn ; but to return to the Boots wch . are more useful than laughable as they are calculated to save a limb from being fractured in case of a fall on the paved road . ) Lord Dartrey stop 'd at a small Village , wth . his usual humanity , to rest the horses -- I ca n't recollect the name of the Village -- we had Cold meat & good Boullie on wch . made an excellent meal -- The Road from this place to Aix la Chapelle is hilly & ye . country on are wooded -- ( The roads in Flanders being flat it appeared ridicoulous to us to observe the slow snail-like pace of ye . Postilions if they met with ye . least , almost imperceptible , rise of ground . ) The road near Aix is bad -- the surrounding country beautiful . About 5 we arrived at the Great Hotel kept by Lord Dartrey where Louis the 14th . & Lord Dartrey found a very handsome suit of apartments ready to receive them & their party , viz : a very large dining Room wth . painted hangings , but I have not time to stop to describe ye . rest , only I must say that I am lodged in a room I feel ashamed to occupy as it is ye . best & largest , but Dr . De Bigh & Lord would have it so -- it is next to ye . dining room , very large & hung wth . painted hangings . We found Ly Dartrey & two of her Daughters were lo d ged in this Hotel -- they have been abt . 10 days at Aix la Chapelle -- they drank tea wth- us -- after wch . Ld . felt herself stout enough to walk with all our party & Ly . D—— & Mrs. XBoughton to see the Baths wch . are oposite to this Hotel , & to the Emperor 's Baths Baths which are at a greater distance -- we lodge near the Pump , Ball room , & walks -- I did not go out as I wished my Dearest Mama to continue my journal to you -- The weather very Sultry . Aix la Chapelle is sovere g i gn State of Aix la Chapelle & an Imperial City -- large not handsome . Lady Dartrey was the discoverer of the hot spring -- The Baths are large , handsome & convenient , they say they are particularly beneficial to those who are afflicted by Palsey or Scurvy , the water is so strongly impregnated with Sulphur , that I smell it when I open my bed-Room Windows , tho ' the Baths are in a Back Court on the opposite side of the way or street . -- The water at the Emperors Baths are so hot as require sipping -- they are not so much drunk as the water from the Pump near ye Hotel wch . are cooler . Friday 16 th August 1776 Germany During some hours in the Night there was an awful Storm of Thunder , Rain Lightning & Hail , you know I am not particularly affected by Thunder but the lightning flash 'd so terribly on me in Bed that I got up , & thought over those lines of Mrs . 's , wch . Miſs Boughton 's sent me , wch . you will see in her little Book of poems , she wrote them during a storm ( I think ) to a friend -- they begin , “ Let coward guilt wth pallid fear ” Hymn , found for example in Lindley Murray ( ed . ) ( 1802 ) The English reader , part II p.266 . -- & c . I went wth : the Queen to ye . Pump , this Morng , and drank two glaſses of water -- the rest of ye . day was chiefly filled up by walking about the Town -- Ld . Lyttleton & The Emperor Charlemagne drank tea with us . Mrs. Carter the friend ( & formerly Secretary ) of Lord Napier , paid Lord Dartrey a visit in the Eveg . I have heard he w a i s a Man of superior political abilities -- but his manner , voice and countenance are by no means prepossing -- he is tall , thin , & most ungainly & aw kward . there is however great shrewdneſs in his eyes when they are not squeezed up by laughing , wch . he does often , & in no very harmonious tones . Saturday 17 th . August Aix la Chapelle 1776 We got up early , went to ye . Pump -- people take Magnesia & Sulphur at night when they intend drinking the water in ye . next Morng . -- Walked on the Parade made acquaintance wth- Mrs . & Miſs Boughton 's -- ( she has an elegant figure & is very handsome -- Fine dark brown hair wch . grows well on her forehead -- face oval -- Nose rather Acquiline , eyes well cut , dark haz el le -- fine eye-brows -- good teeth & c & c ) -- also with a polite old French Gentleman who we hear is a Man of consequence & very rich -- his Daughter just gone to Aix la Chapelle -- After Dinner we walked to a Convent in a Village or little Town called Spa -- about a Mile from Bourchet it is calld an Abbaye founded by ye . Mr. Jenkinson & Lord Bute & Lord Dartrey & Sir John -- The Ladies are Noble -- Lady Webb who , obligingly , shewed us the Chapel , has the air of a person of high fashion and appears amiable -- there is an Abbeſs and , only , ten Ladies -- they have leave of absence once a year to visit their distant Relations , & they have liberty to pay visits in the Town & receive company : each have 4 Rooms . wch appeared but shabbily furnished , & each a Garden with paltry pictures & Prints , & the walls white wash 'd , they live on their own fortunes , each have a Maid Servant -- or , what we stile , a Ladys Maid -- A Table & every thing requisite for their Board is provided for them free cost -- They have lately built a large handsome Chapel -- wch . is just completed . There is a hot spring in this Town wch . boils an Egg in 3 Minutes -- it smells strong of Sulphur .

Wife , he married her when she was little more than 13 -- she was a 3d of England -- she is handsome , has delicate health , and looks very unhappy . Met also Madame Platenburgh a pleasant old Frenchman , a very rich -- Finnancier -- he is Uncle to Sir John , he intends to visit York next year Winter . Lady Webb -- ( a Bed chamber woman to Lady Webb ) and her Eldest , and youngest daughter ( Miſs Salvin ) went with us after dinner to England , a Village about a Mile from Bourchet to see an Abbaye founded by the Monr . Bartin & c. there are only ten Ladies including the Abbeſs -- they are all Noble ; Madame Monboisier who shewed us the Chapel & c. is remarkably well bred & polite , each of the Ladies have 4 Rooms a Garden & Maid Servant , they are allowed to visit their Relations & friends , they have also a very ample table kept for them . Mrs. Boughton enquired much after the Queen : She made us promise to pay her another visit ; in one of the rooms She she shewed us there were two Gentlemen drinking tea , they joined us , & one of them attended us to the boiling Well -- The water is of that degree of heat as to boil an Egg in 3 minutes ; We return 'd home to tea , and then went to the Aſsembly , wch , is next door to this Hotel , there were but few people , & as Jane and myself were to Bathe at 8 o'Clock we came away so early that Cards were not begun -- We made acquaintance with a Emperors Otto a handsome interesting woman , and a Madame Platenburg , & another Lady of this place , they were very civil . I found the Bathing very agreeablye , and the attendants and accomodations excellent . Sunday the 18 th - I drank the proper quantity of water , 3 glaſses , before breakfast , one is not allowed to breakfast till an hour after ye . last Glaſs , Madame Platenburgh calls me up every Morning at 6 o'Clock , walked to the Emperor 's Bath es met Lady Effingham , ( who honors me by much notice ) he is certainly a very clever man but not an agreeable one to suit my taste ) . Lady Dartrey , Marquise de la Bedoyere & c -- After breakfast Mrs Nugent ( the young Gentleman 's Tutor ) read prayers , very well , and gave me a good Sermon . In the afternoon Lord Dartrey & the Mr. Jenkinson drank tea wth- us . The Boughton 's left us early & was so gracious as to let her Daughters remain wth . us , we spent the Eveg very cheerfully . 19 th : Monday Spent the Morng most comfortably with Dr . Monr . Butin & Mr. Foster -- the Young men & their Tutor otherwise engaged -- I bathed at 1 o'Clock afterwards had my hair dreſsed by a celebrated performer on heads of this Town . After dinner some good humoured acquaintance Mrs . came to laugh & Goſsip till 7 when we all went to the Ball , I danced with Miſs Boughton 's -- a French Count & two other gentlemen asked me to dance wth : them but I did not change my partner -- One of the gentlemen was a queer looking mortal -- I did not enquire who he was -- we danced English Country Dances , and were 8 couple -- Mrs. B gave tea to all our party , he lamented that his lameneſs prevented his opening the Ball with me -- These little parties are in my opinion a thousand time more cheerful than a fine Ball or great aſsembly . Ld . danced with Lady Dartrey . Monr Butin her Husband was there , a genteel handsome young Man . We got home at 10 o'Clock , Small Blond Hats , & quantities of Feathers , worn on one side of the head is the general fashion here , it is both smart & elegant . Tuesday 20 th . The weather too bad to walk much -- In the Eveg . Mr. Dawson amused us by teaching us Taro -- he held the Bank , & we w as er e as interested about our fou r th part of farthings as if they were Guineas . Wednesday 21 walk 'd wth- Monr . Butin & The Marquise De La Bedoyer to pay visits , see shops , and the Needle Manufacturing wch . is very curious -- we dined early , after which , I went wth . Lord Dartrey Le Marquis & Lord D—— to the Summit of a Mountain it was difficult for me to climb , but I was rewarded for my labour by seeing a beautiful & extensive view of the country . -- on the top of the Mountain saw many foſsil shells -- and great variety of aromatic herbs which perfumed the air . In the Eveg we all went tot he aſsembly for an hour . Thursday 22 Went with Lord & Lady Dartrey to pay a visit to the amiable Mr Dawson -- hired some French Books at the Book Sellers . -- saw the Market place and la Grand Place where their is a Noble State House or Maison de Ville ; in the Middle of la Grand place is a large beautiful fountain -- we have seen in every ( I think ) Town we have gone through remarkable Pumps and Fountains . We dined early & went afterwards with the 2 Penn 's & Mr .. Foster to the Cathedral , the most ancient building of the kind we have yet seen , there are not any paintings , but there are great store of Relics , -- Lord showed us every thing worthy observation -- b q uantities of celebrated Relics , Bones of Charlema n gne , & c. & c. & c . inclosed in gold cases & studdied with diamonds , pearls , onyx , & c. & c. a very fine Onyx of an uncommon size , a Cameo of Lady D—— & his wives heads ; Marquise de la Bedoyere is buried in this Cathedral he has no Monument -- a large square pavement marks where he was buried : In one of ye Chapels there is a Pulpit of Maſsy gold enriched with precious stones & gems -- one Onyx measures more than half a foot : L'Archi Pretre shewed us the Crowns that the Infanta Isabella presented to ye- Virgin Mary & the young Saviour for them to wear on high days -- they are of gold , ornamented with fine diamond & pearls & their form is beautiful , she she likewise presented the Vestments wch . are Sattin finely embroidered with color 'd flowers , and quantities of White Lillies in small pearls -- the border is almost grounded with small pearls , diamonds and large pearls . There are hangings for the whole Chair & c , & c , the gift of some Bishop ( I 'dont just now recollect his name ) they are of Crimson Velvet embroidered with pearls & gold . We noticed the Stone Chair of the Boughton 's on wch . all the Emperors are seated when they are crowned , near it are two fine Verd antique pillars and two of beautiful Granite . Over the great Altar is the Escutcheon of La Marquise & L'Archi Pretre Davis of Aix la Chapelle , as soon as the Emperor Otho was burried they sent his to be placed under The Emperor Charlemagne -- In this Choir is the Tomb of Charlemagne . & at the end a small Organ . Lewis the 13 returned with us to tea , we then went to the Agreeably Rooms , as there was not any Music , 14th- very good naturedly offer 'd to send for his Violin that we might dance , but this was stop 'd by his being aſsured there would be a Procés commenced against him next day , for infringing the rights of the Band of Musicians , who were paid by the gentlemen , what made this appear ridiculous was that the Musicians were not in the Aſsembly rooms was because they thought there would not be Gentlemen enough to pay them ; as there was no dancing we went into one of the Card Rooms wch . had no party in it -- but our own & were amused by the agreeable Marquise teaching us some french recreations -- similar to Blind Man 's Buff & c & c My Dear Madam I have beg 'd Lewis the 15th to a me to add a Postcript to her Letter , & now she has done so , I almost scruple making use of her Permiſsion , because it takes up ye : Paper She would otherwise fill . & I know what it must be to you to receive her Letters . I shall therefore in as few words as poſsible beg you to be aſsured how sensibly I feel my obligations to you for ye : Treasure you intrust me with = She is the most delightful Companion I ever travelled with , & I really hope , she will return to you not the worse for this little Excursion -- She is I thank God quite well , both the Waters & Bathing seem to agree with her -- L : the 14th . & I are charmed with her , & I aſsure you She is much admired , but I am a very careful Chaperone . Adieu ma trés chere Madme : nous parlons Francais du matin jusqua ' u Soir , mi Lord vous presente ses baisemains -- & permettez que Je vous offre mes d R espects & toute la reconnaisance , qui vous est dit , de la part de votre Servante Obbeeist & tres humble the German Emperor Otho a thousand Thanks for ye goodneſs to my Child . ) There is a Taro -table in the rooms and 3 desperate Gamesters hold the Bank -- it is very painful to observe the agitation of those who play , both men & women . France Friday 23 d . August 1776 After Breakfast I walkd with The Marquise de la B : & the Marquis de la Bedoyere to a Church upon a Hill near the Town , from whence there is a charming prospect , a poor Woman who resides in a Cottage near the Church brought us chairs and without our asking her went & milked her Cow , whilst we were sitting & waiting for the milk , we saw a poor young woman with a sick infant in her arms , two children followed her , one held a Rosary and a bottle of holy water , and the other two Candles , they went into the Cottage & came out again with the Candles lighted -- they then went to the Church door , the young woman wth- an expreſsive countenance of deep affliction mad a sign to us to follow her , which we did and to our great surprise found a place filled with Straw & Wheat like a granary Barn , wch . we got through with some difficulty at the end of this Barn without any partition was a Chapel filled with Crucifixes and wretched daubs of pictures -- on one side lay an image of Christ , as dead -- dreſsed in mourning , & the Virgin & Two Saints stood behind him , also in Mourning , -- there was an Altar , a Pulpit , Confeſsional chair & c. decorated in as miserable a manner as the Images ; the Ceiling was a Hay loft , filled . The poor young Woman placed her Candles on each side of ye . figure of Christ , & then knelt down with the Sick Child in her arms -- her two other children knelt on each side of her -- they were silent but appeared to offer up prayers with a devotion that was truly affecting , Such a scene is not easily described , but I feel that it will not , easily , be effaced from my memory . We went through the Chapel and discovered the ruins of Some Gothic architecture -- & an open arched Vault with a large Stone Tomb . We gave the young Woman something and left her with very fervant wishes that her prayers might be granted . I bathed at one , . We dined early and walked to Aix la Chapelle where we drank tea at a small House called L'Ceriviſse here there are Baths & Vapeur Baths hotter than those at Bourchet . We went to see a Garden belonging to a Miſs Hamilton , a Needle Merchant , there are in this Garden upwards of 30 figures some as large as as life , of Men & Women , they are composed of Shell work , finished in a stile you could hardly imagine -- notwithstanding Dear Mama your own skill and taste in Shell work -- we went into a large Grotto where some Officers were regaling with Lord D , the inside was entirely covered with beautiful Shell-work of fruits , flowers and other ornaments , in shells , there were figures likewise , the drapery of these were so well executed as to appear at a short distance like painting -- it is said £ 30,00 has been expended in this place -- P Dartrey must be a rich Man for Aix . NB . I do not admire the needle -- Merchants taste -- I dare say he is a Dutch Man . -- Saturday 24 th . Lord & I had a comfortable tete à tète all Morng , she did not wish to go out . We drank tea drank tea in great form at Lady Dartrey s wch . gave me the fidgets most terribly . -- Mr : Kounan came to us in the Eveg . they all sat down to Commerce & I went to my room to scribble till supper time Sunday 25 th . We had prayers early and Mr. Kounan read an excellent Sermon : afterwards I went with Mr. K & Lady Dartrey in a Coach through the principla streets of the Town to see the preparations wch . are making for a great Spectacle , viz : the Reception of one of the Students of a College of Aix la Chapelle . There is one chosen every year out of of 4 Colledges and 6000 Students who has ye . greatest Merit -- the young man who is going to receive these marks of honor is 18 , and has distinguished himself worthy of the prize in several branches of learning particularly philosophy -- he is to enter Louvain this day in triumph , & will be received wth- every demonstration of joy as it is his native place -- there has not been one in this City who has been worthy of this prize honor 140 years , and then it was adjudged to one of his family . The Streets through wch . he is to paſs are decorated with young trees stuck in the ground 4 feet aſsunder , -- fine Shrubs are put out at most of the Windows Doors , in pots , tubs & c We drove through 26 triumphal Arches , every one different , some with coloured & white Egg-shells beautifully & simply entermixt wth- Ever-greens -- others equally pretty with flowers , paintings -- Ribbons , & Feathers & c. -- The young Man 's name , Mrs. Boughton , is embroidered upon Coloured flags with inscriptions of his abilities & c , others with tin Silvered & c -- there are hundreds of colored lamps prepared -- in short every thing yt . can look most gay -- As we re w ere paſsing his Father s House Miſs Boughton 's ordered the carriage to stop that we might look at its decorations , & seeing some Servants at the Door , he call 'd one and sent a handsome meſsage ( in all our names ) of congratulations on an event wch . must be sensibly felt by Parents -- ( was not this amiable in Mr- Foster ? but a heart benevolent and overflowing with the milk of human kindneſs like his is always on the alert . ) The family were at dinner but the Mother & Sister came out , and invited us to be at their house at 4 o'Clock , that we might be better able to see the proceſsion , afterwards join in the cavalcade , & be 2 thus 1 able 3 to see the whole . He is to go to the Cathedral where Te Deum is to be finely performed , after that to ride through all ye . Streets & go to the Hotel de Ville , where ye- Burge Maester , & Towns People are to make him a speech in Latin , after which there will be a magnificent Supper : every Town he paſses through from Aix make him a present , Lord a considerable one -- I believe I heard £ 2,000 ; and he would take place of any Prince , Duke & c. if there was one in the town , on this day -- Lady Dartrey gives him the upper hand . A Silver Basin & Ewer are likewise given to him at the Town House . The Father of this young Man is a Merchant worth £ 6,000 , he is esteemed a worthy respectable character . The Bells ringing and guns firing in every part of the Town . I dreſsed myself as gay & fine as I could , so did every one , and at ½ past 3 I went in a Coach with Josephus Widlt & Lord Dartrey -- ( Ld . Dartrey had a cold & did not like to venture out ) again ) and the young Gentleman & Prince Charles of Lorrain in another , we got to the Father s House through an innumerable crowd , there , there were aſsembled , Uncles , Cousins , & c ; The Mother appears a plain sensible Woman & who seemed to support her happineſs with the great -- greatest propriety -- the Proceſsion arrived at last , it was a long one -- the young Man is handsome and has a charming countenance full of sense and sweetneſs , he rode a White Horse -- had an air of Modesty , bowed and smiled gracefully and waved a Branch of Laurel , they had put in to his hand -- we followed the proceſsion to the Cathedral and returned home , in a quarter of an hour had the pleasure of kiſsing our hands to him as he paſsed our windows in Calvalade , as before , the whole Town is illuminated ; Balls & feasting will continue some days ; Prince Chs . of Lorrain supped wth- us . Monday 26 August Walking Bathing & c. in ye . Morng -- dined early -- All our party went to tea at our favourite Marquise 's Lodgings , he gave us a very pretty Concert , he played , well , himself on the Violin -- and Lord Dartrey treated us with some of her sweet songs ; Lady Dartrey & Mr. Foster return 'd with us to supper We recd . a polite meſsage from the Marquise ( the young Student is so stiled ) to envite us to the great Ball at the Jesuists ' College -- we all went after making some alteration in our dreſs -- we drove through a great concourse of people , every Tree had a Lamp stuck in it wch . with all the other decorations had a beautiful effect -- there was a fine Ball , I danced with the Marquis de La Bedoyere who is a fine dancer and as I felt more acquainted with him I declined other partners to the number of 8 . I had the honor of dancing a Cottilion with the Primus who preſsed hard that I would stay the entertainment that was to follow the Ball -- Lady Dartrey offered to be my chaperon if if I chose to remain , I prefer̄ 'd returning home wth- the M : ; we left the Ball at ½ past ten , a late hour at Louvain . Marquise and his Lady supped with us and very merry we all were . Tuesday 27 th . August 1776 Aix la Chapelle In reply to the Primus 's question pray inform him that I have enquired , & am told that the Flemish Farmers never let their Lands lie fallow but sew them succeſsively wth . different kinds of Grain , & pulse , as best suits the Ground which they occasionally aſsist by manure of wch . I observed they were very sparing . To continue my journal -- the Marquis & I walked about the Town all Morning -- the Marquise being a little indisposed did not wish to go out , we went to the Jesuits College where the Ball was yesterday to see some pictures -- found they were only indifferent Copies -- from good & bad originals -- went to the Hotel de Ville or State House wch . is a large building wth . some large Showy Rooms in wch . were Pictures not worth looking at , There was however a large Picture by Lady Dartrey -- ye subject -- The last judg-ment -- it is in wretched condition -- Another said to be by The Marquis -- Representing Mr .. Glover giving the Charter to ye . Magistrates of Aix la Chapelle -- In the great Room is an interesting Picture , but not well painted , of all the persons aſsembled at the Congreſs wch . was held at the Peace in the year 1748 when Lord Dartrey was the English Minister -- there are likewise single Portraits of each Ambaſsador at that time of the different Nations employ 'd , they are badly painted -- when we returned to the Hotel found a polite sensible , agreeable Man in conversation wth Ly.- D—— he is the Polish Ambaſsador at Aix la Chapelle -- he paid the visit as having lodgings in the same Hotel -- -- now in Rome or London this would not be thought leſs than impertinent -- but as ye saying is , different Countries different Customs . 27 August 1776 Rubens , is here in his way frm . England to Spa , Vandyck invited him to dinner -- his conversation was entertaining & interesting -- he related many anecdotes of the celebrated the Emperor Charlemagne -- This singular eccentric characte d r was at Paris with Lord Sandwich at the time of the Congreſs : -- The Germans could not find time for relaxation & expreſs 'd great surprise that Ly Dartrey & Mr. Lovel Stanhope always got their busineſs forward yet did not appear to pay proper attention to it , for Lord Dartrey spent his Mornings at Cricket -- & in the Eveg . Wortley Montague held a Farro Bank -- however Lord Sandwich said they did not neglect their duty , & aſsured us that he had seen 3 Copies of the articles written fair by Ld- Sandwich during that time , a task wch . would have every Moment of any other person s time to have accomplished in the time . Mr. Montagu told us he knew it for fact that as soon at Lord Sandwich had recd- information of his Legal Wife 's death -- he sent Advertisements to be put in the Aix la Chapelle Newspapers -- for a Woman big with Child wch . he would marry -- he wanting to disappoint the next heirs , & c. & c , he also immediately proposed to set out for London wch- coming to the Knowledge of his head wife ( for as a Mahometan i n had several wives ) she gave him Poison wch- caused his death -- there was no truth in other reports circulated , such as his having been choked by a Bone , & c There was nothing Mr. Montague 's spirit dared not attempt & he had genius to accomplish every thing he did attempt . Mr. Lovel Stanhope related the following anecdote There was a Dutch Merchant resident at England who had a beautiful & amiable Wife -- Mr Montague admired the Merchants Lady and got introduced to the Husband to whom he made himself particularly agreeable , & a great intimacy soon took place -- he then took every opportunity to make love to the Lady , she was truly attached to her husband who in return loved her wth ye . truest affection , she she therefore had reason to apprehend the most fatal consequence wd- insue should the infamous treachery of this insidious friend be discovered , & suffered ye . most cruel Martrydom -- this continued for a long time -- Mr. Lovel Stanhope finding her proof against all his wiles changed his plan & became respectful , distant , & reserved -- the Lady flattered herself that he was grown weary of persecuting her & ashamed of the part he had been acting -- & rejoiced that she had had the prudence to conceal his Conduct from her Husband whose partiallity , and unbounded confidence in Mr .. Montague was without bounds . Some affairs required the Merchant s personal attendance in Venice & it was not convenient for him to take his Wife -- he earnestly entreated Mr. Montagu to be her proctetor during his absence telling him he was the only person he thought worthy of such a trust . & departed from Holland wth . a lighter heart than he would have had had he not poſseſsed ( as he imagined ) so true a frd- The Merchant s Wife was far from happy at this arrangement but could not bring herself to awaken suspicion & distrust in a breast whos only aim was to promote her happineſs -- he not only had ye . highest opinion of Mr. Lovel Stanhope s integrity , but thought she would find the separation leſs tedious by having the society of of a person so calculated to amuse by the brilliancy of his wit imagination & inexhaustible fund of entertainment by he poſseſsed by remembering every occurrence of a most extroadinary life , -- ( The vicious part of wch . he however always was on his Guard to conceal ) -- Mr .. Montague behaviour , toward the Lady , was such after her Husband s departure that she had every reason to be well satisfied wth . him & had almost lost recollection of his former base -- conduct -- things were in this state when she recd- a letter with the heart breaking intelligence that her Husband had been taken suddenly ill & was dead Montague did all in his power to aſsuage her Grief He he desired her not to credit the report but to send to Venice for certificates by wch . the certainty of ye . fact could be known -- Montagu wrote -- the fatal certificate arrived -- Montagu s whole study was to endeavour to console ye . wretched Widow -- after a decent time he proposed himself said he lived but for her , & that his unwearied attention deserved some recompence & who could she so properly accept as the Man who had been loved & esteem 'd by her late worthy Husband -- the Widow hesitated some time , she was obliged to acknowledge she lay under particular obligations to him , he had rendered himself servicable to her wth . respect to her affairs & c & c -- & she likewise began to think he truly lov 'd her , for what man would have been so very aſsidious , so long constant -- she lost sight of ye . criminality of his first offers -- she promised to marry him at ye . expiration of a year & till that time he approved of her Residing in a Convent -- they were then married . Will you believe that the Merchant was not dead ? & That Montague had practised ye . same deceit on him by sendg . him forged certificates of his Wife s death -- whose disposition he knew wld . prevent him from returning to place where she died -- This adventure was near 5 Years in acting -- some preſsing affairs obliged the Merchant to revisit Holland , judge what he must have felt on finding his Wife alive & Married to Mr. M—— -- the injured pair sought for redreſs -- Mr. Montagu escaped , & our Ambaſsador screened him from the punishment due to his crimes -- & he was too artful not to be prepared for the worst that could happen . Tuesday August . 27 continued After dinner all our party wth . Montagu , & Montagu & Montagu went to the French Comedy abt . a Mile & ½ from Venice -- the Road bad -- the place call 'd Aix la Chapelle . -- one large house like an Hotel , -- the Country romantic -- The Theatre is small but conveniently contrived -- at ye . end of every act the company go go into Rooms from their Boxes -- where is Lemonade and various kinds of refreshments -- in one Room there is a Billiard Table , & in another a Far̄o bank is held . The Petite Piece was the Pupile of Montagu , it was but indifferently acted -- after this the Opera s of ye De ſs The Man who performed ye . Deserteur had good action & , as far as I am a judge , a fine voice -- the other actors had little to recommend them to admiration yet they recd . applause . -- went to the Rooms in the Eveg -- there was not any dancing as the Primus had engaged the musicians at ye . jesuits College -- Montagu & Mr Lovel -- Standhope sup 'd with us . Wednesday 28 August I again accompanied the Marquis to the jesuits Colledge to hunt after pictures , as he wished to purchase some , as having heard the Paintings and all other moveables were to be sold -- the jesuits being extirpated -- we roamed about the immense building went into numberleſs Rooms , all looked deserted & made one feel quite melancholy -- Marquise de la Bedoyere could not find a Picture worth buying -- I make no doubt the jesuits had valuable pictures but had prudently conveyed them away in secret ; in this Diderot agreed with me . We then went to the Hotel de Ville or Town Hall to meet The Marquis Marquise de la Bedoyere , Lord Dartrey Lord D—— , & Lord Dartrey & Lady Dartrey -- We saw from thence a grand proceſsion it being S t . Austin 's day -- A large braſs Head in wch- were inclosed some of the Saints bones was carried before a number of Priests & a great concourse of people , all walking in pairs , with books in their hands , chaunting Hymns -- The Host was carried under a magnificient Canopy -- the High-priest under another in his best Vestments , his train was borne by two Pages -- the other Priests walkd according to their rank -- all richly clothed . Incense was thrown up , up , all the way , behind them -- The High Priest performed many ceremonies , & the People all knelt upon the pavement . In this Manner they proceeded through all the Streets . -- We then went to see the Play-House wch . is much larger than ye one we were at yesterday -- it has been shut up for two Years on acct of some dis-agreement . We saw at an Apothecary 's a complete & valuable collection of Shells , & Foſsils , -- I regretted time did not allow our seeing them more particularly ; from the Apothecary 's proceeded to a jewellers who had many tempting articles , -- I was most pleased with an elegant snuff Box , wch . on preſsing a small Spring play 'd two or three pretty little airs very sweetly . Here Mr. Dawson & his Lady parted from us , & we call 'd on the Penn 's -- Mr .. Foster & 2 Marquis dined wth- us & left us early -- Marquise de La Bedoyere & the Marquis came to take leave , I had the glory of beating him 2 Games at Cheſs -- you may easily suppose dear Mama he is no capital player , I never can win a Game when I play with You . Lady Webb went to the Bath -- Mrs Miſs Boughton 's & I went for ½ an hour to the Rooms -- then supper , & early to Bed . Thursday 29 th August 1776 Nothing could have afforded me such heartfelt satisfaction my Dearest Mama as your last letter & the comfortable aſsurances of Your being so well , wch . is confirmed by my amiable friends The Marquis & Marquise . -- Lady Dartrey charges me to aſsure you that she is quite penetrated by your constant attention & goodneſs to her dear Boy -- her Servts . have written to inform her how frequently you go to Vaux-hall & the handsome play things you give him -- Lord Dartrey , Master Grenville Penn s Butler , is going to Aix la Chapelle & has promised to take charge of a packet for me . He will deliver it in person , & I wish to give you a hint that he has been Remarkably civil & waited on me as if I had been his Mistreſs -- indeed all Katherine & Anna Maria 's Servants treat me with equal civility , & though I am very careful not to give them trouble , & wait on me as if it was their duty . Ladey Dartrey ( who has lived wth . Mr. Hudson long before before she married -- I believe since she was a Child , ) & I , are quite friends -- she is a worthy creature and truly deserving such a Mistreſs . You will , I believe , my Dear Mama receive a visit from Lord Dartrey who kindly says he will call on you to give you a true & satisfactory account of my health . I will now continue my Journal -- I am happy you so much approve of my writing in this manner . 29 th We left Hammersmith abt . 8 o'Clock . there are the greatest numbers of Beggars & miserable objects in this City poſsible to be conceiv 'd -- lame , deformed in every way , yellow & squalid looking -- it is really very painful to look at them , and they appear to delight in uncloth ed neſs , as they are very idle & indolent . The Children when born are bound up like Mumies wth- bandages -- You will see a Mother in the Streets with a Child some months old in ther arms wch . till you are near enough to observe its Monstrous head you wld- take for a Collar of Brawn bound round ; perhaps it is owing to this method of treating young Children whose that there are so many diminutive deformed creatures -- Yet that can not be the case neither as I am told this Method is pursued all over the Continent , where there are tall men & women & c , & c , & in the Scriptures we read of the Child in swadling Clothes . We dined at England a neat Town , appeared as large as Aix la Chapelle -- the Country surrounding is very beautiful -- There is a very steep hill near ye . Town from whence you have a delightful view -- the road for some Miles is rough & Stoney -- near Verviers is better and ye- Country picturesque & Grand -- Hills covered wth .. wood on each side -- Meadows at the bottom wth . natural Cascades pouring down from the Hills , & a River by ye- side of the Road -- we arrived at Aix la Chapelle by tea time & immediately went to Lodgings -- the Hotel de Lorraine -- Lord has taken the whole House wch- is one of considerable size -- viz . a large drawing Room , Do . Dining Room , Parlour , & c , and abt . 20 other Rooms . Lady Dartrey , a near Relation of the unfortunate Mr- Mrs : Palfrey that lately destroy 'd himself , called on Ly Dartrey he appears a worthy sort of Man ; & a young Coxcomb , a Mr. Foster Spa Friday ye . 30 th . August 1776 In the Morng . went to Lord Dartrey a civil intelligent Bookseller ; gave our names to be printed -- the custom at Spa is to have Cards delivered round by a Man to announce yr . arrival -- the compliment is immediately acknowledged by the visiting Tickets of those who have recd . them , by the same Man . Thus you are introduced to persons of all Nations , visitors at Spa . A Mr Dames , & our agreeable , good humoured Spa acquaintance , Mr Dames called -- In the Eveg . we went to the Comedy -- The Play house is a pretty building in a Circular form -- The Center Box , upstairs , open in s -- ( after the play is over ) into a n large elegant Room , ornamented with White & Gold , it is calld ye ..

Saturday 31 st . August Early this Morning I accompanied Lord D—— to the Geronstere , abt 2 miles from Spa -- met Mr Rumbold . & Daughter ( she is Wife to the youngest Brother of ye . Temples & was the handsome clever Mr Descars whoch you have heard Mr Nugent mention -- as a Young Woman was admired for her beauty ( wch . wld have been perfect but for her forehead wch . was too high & what is called a Knee forehead ye- hair growing too far back & c ) & dreaded for the bitterness of her satirical talents . There were few persons on the walk where the company generally exercise after drinking the Water -- it is cut out between Woods , the Country Romantic , & what I call interesting , the Road Stony & Rough but safe , There is a Room to shelter in , in case of Rain something like a large Barn , but where you may spend Money in Marchandises & Bijouteries -- Lady Monr Butin & I return 'd to Aix la Chapelle to Breakfast -- In the Evening we went to the Ball at Vauxhall -- Spa 1 st Sepbr . 1776 Sunday My Dearest Mama -- An hour ago I recd . -- Your kind letter , & Lady Dartrey was much pleased with the one you wrote to her , she bids me tell You she would answer it was she not much hurried in writing a Number of letters to send to Spa -- the Same post brought her an acct . of your carrying Mrs Harry Grenville a Horse , & how happy you had made him -- Peggy Banks & Mr- Glover charged me wth . many other things to say to you -- wch . I will tell you some other opportunity -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Spa 31 st . continued -- Coll .

We partook of some Bouillion Ld : had prepared for dinner , wch . of course Ly . D—— rewarded her for , & left he r & Master Grenville Penn well pleased wth . our visit . We dined early , then went to the Capu- Capuchin Church to hear Lubin preach -- it was was a very good discourse on Repentance -- he preached extempore , he has a clear good voice & pronounces his words distinctly -- his action chaste ; -- The Prayer before the Sermon was in Latin as were the Texts he quoted . He was dreſsed like the Common Capuchin Monks . After ye . Sermon we walked in the Garden of the Monks wch . is open to all who chuse to avail themselves of ye priviledge . -- We then returned to our Hotel -- & all remain 'd at home .

Many persons remain here all Morning , till dinner time , playing at Farro & other games -- Whist appears a favorite with foreigners as well as English -- Several Young Men have been utterly ruined in their fortunes this Season at Spa , it is chiefly Irish & English who have fallen a prey to Gamesters .

D'armenston have occasioned much disagreeable conversation for some days past -- a Duel is to be fought between & amp ; D'Orcy & Lady Dartrey -- Mrs . ran away but they obliged him to return . These 3 Men have very bad characters -- & they are well known at Waterdrinking places in Spa . After Breakfast Miſs Boughton 's , & I had a pleasant drive tête a tête to the Sauveniere ( one of ye . Mineral fountains ) & took a delightful walk in the Woods , thro ' wch . there are paths cut . -- there is one walk raised at a considerable expence & gravelled ; by some German Count .

I added my mite , & I doubt not but that we left him happier than we found him . The Sauvenire is a place you wd . greatly admire My Dearest Mama -- the Woods , walks , murmuring streams , The Air , the quiet -- & then , if neceſsary , the invigorating Mineral beverage of the Fountain . -- Not having occasion for the Waters I do not drink them .

He gave us a long detail of Lady Webb s illneſs & death -- she died at London last Summer . -- He told us that Lady Dartrey 's Meditations & Lord D : 's Night Thoughts are translated into the German language . It is whispered here that Sr. George Paul was paſsionately in love with Lord Westport , who was elegant , pretty & amiable , & that after she was dead he contrived to get into ye . Chamber where ye .

We went , afterwards to the Rooms & returned home early . Wednesday Septr . 25 th - I went after Breakfast to meet Lord at Vauxhall -- Ly Dartrey & Sir John Webb attended us , & we had a delightful ride for 3 hours -- the little Horses here drink like Cats , & one feels more secure on their backs than scrambling up steep places on ones feet -- we enjoyed the delicious Breezes on the tops of Mountains , & was amused by seeking paths through the close growing Woods .

Mother s side Grand Daughter to the celebrated Quaker Miſs Boughton 's . her Christian Names are Philadelphia Hannah -- her Sur Name Fraeme -- He observed Mrs . 's Paradise lost on ye . table , wch . he offered to read -- there was no refusing , & I was in an agony lest I should get into one of my unfortunate nervous fits of laughing , as indeed was Dr . Miſs Poulteney both for herself & me , for Ld- D—— is one of the worst stutterers I ever heard -- but our fears soon subsided for , after the 5 or 6 first lines of ye . Poem he went on very Philadelphia on with tolerable fluency , & convinced us that he could read as if he well understood ye . sublime Poem , if the impediment of his speech could be removed -- Every one speaks in favor of Mr. H : Brown 's character , it is a great pity he has such singular awkwardneſs of manner & such nervous gestures when he laughs , & dances , as to provoke risibility from those who are not acquainted wth . his sense & merits , & give pain to those who are -- he is a plain Man and has nothing outwards to recommend him ; someone said he was reckon 'd an elegant Claſsic Scholar -- Ly . D : was a c quainted wth : his Father , who was an elegant Latin Poet . Monday Octbr- 7 th - Lady Dartrey came after Breakfast whom I had to entertain for two hours as her Husband dear was engaged in her own Room & Lady Dartrey was out his conversation was sensible & instructive , but it certainly requires patience & attention to listen to him .

Webb & myself left Spa wth- Regret at 9 o'Clock -- the Rain that had fallen made ye .. Cascades very fine till we arrived at the little Village of Calais , abt . 3 Miles & ½ from Spa , where there are many Iron Forges -- stop 'd at the territory of Stavelef -- from thence lost the beautiful Mountains & quitt ed ing the road leading to Taux travelled some Miles over a large barren Heath -- a long Hill led to it wth . naked Mountains on each side -- a melancholy contrast to the lovely scenery we had left -- however 4 or 5 Miles from Leige we had an extensive prospect over a a prodigious fine Country , & we were charmed wth- the approach to Spa -- upon the Hills near ye- Town saw Vineyards , & large Hop Gardens -- they inform 'd us they made 32 Sorts of Beer . We lodge at the Aigle Noir . As do Lord , Lady Dartrey , & Mr. Boyce -- Comte Sarsfield sent Aix la Chapelle to Miſs Boughton 's who resides much at Leige on act- of ye- education of his Children ( I believe we were misinformed abt . his having only one ) he came & joined our party at Dinner -- we play 'd at very low Farren in the Eveg . . Mr .. H : Brown held ye Bank & we were very gay & cheerful . Leige Saturday 12 Octbr- Before we went down to Breakfast Mr. Boyce read Prayers in Lord 's Room -- A Lady Dartrey , her Daugher , & a Sr. John who reside in a Convent at Leige & are Protestants , came to enjoy the satisfaction of joining on worship wth persons of their own persuasion . After prayers we joined our party at Breakfast ( viz . Lady , Mr. Webb & Lord Dartrey ) & Mr. Fitzsimon ) after wch . Lord D : & Mr. Boyce Lord Dartrey & myself set out to see some Churches -- 1 st : to the Cathedral , dedicated to Saint Lambert , the entrance resembles that of Leige , upon the Great Altar were 14 Silver Candlesticks very finely wrought , the highest 6 feet & ½ high , & a beautiful large lamp hung before this Altar . The Porch is curious Gothic ar tt chitectu re adorned with numberleſs figures representing the Martyrdom of S t . Lambert : 2 d . The Jesuits Church nothing here wch . attracted notice but Rich Busts of Saints in Silver upon ye . High Altar . -- Lady Cook related some anecdotes of the Jesuits and desired us to read the History of the Miſsion of Leige . 3 d - S t Pauls , a very large Church , the Screen before the High Altar is of Marble , it is elegant & Simple ; The Roof of the Church is painted & is so pretty & light as to resembl y e Gauze or Tafety -- one tolerably painted Picture of bearing the Croſs . 4 th . The Dominicains -- a large Noble Dome , & 7 very pretty Chapels . 5 th . S t . Jacques -- Gothic , & very richly ornamented , it belongs to the Benedictine order of Monks -- there are 5 neat & beautiful Chapels behind the Great Altar -- fine painted Windows on wch . are represented the History of S t . Benoit -- The Roof is light , & c & c & & there are some very large figures of Saints in Marble well executed . We transcribed ye . following lines under one of on a Tomb over them wch- hangs a picture of S t . Bernoit dying wth- a Pigeon coming down in a Glory -- De sa chambre Benoist au Ceil levant les yeux Apparoit un Pigeon qui penetrait les Cience Cest l'ombe de sa Sœur sous cette resemblance qui va chercher la prix de sa grande innocence . The reason of the number of Altars in ye . Romish Churches is for different Priests to officiate , & who generally receive the Sacrament every day . Miſs Crosby , Sr. J . , & c then went wth . us to the English Convent -- the Reverend Mother had recd . notice of the intended Visit -- She came to ye . Grate of the Parlour & desired we would go round to the Stairs where she recd us , attended by 30 Nuns whose faces were covered by their Veils -- they ranged themselves on each side & bowed as we paſsed -- they then lifted up their Veils -- We were shewn the whole Convent wch . was remarkably neat , the Cells were similar to each other , viz : a Small bed , small Oak Chest -- of Drawers , a Stool to Kneel on , a little Table upon wch . were placed a Crucifix , an Hour Glaſs , & a book . over wch were hung a few wretched bad Prints . The floors of Oak bright & slippery as Glaſs , within the Doors of the Cells there two pieces of quilted Cloth -- wch . they walk or rather slide on that no Noise may disturb ye . silence wch . ought to reign -- or those who are beneath -- The Cells are 10 feet long & 5 wide with a large Window at ye . end wch is neither fastened nor barred . There are many neat Altars in different parts of ye . Convent , ornamented with Flowers & Paintings , under one was represented our Saviour lying in the Sepulchre -- many shabby prints hung round the Walls of the Paſsages in wch . are Lottery 's for Souls on Purgatory , which ye- Satry Octbr 12 th . Canterbury the Nuns draw out as they paſs & utter a short prayer -- one of the Nuns desired me to draw a ticket out of the Box , wch . I complied with -- it was for those who had never given Alms for the love of God . We saw their work Room wch . is large & meanly furnished , they shewed us beautiful artificial Flowers of their making & paintings in Miniature also many in Crayons & Oil . We saw Lady 's Sister who has been in this Convent ever since she professed , wch . is 50 Years , she is well-bred in her manner & appeared very chearful . One of the Nuns gave us an account of their stile of living -- they rise Summer & Winter at 4 o'Clock & spend two hours in mental prayer in the Choir of the Chapel , then they Breakfast , ( except it is a fast . day when they do not take any food till ye . hour of dinner wch . is half past 11 o'Clock ) after Breakfast they sit in ye . work-Room , all together , till prayer time , after prayers they dine in a large Room where there never is a fire -- after dinner a Nun sits in a Pulpit in ye . dining Room & reads to the rest -- after Supper a Nun reads an hour & ½ . They are not prohibited talking unleſs it is a strict fast day & then they have not , what they call , that recreation : They are not allowed to visit each other in their Cells without permiſsion , nor may they go to their Cells during the day but for an hour when they dust them , -- the laborious part of the work in the Convent is done by Servants . After dinner & Supper they go into the Choir to Pray & Sing . ( One of the Nuns , whose name is Mr Webb , play 'd to us on the Organ with taste & skill ) -- After ye . Prayers after dinner they return to the work Room , they keep silent for some time at their work & a Nun reads aloud , this is an indulgence . They Sup at 6 & go to bed at 9 -- there are not any fire-places in their Cells , there is only fire kept in the work room , & that only in severe weather if they Paraguay they are ill they are put in the Infirmary ( in ye . Church Convent ) The Abbeſs of this Convent is stiled Reverend Mother . She has a small fire place in her Cell , wch . is twice as large as the others , therefore if she is ill she is not removed to the Infirmary she shewed us a common Rush bottom great Chair wch . she said she never indulged herself to sit on unleſs she was ill. -- We saw their Apothecary 's Shop wch . is a Room well stored with Drugs , simple waters & c & c One Nun makes up the chief of the medicines -- there are days appointed for the poor to come , who have Clothes , Medicines , & money given to them -- Many Convents do the same therefore Nuns do not lead such useless lives as is generally supposed . At this Convent they converse more in English than French , & in most respects not so strict as most others . The prohibition of not profeſsing under a certain age does not extend here for we saw a Girl who was not 16 , in her year of probation dreſs 'd in the same Manner as the Nuns , only her garments were White -- All their Bread is made in the House & they shew 'd us a Granary stacked with Corn . We saw a Nun who had been married & lived ten years in ye . World , her Husband died 3 Years ago , she came here & profeſsed . There are a great many Pensioners , or young Ladies boarded here for their education , we saw ye . School Room -- two young Nuns were teaching ye . use of the Globes -- the Bed Rooms of the Pensioners were very airy & remarkably clean & neat . The Name of ye . Reverend Mother is Mr- Boyce -- she must have been extremely handsome -- her features are beautiful , & her countenance very sweet -- her complexion pale & delicate -- her manners gentle & elegant . The Nuns were polite & chearful & addreſsed their conversation to ye . Gentlemen & wth . equal ease as they did to the ladies . -- I believe we saw every part of In yt wth- constant attendance on ye Public & frequent attendance on ye Poor they do & c Leige of their House & Garden . Lord is much accomplised , and draws & Paints as well as she plays -- she was educated here , when she had finished her education her Father , ( a rich Banker ) sent for her to Leige , & a young Gentleman wished to marry her -- but neither the endearment of Parents , the pleasures of the World , nor a Lover , could get ye . better of her predilition for leading the life of a Nun , after some time she gain 'd her point , & came back to this Convent & took ye . Veil -- she is a well looking Woman . Our Party proceeded from the C N unnery to Lady Dartrey s Lodgings , there were 9 besides ourselves , in all 16 -- many Irish & English Catholic 's reside at Leige -- tho ' it happened to be a fast day & that there was no butchers Meat -- the dinner was plentiful , elegant , & exquisitely cooked . Mr. Webb had prepared another dinner for Mr. Webb & Mr Fitzsimon , & c two days ago , but ye . weather had obliged Webb 's to send an excuse -- this had mortified the hospitable Lord Stourton , as that was not a fast day -- & c & c. We left him abt 10 -- he came however to attend us to our Hotel -- Wright & Miſs Wright sup 'd wth- us , -- Dennis sat an hour wth . me in my bedchamber , -- had some interesting conversation , & she gave me a general outline , & description of the disposition of the French wch . who she had been obliged to aſsociate with . Sunday Octbr . 13 th Parted from Miſs Wright whom we left at England to return to Leige , & from Mr FitzSimon for a day , as Mr Fitzimon was obliged on acct- of securing Horses to set off before them . Leige is situated on the River Maes or Muse over wch . there are many Bridges -- one in particular , we drove over under one of i o f its Arches which was ye . Street over the River . There are a great many Churches & Monastries consequently numerous Eccliasticks -- A large University , wch . is celebrated for learning & c -- A great Manufactory for Guns , & Steel Wares -- A very considerable trade is carried on in Trais 's , what we saw were fine , but ye . price extremely high , they have ye . art of dying ym of various beautiful col ours , & also on stripes . The City of Spa is delightfully situated , the surrounding or contiguous Hills are picturesque -- the Town is populous , very large , dirty & Narrow Streets , the Houses of an extroadinary height -- It is very richly endowed yet they told us there was above 60,000 poor , -- the numberleſs miserable we saw in ye . Streets was shocking . Lord is the richest & most considerable Prince in Leige , he has a great Revenue from gaming Tables at Leige & other places . We saw Dogs in abundance drawing such kind of Carts as Aſses they do in Germany . The Streets are lighted at Night by Lamps hanging by Ropes in the Middle of ye . Streets , the Ropes being fasten 'd to ye : Houses on each side : -- Spa , England , and all considerable Towns are lighted in the same Manner , so I have been told is Bruſsels -- it answers well as the Streets have no convenient flag 'd foot path but Kennels at ye . sides & people walk in ye . middle of ye- Streets where the Carriages drive . 13 th - Octbr . We left Lisle at 10 o'Clock got to Ourai at 12 , a post & ¼ , ( a post is 6 miles ) at 2 got to Paris , 1 post & ¼. at 4 to Leige 2 Posts -- where we din 'd -- Got to St. Trone , 2 Posts -- at Lodged at ye .

Monks opened a Door & undrew a Curtain wch . hung over a large Diamond Croſs , he brought it close to us to see the Saint Sacrament wch . he said was really in the Center of ye . Croſs wch . is two feet high most beautifully & richly adorned with Diamonds , Rubies , Pearls , & Emeralds -- it was i t s wide in proportion to its height & entirely covered with fine Jewels -- a Sun is represented in ye . Center , very rich , & ornamented with Flowers , leaves , & c . in precious stones . the donations made to this Church on account of its being in poſsesion of this miraculous Jewel having ye . real S t . Sacrament inclosed in it are prodigous , within the last 4 Years it has received forty thousand florins . This City was founded by Mr Fitzsimon -- the Town is ill built -- looks very ancient , is situated in a most fertile Country , its chief Trade Linnen -- there are 27 Convents & 25 Monastries -- 40 Colleges , and 2 English Colledges -- the Unversity is esteemed the first in Louvain .

Written by a Lady -- given me by Pierre 1er London Octbr- 1776 Thou whom wandring fancy leads , Near this gloom of lonely Shades Come ( for thou hast nought to fear ) Draw thee nigh and lend thy Ear . 2 If thy soul ambition fires , Wayward hopes and rude desires Motives selfish insincere Go thy ways -- for peace is here . 3 If thou sigh'st for wordly store , And thy bosom beats for more If thy heart pale envy glows , Think not here to find repose . 4 If thy heart is not sincere If one ungentle thought is there , One rude wish one vice begot , Beat thy breast and mourn thy lot . 5 Here the dreary Willow grows ; Here the weeping streamlet flows , How could these thy fancy quell Wayward Stranger fare thee well . 6 But if e'er thy bosom knows What delight from virtue flows ; What the bliss from silence springs , What repose contentment brings : 7 If thy soul is all serene Free from envy free from Spleen , /Free from Free from pride and guilty fear Gentle Stranger draw thee near . 8 Merit clad with simple Weeds Hast thou mark 'd how sore he bleeds Pilgrim like how sad he goes : Thro ' this dreary scene of woes ? 9 Hast thou answer 'd misry 's cry Dry 'd his cheek and wiped his Eye ? Sooth 'd his soul when passions move ! Bath 'd the wounds of bleeding love ? 10 Canst thou relish artless youth , Lonely peace and simple truth , Pity mild with streaming Eye , Rural nymph simplicity . 11 When dejected worth was low , Sunk in undeserved woe , Has thy bosom heard the Sigh ? Has thy tear bedewd thine eye . 12 Canst thou relish Cypres Vales ? Cheerless Grotto 's , lonely dales , Mourning streams and Midnight glooms Where the Cherub Hope ne'er comes . 13 Lonely Pilgrim bend thy Knee Drop thy staff and follow me , Sweet and soft is virtues toil Here at least repose a while .
