Hampton Court Palace Sepbr- 4 My Dear Sir , I am by nature grateful , and flatterd by the remembrance of my friends . therefore you may suppose how obliged I am for the Brace of Partridges , but am sorry my thanks will cost you four Pence , as we do not here deal in Members of Parliament , & having offerd you my thanks I have nothing to relate worth one farthing . I was last Week at Windsor for a few hours to make my dutiful Inquires . and call u p two or three of my Intimates who are there on melancholy Attendance . among them was Miſs Golsworthy , looking uncommonly well . but deafer than when I left London . she quite shock 'd me as she does not hear one word in ten , even with the aſsistance of ye . Trumpet my love to Miſs Goldsworthy and Mrs- Dickenson . have you Danced Louisa into his Grave ? or does he Live to be admir 'd by me ? I hope you have found a House to your taste , with a Saloon for all Frederick Morris 's Curiositys , and in ye . Neig hbourhood of , Dear Sir , Your Obliged , and Humble Servant , Mrs- Dickenson .
