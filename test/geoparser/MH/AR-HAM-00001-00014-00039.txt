Queens Lodge Friday -- Yesterday I had no time to write , a s I should my Dear have thanked you for your excellent Epistles , but I went to see Dr Lady Charlotte the Queen went with the Princeſs 's to see the Stag turned out , & graciously off ered to send me to Harleyford , which I gladly accepted , & really found her upon the whole better then I expected , her Deafneſs I own would not strike me , but she compl ains more of the uneasy feel of in her Head & the violent fit of Coughing she still has Morg & Evg , I think her looks are not bad , nor do I find her too much fallen away , I am clear that what I always suspected is true & that Ld Winchilsea s departure & c & c is the cause of her Complaint , she talked of him to me & cryed , so Lady Louisa said she had done with her , & she thinks her Disorder greatly Nervous . I am happy to hear my Dear Prſs Elizh mends , I think of her perpetually & if my earnest Prayers could succeed she would soon be quite well . The Princeſs 's are gone out with the Queen , it may seem odd , but I litteraly do not know where they are gone , tho I rather suspect to Mr Nevill s , our Life here is so much the same that it can not afford Subject for a Letter . Miſs Planta is as usual the most pleasing best hum ored Creature that can be , & is of infinite Service to me , I hope she is better & upon the whole flatter myself the change of Air will have been of Service to her . Adieu my Dst I hope you are really well , Love to Mou Mou & Chi , Chi , & believe me most Affy Yr MCGoldsworthy I was to have enclosed a Letter to Pſs Elzh from Pſs Augusta but she is in a perverse fit and I have declared I will not send it -- Miſs Hamilton S t James 's
