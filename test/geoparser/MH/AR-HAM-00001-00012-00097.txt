Caldas . Septr . 15 th . 1781 My Dear Miſs Goldsworthy , From July 21 st . to Septr . 10 th , no Packet arrived at Lisbon , but at last it is come , & has made us amends for our long Expectations by the many kind Letters it has brought & good Accounts of our friends , except of yourself my dear , whose Letter dated the 13 th . of August , makes me very anxious about your health , you had already been confined a fortnight , & your Complaint continued obstinate after two bleedings , I hope you will have wrote soon again , or I aſsure you I shall be quite unhappy about you . I sincerely feel for the sad Disappointment it must have been to you not to partake of the Festivities on the Prince of Wales 's birth-day , their Majesties goodneſs shews itself upon every occasion & I am sure their bringing the dear little Princes ( from Kew ) to see you must have been quite a Cordial to you . I shall enclose in this a Letter for my dear Princeſs Augusta whose kind Attentions in writing to me & the prettiest most entertaining Letter imaginable , I am very sensible of . pray present the enclosed with my Grateful Duty to H R H . I hope all the Letters I did myself the honr . of writing to the m 3 Princeſses have long before this been received . I am now in the busiest of my Preparations for leaving this Place , but my Dear Miſs Goldsworthy , think what an Undertaking I am going upon , if we make the Journey by Land wch . I rather think we must , as no Neutral Veſsels but Portuguese offer at this time to carry us , & later in ye Year we could not venture a Sea Voyage . Mrs Feilding by no means approves of a Portuguese Veſsel so that nothing remains but a good Resolution , to encounter the difficulties & tediousneſs we must expect in a Land Journey . Lord Winchilsea thank God continues well , & is so anxious to ſee us safe in our Journey as far as France , that he means to accompany us to Bordeaux at least , as probably that will be our Route , I hope it will agree with him & then as to Climate I shall think him as well off in the South of France for the Winter , as if he had staid at Lisbon I am much obliged by her Majesty s gracious Meſsage about my Absence , but my Mind once satisfied about Ld Winchilsea 's Safety , I have no wish so strong as to return to my Duty , & he is equally anxious that I shd , being gratefully Sensible to both their Majesties for their kind Indulgence to me on his Account , & it is not without putting a great restraint upon himself that he does not come personally to expreſs it , but the Injunctions from all the Physical People are so strong for his not attempting to go to England till the Winter is over that he has yeilded to it , & promises only to go till he sees us in some safe & comfortable Train of proceeding in our Journey . Poor Mrs Feilding 's Accident , will neceſsarily occasion her a longer Absence from her Duty about the Queen ( which she wish 'd to perform ) as well as a longer Anxiety about her little family , which has been encreas 'd by this last packet bringing her the Account of the Severe Illneſs poor little Matilda has gone thrō , which thō at the same time she heard she had quite recover 'd yet it has awaked in her Mind a thouſd . Apprehensions of what may happen in so long an Absence . Her Majesty is very good to have consider 'd me so much in wishing Mrs F . to have remain 'd on with me , but as the Case stood when she set out , I could not well let her miſs such an Opportunity of returning as she had in joining Mr & Mrs. Graham , for I own to you I then thought Ld W . so far from being compleatly recover 'd , that I had thrō her petition 'd the Queen for a longer Stay with him , in which Case Mrs F : might have been kept too long away , as we did not know of Mr Feilding s coming . She & Harriet both send their Love & wishes to hear of your recovery . I will only add how sincerely I wish it , & remain ever my Dear Miſs G most affecte . & Faithful CFinch Remember me kindly to every body To Miſs Goldsworthy
