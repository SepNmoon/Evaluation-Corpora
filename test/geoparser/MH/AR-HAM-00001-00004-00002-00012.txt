Dear Sir , I have received a letter from my Agent in Scotland , acquainting me that as the Gentleman from whom he expected to receive the Thousand Pounds , was not then in Edinburgh , nor had even given him a positive answer , tho ' it was to have been paid on the 11 th . of this Inst . I was certainly very properly at liberty not to consider him any further in the matter . I shall therefore avail myself of your goodneſs to me , and will immediately execute a proper Bond for your security , which shall be ready to be deliver 'd to any Person you may think proper to authorize me to give it on your behalf ; it shall be dated as I formerly mention 'd from the day your Bill was sent from Manchester . As for the Scotch part of the busineſs , that will now require a new arrangement , which may be very safely deferr 'd till I have the pleasure of seeing you . In the mean time I beg you will be aſsured that I shall consider your interest with every possible attention , and that I shall be ready , with the utmost pleasure , to return your money into your hands , wherever you may think proper to signify your inclination to receive it . Notwithstanding the loſs of the King 's Theatre in the the Haymarket , we are to have greater doings in music than ever the ensuing Winter & Spring . Marchesi certainly returns , we had a letter from him yesterday ; Pacchierotti is already here with some new great Instrumental Performers . I beg to offer the Compts . of my Family to you & Mrs. Dickenson & remain with great regard Dear Sir , Your Affectionate & obliged Humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street . N o . 249 .
