3 d Janry 1785 Hampton And so we all fell in love at first sight did we ? For the paſsion You Say Mr. D . conceived for us is returned with interest . In Mrs. Garrick you will have a most formidable Rival , She therefore desires You may be told of your danger , which is an instance of generosity not very usual on these occasions . Seriously tho ' , we are delighted with his unaffected agreeable manners , and shou 'd think him very interesting , even without that desire of thinking him so which his connexion with You wou 'd naturally inspire . I suppose I may by this time condole with You on his loſs ; for that reason I am glad that I may congratulate you on the arrival of Your other dear friends whose society will help to console You I hope our dear Mrs. Carter has had a prosperous Journey , and that You find her well and in Spirits ; pray aſsure her of my most affectionate love . -- / I hope you have thank 'd the Duchſs .. of Portland again and again for her noble bounty to my poor Poeteſs , rich Poeteſs I must now call her , as her affairs go on so prosperously . When You see Mrs. Delany pray tell her that I most respectfully offer her all the good wishes of this good season and that I heartily wish every new Year may bring with it an augmentation of bleſsings to her . If you have not seen White 's ( Arabic Profeſsor ) Sermons let me recommend them to You . They are a Parallel between the History and Doctrines of Christ and of Mahomet ; they are written in a noble and manly strain of Piety , sense , and intelligence of the Subject ; they unite a good temper with a warm Spirit , and are eloquent without affectation . As far as I have read I am charmed with 'em When you write to me , which in charity ought to be soon , pray mention how Lady Dartrey does as I was much concerned to h had not been well . And besure tell me that Mr. Walpole is quite recovered , or I shall take it very ill at your hands , I can tell you . Mrs. G . unites in kind love with Your very affectionate & faithful H. More Have you had any comfortable Parties yet , and where ? Hampton last day of the old Year -- Heaven send us a happy new one ! To Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street Picadilly
