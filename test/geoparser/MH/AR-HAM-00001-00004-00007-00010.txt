St. Petersb : g 1 n . s . Janry 177 0 Dear Brother , I take the opportunity of a Meſsenger going to London to wish you , Mrs. Hamilton & your Daughter , a happy New year and better health than for these last years past . I wont reproach you for not having wrote to me , nor I wont allow you to say that I am unmindful of my Eldest Brother . Indeed I shd . be unjust to myself did I give room for such an appearance , & you would be so to me , did you think yourself forgot . This Country particularly often puts you in my thoughts , I believe it is much improved in its buildgs since that date , another difference is , that now , that they are very refined , after the french taste in their way of living ; drinking is out of fashion but E ating , to say the truth has tak en its place . There is great plenty of fish flesh & fowl ( All froze at prest ) but I think every thing has a better taste in Engd than here . Mutton I never taste nor do I like any one Ruſsian dainty such as Caviar Sterlit are but witht : these there are plenty & variety sufficient , & now that we are settled & have all our Poultry fatted at home I think you wd . approve of our Table in all re sp ects , & otherwise of our House wch . is in one of the finest streets called La Grande Mosckaie . Our Summer residence is lent us , by the G. Duke it was built & laid out by Chancellor Bestuchett & is in an Island a few Wersts from St. Petersb : g Called Kaminoj Ostroff , we like it very much & it is given to us again for next Summer . The Cold dry air here proves specifick for My Dear Lord thank God his health is perfectly restored . he offers you his most Affectionate Complimts : as does your Three Nephews & three Nieces who are all prodigeously grown & I must so far forget for a momt . that they are my Children as to tell you , what I dare say you will h ear with pleasure that they are universally reckoned here a very remarkable fine family . They are all good natured Children & nothing is spared for their Education . I heartily wiſh you may think at their return that they desarve what has been said all the family as well as my Ld e njoy perfect health The Court has I believe always been since the first of the Empreſs 's very brilliant , it is so now , & the Reigning Sovereign , is the finest Woman in Every distinguishing quality & perfection , in her K ingdom : she has been very extraordinarily fortunate in the Succeſs of the first Campaign , the Second probably will be decicive . They speak here upon these victories with the utmost moderation . I sometimes see Genl Fullarton , he is I think very fond of you & if you would send him your Compliments I am sure it would please him he had the Command in Petersbg last Summer , Mr. Fowel remembers you & Consul Swallow who has been long here , & much & justly Esteemed . Lord Marischal is settled with the K of Prusia he writes to me sometimes he is a Charmg Old man & as lively as at forty Adieu My Dear Brother once more remember me kindly to yourself & family & believe me Ever your most Affectionate Sister & Humble Servant .
