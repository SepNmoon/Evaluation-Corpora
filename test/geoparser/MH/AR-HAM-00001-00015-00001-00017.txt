St James 's December 5 th a rambling life and a teazing painful complaint , has made me paſs over the fortnight you had prescribed to me for directi n g my letters to Taxal -- This I shall addreſs to you at Courteenhall aſsured that ere now you are settled in Ly Wake s neighbourhood & that she will take good care of my letter & transmit it to you -- Unlucky , unfortunate inded am I in again miſsing you in Northamtonshire , but when was I otherwise , we are absolulety like the Man & Woman in the weather House , never out or in togethe r I never had an idea of your havi n g any of being confined at Northamton -- I am truly rejoiced to think that you will be under Dr Kerr s Eye and Care -- I can not then but feel perfectly comfortable and easy about you -- & this , as I can not have even a hope of seei n g you , is a great satisfaction to me . You are at Northamton by this time , I long to hear where you are settled & whether comfortably , it must give you some of the feels of home & recall those of early youth and enjoyment ! I can hardly represent you to myself in the Character of a Mother and a nurse , or fancy you making all your little caps & shirts but I feel that in that light and in that situation , I shall admire and love you at least as well as in any other I have hitherto seen you -- The alteration in my Plan & arrangement respecting Horton , was made in consequence & on account of Bell 's state of Health which required her absence from that place , and frequent change of air and scene . My Father always intending goi n g to Bath about this time so that tho ' my Sister is quite recovered we had no opportunity of returning there to Horton -- they set out of Bath on Tuesday last -- my Sister went from St Leonard 's Hill where we had been sometime , I met my Father at Oxford -- they have got a House in Brock street -- the Town is very full but not of their acquaintance , I hope & imagine they will both like their sejour there , my Father the early & regular Hours my Sister the dancing -- as for myself I detest the Place dancing is not absolute ly my paſsion , tho ' it is often pleasant in an impromptu private way , and as to early hours , I keep them here . what delightful mild weather we have had , and have -- I can not tell you how vexed I was to come to Town & leav e my pleasant walks , and my pleasant Society -- I have been flying from place to place the whole Autumn , & my regrets at leaving one Friend for another , have been lost in the prospect of a quick return to them -- I went again to Mrs Wilmot s , to the Ly Kerr 's -- we had danci n g & singi n g & good sense , and wit , a great deal of laughi n g and merrine ſs I have been with the Hobart 's , with Ly Carlisle at Putney again -- with Madame de Reventelau -- at Richmond Park , at St Leonard 's -- sometimes with the gay , then with the wretched -- for Mrs Stuart is still so , & will not soon recover the loſs of an amiable , beloved Daughter -- I have alternately paſsed a week , in a serious , or quiet tête à tête & another in the midst of a circle of 20 People -- I have been gravely playi n g at Whist & cribbagge , & then laughi n g & cheati n g at Pope Joan -- Inshort whilst I tr was last at Mrs Harcourt s , I was appointed Lectrice to the society and every mor n i n g read a French Drame or story of some kind , loud to a very attentive audience , from which I generally drew tears , for the choice of the lecture bei n g left to me , you may imagine it was of a serious or affecting nature -- I was drove to Town by a Pain in face which I believe I have mentioned to you before my dear , & for which concludi n g it to be the toothache I had two teeth drawn -- I had been kept awake in torture so many nights , that Mrs Harcourt & Stuart insisted on my coming to see Dr Turton , who thinks it is rheuma tism from my bei n g almost perfectly free from it till I go to bed -- he comes every day & is very attentive to me . I hope my dear that I shall be able to give you a better account of myself when I write again -- I came on Friday & have never left my room since then -- how long I am to be confined to it I know not , but I know that I am not in the least impatient to be released -- what can be more comfortable than to be placed in a clean warm chearful habitation , with Musick , Books , pen & ink & every means of amusement -- to be able to breathe without difficulty , & to lie down when one is sleepy -- to be spared the misery of dreſsing twice a day & the still greater one of keeping 1000 disagreeable engagements -- Those Friends who care for me & for whom I care will certainly come to me -- as for all others , I never wish now to set my eyes on them -- what a pleasant line to draw , & how impoſsible to draw it , by any other means whate ver They tell me that the Town is full -- the Play Houses -- Parties every night -- thank God I only hear of them -- the amusement in the mor n i n g is , for Beaus & Belles soi disant old & young to shoot arrows at a mark ! at night they all play at Loo -- & have a uniform ! I fancy the P. of W -- & Mrs Fit . tho ' Man & Wife are not yet tired of each other -- they say he is more in love , more attracted & more entirely hers than ever -- what a crush of all confidences , probabilities & wise predictions ! je n ' y comprens rien , nor does anybody else I believe -- Pſs Eliz is at this moment , at least she was a few Days ago , fairly well -- v astly better than she was -- but I much fear by all accounts that the first severe weather will throw he r back -- and a relapse can not but be attended with t he utmost danger -- everybody loves her -- adores her -- Miſs Goldsworthy will I think break her heart if she dies -- Mr Digby is not in Town nor have I seen him since June -- he is very well tho ' I hear -- Ly Lucy has been extremely ill , but is now rather better -- he is vastly out of spirits about her -- I suppose he will be here for New Year 's Day -- There is just a poſsibility of my goi n g to Bath , which on one account and only one , that of seei n g my Family , I shall be glad of . I have promised Mrs Harcourt to go with her if her Health makes a journey neceſsary -- She has been very unwell lately but it draws too near the Birthday to be practicable , if no t u ndertaken immediatly -- I conclude Col. Cathcart is at Dallington -- I have never seen him yet , to talk to him about his Friend Mr Young , or to thank him for his attentions to me -- he was so good as to call here in my absence & to take a letter & c which he has promised to convey to India -- if you see him thank him for me and ask him a little about Mr Young -- I hear Ld & Ly Cathcart like Dallington -- my sudden disappearance from Horton prevented me waiti n g upon her , which I shall take the first opportunity of doi n g on my return -- My Brother has just left me , he came for a few Days to Town to see me and tomorrow goes to Bath -- so here I am left alone -- it is very odd , that I never had any illneſs ( my continued complaint in my stomack excepted ) but in the absence of my Family -- Charlotte is very well , & pretty good -- she gives me great pleasure & promises me great comfort -- she is very very clever -- & quick -- but is not very fond of work -- T hank you my dear for inquiri n g -- Ad ieu my very dear Friend , I beg to hear if but in two words that you are settled comfortably -- you have my constant & ardent prayers , for that your confinement may be attended with every favourable circumstances , & that nothi n g may o'ercloud the joy , which the event of it will produce to both you and Mr Dickenson -- may every bleſsi n g & every happineſs always attend you -- the little unknown & expected Bei n g already poſseſses a strong interest in the hea rt of your affectionate CMG -- remember me very kindly -- To Mrs Dickenson Courteen Hall Northamton Honble .
