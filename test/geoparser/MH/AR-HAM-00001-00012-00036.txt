My dear Miſs Hamilton I am a poor dumb Sufferer , for I dare not speak , or wd . have beg 'd you to have call 'd upon me ; I have so much Pain & Tenderness in my Mouth & Face , as well as Sore Throat , that I can hardly say I am better , thō I rather hope I am from the few Grains of James 's Powders I took last Night . My Complaint certainly is the most thorough Cold ever any poor Creature had . I hope your Pain in your face has not continued . Yrs . ever most Sincerely C.F . Miſs Hamilton
