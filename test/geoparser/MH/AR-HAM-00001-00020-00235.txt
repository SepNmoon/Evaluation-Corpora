71 , Queen Street 10 th - May 1809 My Dear Sister , I was delighted at receiving a Letter , purporting to have been written by Yourself , and which I really believe to have been so , though your Daughter certainly writes very like you . I must , however , do Louisa the justice to say that , I can read her writing without Spectacles -- not so , Yours . When I reached Doncaster , I heard of the death of my Brother Hunter , and at Newcastle of his Funeral being over . He died the 21 st . of April , perfectly resigned , and ready for the change . His two Sons were unfortunately absent in the Country , where they had been detained , to bury a Sister of their Father s , whose death was not communicated to him , so that they did not arrive till the day after his death , which took place , sooner than it was apprehended . He had gone to preach at Leith , on the Saturday afternoon , which turned out rainy and sleety . He walked home , and is supposed then to have caught cold , which brought on an Inflammation on his Lungs , which terminated his existence in six days . A better Man never lived . I consider him to be a public Loſs , in the Line of his Profession . Whatever he preached , he practised . He took an affectionate leave of such of his family , as were with him , and prayed for those who were absent , his friends , and parishioners . His eldest daughter , is very near the time of producing her first Child . He spoke very kindly to her , expreſsing his satisfaction that he left her united to a deserving man , & recommending it to her to leave his Room , & take care of herself , as her situation might be injured , by her being present at his diſsolution . His two Girls will have £3000 each , & h is younger Son , £4000 . The eldest Son , will have a Landed Estate of at least £1200 pr Ann . but , I imagine , it will be burdened with two , or perhaps three thousand pounds to make up the Money for the younger Children . The Cottagers of Glenburnie exhibit too true an account of that Claſs of people in this Country . I doubt , whether Jane Holman 's Book will have the effect of reforming them , first , because , the price will not admit of their purchasing it , & secondly , because they never will forgive her , for exposing their manners to the Englishers . As for You , I doubt much whether , you can understand the language ; but my friend Miſs Hamilton may aſsist as an Interpreter . Morrison is at Lady A. Clavering s in Hampshire , & a most intolerable Daudle she is . It w as an unlucky day , when She & her Husband came together . The reason he remains in Newgate is , that he will not condescend to tell the House of Commons , that he did wilfully prevaricate , and that they acted justly , in committing him for doing so . Therefore , he must remain there , as long as the Seſsion lasts . My Rib & c join me in everything kind , to You , your Hub , and Daughter . Best wishes to my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister , your faithful Friend , & Affecte- Brother Charles Clavering Edinburgh , Tenth May 1809 Napier Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Mrs- Dickenson .
