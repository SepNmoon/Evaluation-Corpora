Caldas June 23 d . 1781 My Dear Miſs —— I have not only a very kind Letter to thank you for to myself , but also for that directed to Mrs . Fielding , which came too Late by a few hours for her to receive , and was brought me by Mr . Fielding , who came into Lisbon just at the same time with the Packet , and consequently miſs 'd of her , which really was so mortifying a Circumstance that it quite disturbed the unexpected Pleasure his Arrival gave us ; She saild the 17 th . and he got into Lisbon the very next day . had they but deferr 'd their sailing for a few hours , she would have receiv 'd a Letter from him by the Packet informing her he was coming , and of course it would have stopt her going . I can not tell you how vext I feel about it , for I 'm sure it will be a sad Mortification to her when she knows it , as it was a very great one to him to find her gone . She had been Obliged to leave us above a fortnight before , that she might be ready at Lisbon to embark when the Packet saild . I hope in God she will get safe over , but shall feel very anxious till I hear of her Arrival , as the packets are always liable to be taken . I have not given her a Letter for you , as the seeing her herself , you could satisfy yourself of all particulars about us at the time she left us . I have charged her with my humble request to their Majesties for permiſsion to prolong my stay with my Son , till his health is more establish 'd , for he is too much of an Invalid still , to enable me to quit him without great anxiety , which I am sure their Goodneſs , ( of which I have had so much Experience ) will consider . I certainly have , thank God , great room to hope hope , Time and Care will restore him , but his strength returns slowly and has not of late made so much Progreſs as when first he began to recover ; I mean particularly with respect to his Limbs , which still continue to Swell very much , and tho ' he can take Exercise on Horseback ( which is a great Circumstance ) he is not Equal to walking , without uneasineſs to himself , and never can attempt it for any time together , his Pulse is rather too quick and he has a Disposition to be rather bloated and heated , that must require great Attention to be properly managed . his Appetite is very good rather too much so , and he sleeps generally well , his Spirits are also very equal , and he is always forming hopes , that we may compaſs a return to England , sooner than they Physical People prescribe . Could he be well enough for me to leave him with any Satisfaction or Comfort , I hope their Majesties will believe , nothing should detain me a Moment from my Duty , for I really suffer to think of the length of my Absence from the Happineſs , I should enjoy in performing it , but to leave him ill , and my Mind Under Anxiety and Uncertainty about him , I know would make me Unfit for any thing . Mr . Fielding told me how gracious their Majesties were , in their mention of our situation . I beg my Dear you will present my Duty and grateful Thanks for it , as well as to all the dear Princes and Princeſses . Mrs . Fielding is charged with Letters from me to their Royal Highneſses , which I hope she will have had the honor of delivering before this reaches you . I write by this same Packet to Miſs Hamilton , but beg you will charge yourself with kind remembrances from me to Every body else . I am in some fear that your next Letter may be directed to Mrs . Fielding and I of course shall not get it , as hers are all order 'd to be stopt at Falmouth now She is gone , if it should be so , and you recollect any thing in it that that was meant to me , I must beg you will be so good as to repeat it . My Health , which you so kindly enquire after , is vastly mended , and we have nothing to fear from heat , for contrary to all I had ever heard of Portugal , we have not yet experienced one Day so hot as by Mr- Fielding s Account you have had in England , and never hardly are without rain , and Northerly Winds . You will know from Mrs . Fielding all I could tell you about Caldas , so I will now only add how sensible I am of all your kind Anxieties about me and how Sincerely & Affectionately , I am , and ever shall be , Yrs . -- C. Finch Caldes July 4 th . 1781 My Dear Miſs —— , I am writing a few Lines by way of Duplicate , to a long Letter that I have this Moment finish 'd to you , to acquaint you of the distreſsing and Mortifying Intelligence we received last Night of the Mercury Packet being taken , that was carrying Mrs- Fielding to England , together with Mr . & Mrs. Graham ; they are thank God well , and landed at Vigo , in Spain . It was an American Privateer that took them , after a Chace of 12 hours , 2 Days after they sail 'd from Lisbon . Their Horror was great to find that they were fallen into such hands , but they proved very humane to them , the 26 th . of June they were landed at Vigo , from whence Mrs . Fielding wrote me a Letter that was 8 Days coming . You may imagine how distreſs 'd we are about it , but hope we shall be able to get her back here safe , all the Particulars I have sent you in my Letter that goes by sea , but least any Accident or delay should retard the Veſsel that carries it , I determin 'd to send this Duplicate by the Land Post . I have enclosed in my other Letter a Note to Miſs Hamilton , to say Mr . & Mrs. Graham & Miſs Cathcart were all well , that she might inform Ldy . Stormont of it , in case she had not receiv 'd any Intelligence about them . I am so hurried by the person that carries this to Lisbon to save the Land Post that I can only add my Duty and Love as due , and must refer you to my other Letter of this same Date , for every thing else from Yr- ever Afftne- CFinch Lord Winchelsea goes on as well as when I wrote last , but is slow in recovering Strength . I wrote to you & to Miſs Hamilton by a Packet that sail 'd the 1 st . of this Month , and had long before wrote 3 Letters to the Princeſses with which poor Mrs . Fielding was charged .
