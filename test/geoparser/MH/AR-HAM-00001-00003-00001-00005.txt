Taxal Novr : 12 th : 1772 My Dear Miſs Hamilton 'T is highly flattering to my Vanity , to see a young creature of your Age , so warmly soliciting a friendship with one of mine . but you were sincerely po d of it , before you ask 'd it . I have been particularly attach 'd to you ever since I had th e pleasure of your acquaintance . & if it ever is in my power to be of the least aſsistance to you by my advice , o f r any thing else , I shoud think my self extreamly happy . write to me then my dear friend , with the greatest freedom , be asured I shall always receive your letters with pleasure , & will give you my thoughts on whatever you propose to me , with truth & candour do n't be alarm 'd , if I tell you that your learning Latin is no secret , Mr Lawton mention 'd it to me , but without any reflections , as he has the highest opinion of you imaginable . there are few Wom e n who ought to be trusted with learning , but you are an exception . & whilst you can preserve that humility for wch : you are so remarkable . you may safely learn all the languages in the World . all I have to advise is t to give yourself up too much to it , do s tudy so as to hurt your health , remember that we are creatures form 'd for society , & that we must not so wholly converse with old Authors , as to neglect the chearful conversation of our acquaintance ; too severe an application to study naturally gives the mind too serious a turn , & indisposes it for the social duties of Life . let study therefore be your amusement , not your Occupation ; & never be asham 'd of improving your mind , till you find it raises your vanity , & leads you to look down with contempt on those , who either have not the same Capacity , or the same opportuni ti es of improving their minds with yourself . this I think will never be your case , & therefore I may safely advise you to go on . You ' l excuse the incoherency of this Letter when I tell you I have just lost a most favourite bosom friend . I will sometime attempt to give you her Character , & perhaps ( when we are so happy to meet ) shew you some of her L ette rs m y Spirits ( already weakend ) cou 'd ill b such a shock ; Your little friend is at School , & I hope imp I propose to have her home at Xmas , my other Girl is with me at present , she often puts me in mind of Miſs Hamilton , who I flatter myself she will be extreamly like in her dispositions . Jack is much obliged to you for your good opinion of him . Mr Dickenson is not at home or wou 'd have joyned me in sincere regards to Mrs : Hamilton & your self , I am Your affect friend S Dickenson Miſs Hamilton Northampton
