We were at H—— on Saturday M—— ye . owners of ye . place are very worthy honest , good sort of people , mais pas des plus eclairés , ni des plus agréables , had it not been for L——y G——n I know not what I ſhd .. have done , ye . place is very beautifully situated , but I am quite of yr . way of thinking that ye . House is a very enjoyable one tho ' not suitable to ye . place itself . On M—— M—— we went to Ca——m ye . place is beautiful beyond imagination , ye . House is just of ye same sort as ye . one I have just mentioned , L——y Cadogan looked exceſsively pretty , but that was her least merit that day , for she was all yt .. a Gentlewoman ought be , perfectly easy , civil , quiet , yet very lively , & chearful , & did ye . honors of her Houſe in ye . properest manner poſsible . T . M . we went to H——r where we found Ld ... & L——y B——n got into thr . new Houſe which is a very good one we had them to play at Cards with us in ye .

N . s . & Mrs .. H——r s Letters , you desir e my dearest Sister & Friend , to hear what I think of Francis Napier , 8th Lord Napier character , I think he is a very plain , open honest brave , & rather warm young man , however I do not say he is a bit too much upon this subject , he is just such a sort of Man as I shld .. like to attach to my ſelf & whom I hope hereafter to have about me . It is now late my Friend this Morning & I must dreſs for Breakfast . ye . next Letter ſhall be longer , I have not as yet shame upon me thanked you for yr . pretty Chain .
