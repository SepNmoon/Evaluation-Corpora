Your Dear letter this day week & postpon 'd writing to You till I could answer Your question respecting the drawing Rooms -- the next , will not be till Thursday the 25 th . & then you may reckon the fortnight Drawing Rooms . dating ym . from ye . 25 th -- I am quite delighted that You can send me so good an account of Your health ( for I know You never deceive me ) . I have seen Hero -- & flatter myself I am in good Odour with her ; I waited on her ye . 1 st . Eveg . I was at liberty -- and last Tuesday Morng we went together to Walker s Lecture & in the Eveg . She carried me & Miſs Thursby to Brislaws ( these two Genius 's being here for a few days -- Mrs . & ye . 2 Miſs Crewes were also of both these Parties -- do You know ym . ? I did not see enough of them to form even an Outline of their Characters Hero talk 'd of You but not one word drop 'd of Your coming to her & I did not dare venture the question . What does Your Father say to all the changes in the Ministry ? I can not help thinking but that they are agreeable to the People I live with ; & Ld . Shelborne , I pronounce is already a great in favor ite You reproach me for not having congratulated You on finding Your Pocket Book -- indeed I was vastly glad when I heard it -- I will endeavour -- but I do not promise , that I will procure You the hair You wish to have ; remember , that you must on no account boast of having this invaluable Treasure in Your poſseſsion . Pray what are Your Studies this Summer , & what book 's of amusement have You -- I have just finished Potters translation of Euripides -- the 1 st . Vol . only , ye . 2 d . I believe is not yet published -- I wish we could have read it together , I think ye . same paſsages would have equally pleased each -- I have just begun some books on Natural History & hope I shall acquire some Knowledge in my favorite studies of this kind -- particularly too as Monr . de 'Luc is come to settle at Windsor to whom I can apply to explain wt . I do not comprehend . & c . I have seen advertised another Novel by Miss Burney who wrote Evelina -- I shall like to see it for I think her first production was a wonderful proof of genius for that Kind of Writing . if it is true that she was so young & had no aſsistance -- it is call 'd Cecilia & is in 5 Vol : s . I think it might be a good lounging book for You at Horton . -- pray get it & tell me how You like it .

Give my love to Is : I hope to hear she has lost ye pain in her side . let me know if you have franks for me
