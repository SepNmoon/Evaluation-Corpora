I rejoice in the thoughts of seeing you in a short time -- what a naughty Miranda have you been in never having taken the least notice of my Letter from M D -- but I forgive you -- if I were not very generous I could not . Mrs : Glover , bids me give her Love & tell you that she is glad her Dove is returned , although alone . I am never alone for I am continually with your Mamma , or Mr : & Mrs : Glover , how happy should I be , could you be with us . Mrs. Hamilton says , you have sent her a Draft which she had no occasion for , she had received the money before , & she must take more money shortly , she desires that you will write to Mr : Leathenstone -- for the money , & to your Uncle f to desire that the Land may be let -- & she thinks he should be informed of it Leonidas desires his Love , & never forgets his toast -- it is very hard that we can not have any pleasure , but that of thinking of you & of drinking your Health . Adieu give me a Line -- be a≈øsured of my constant attention to your Mother & of the Affection with which I am Yours , Anna Maria James Street Wednesday n afternoon
