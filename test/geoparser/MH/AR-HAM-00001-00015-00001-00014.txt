Horton August 24 th 1786 Why do I never hear from you my very dear Friend ? Have you forgot that I exist , either for myself or you ? Have I ceased to be anything to you , or have you chose to imagine that you no longer interest me ? I answered your last letter which I received I believe in May , or before , immediately -- & since that , I have never heard from , nor even of you but from Lady Wake whom a variety of unpleasant circumstances have prevented me seeing but very little of -- When first I came down here which was in the middle of June I was in daily expectation of a Letter -- Indeed nothing could equal my diſsappointment in not finding you at Courteenhall , except the constant ill luck whic h has invariably attended my wishes on this subject -- my Brother told me he had seen you well , Lady Wake whom I found very low myself gave me the same comfortable account of you , she herself seemed to have lost all comfort with you -- I was not surprised at her having felt your loſs greatly -- her Daughter ill too -- I hear she is still indifferent -- I am going there tomorr ow to see her , to inquire after you , and to procure your direction for this letter . I will now continue my account of myself this summer -- a few Days after I arrived here we had Company whom I could not leave provoked and mortified by your silence I then intended to have written to you , when received the news of Miſs Charlotte Stuart 's short illneſs & sudden Death almost in one letter -- this was a shock to me , both on my own accoun t & that of the miserable Family she had left , which I have at this minute far from recovered -- I my first thought was to fly to them -- & upon the repeated sollicitations of Ly Lonsdale , Ly Louisa , & Mr Stuart himself , ( for I wished to be aſsured that it would be as agreeable to them as to me ) I set out for Richmond leaving all that was dear & agreeable to me , here -- the scene of misery & the various expreſsions of it at the Lodge , were what I can not describe & shall I think never forget -- Mr Stuart s affliction was the most affecti n g & heart rending thi n g I ever saw -- my intention was to have staid 4 Days & brought them back with me here -- but no persuasion could make Mrs Stuart move -- I could not leave them -- I staid three weeks there without ever stirring out of the House above three times -- I grew so thin , so ill , that when I returned here , I was mecconnoiſsable . never slept one night the whole time I was there -- & as for appetite I have none at this minute -- after I had been weepi n g the whole with Mrs Stuart , Mary ( her eldest Daughter who is exceſsively attached to me ) used to sit by my bed side till 2 in the morni n g talking over all the horrid circumstances of her Sister 's Death -- with this horrible images , I used to fall asleep , but in my sleep they still followed me , till I woke agitated & unrefreshed -- on the 11 th inst I returned here with Mr and Mrs Stuart & their Son & Daughter -- during their stay here I never left them a minute -- & I have the comfort & satisfaction of seeing them all infinitly better both in Health & spirits -- they left me yesterday morning & Mr Stuart ( who has all his life bore the character & the appearan ce of an unfeeling hard heart ) burst into tears when he embraced me , and said God bleſs you , I shall never forget what you have done for me and mine ! How he is altered -- how softened , how improved -- never swears never gives way to paſsions ! I was to have gone up for to day 's Drawing , but received an expreſs from Windsor to say that there would be none on account of Princeſs Elisabeth 's dangerous illneſs -- my Sister went with Mrs Stuart & stays three weeks with her -- I am now thank God left to myself & to a state of peace & tranquility I have been a stranger to for some time past -- the first use I make of my liberty is to write to you my very dear Friend -- for Godsake writte me fully -- & tell me that you love me -- I am sure I love you most sincerely & tenderly -- & am most truly interested about you -- you see how I have been prevented writing before -- my head has been turned & my heart & my spirits oppreſsed -- the weather has been miserable -- I shall be here till this Day fortnight & afterwards at Ly Carlisle 's Putney Lodge -- but direct to St James 's -- I go one day to the Races -- here Wednesday -- God bleſs you -- my dear dear Friend -- write soon if you love me -- remember me very kindly to Mr Dickenson -- my F . & Mother are well -- Bell only so so -- I mean to allud e only to the reestablishment of my Health -- I am the greatest Physician & Apothecary du canton & all the poor come to me from far to be cured -- this is my employment wth musick & a little reading -- I shall read more now I am alone adieu -- once more God bleſs you -- To Miſs Gunning at Taxal near Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
