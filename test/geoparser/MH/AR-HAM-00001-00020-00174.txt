Wilton Lodge 21 st . June 1802 My Dear Sister , Three days ago , I wrote you a long Letter , and directed it to Leighton House , supposing that You would have been at home again , before this time . It will , of course , find you out . Yesterday your Letter from Birch Hall arrived here . As to your Miſs , I will never believe any reports of her illneſses , having been convinced , by ocular demonstration , of the Absurdity of imagining that a person , so robust as she is , can be in danger from Nervous complaints . Pray , dont let your Old Women Doctors terrify You , for I say they are a parcel of Geese . Mr. Dickenson Senr . , I will not say so much for . At his time of Life , a certain Event must be looked for . I trust , however , that Mr. D. Junr . will not suffer in his health from his attention to his Father . Adieu . All here join me in Love and best wishes ( although chiefly unknown ) to You and all your Concern . Ever My Dear Sister Your Affecte . Brother Napier Hawick , Twenty First June 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Birch Hall HAWICK Napier .
