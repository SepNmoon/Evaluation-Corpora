Park Street 110 -- 29 May 1787 my Dear Honble . Mrs. Murray I am sorry , it has not been in my power before now , to have answer 'd Your last ; which gave me much concern , to find the melancholy Scene , You was engaged in -- hope , the Effects will not have proved bad , for poor Mrs. Dickenson ; who just recovering , with the aſsistance of Bath ; was ill prepared , for such a shock : I hope to hear , if His Father recovers , that his intellects are restored , for such dreadfull falls , often occasion complaints , in the Brain ; that deprive themselves , & friends of comfort . -- I long to know how You are ; and the smiling Mr. Dickenson ; who as yet , I hope has no cause to frown by this , You see ; I supose her quite well -- as pain , is the only thing that can as yet alter her good humor -- We are now packed up , for Stanley , for which place we shall sett out in the course of the week -- so You will be so kind , to direct under cover to Louisa , as he will know , where to forward them -- My Sister , I have the pleasure to tell You , is of our party ; to the surprise I believe , of many of her acquantance : who have no idea , of any thing in Scotland , but barren ground , frost , and snow ; -- but , the amendment they are obliged to acknowledge , in her health & spirits ; prevent the outcry , they would otherwise make . I need only tell You , she was at the Rehearsal ( Westminster Abbey ) on friday ; and is gone there again to day : and dines out , after to prove she is well . I wish some good wind , would blow You north , am sure , You would be pleased with the country , and inhabitants : and find , a hearty , & friendly welcome , at Stanley ; a comfortable Snug peninsula that only boasts , of the real pleasures of life , without its shew , or Extravagance -- After much Joy , often comes sorrow : every body , has been crouding to court , to enjoy the pleasure of the reconciliation ; and , that no sooner over , than the Prince taken dangerously ill : made a general mourning , aprehended . he was siezed , at three oclock in the morning , at Gen : Murray s Ball ; and obliged to go home : , tho ' he intended to have gone to the Duchess of Gordon s. -- You may think it late for that , but the fashon is for those parties to end with a Breakfast ; as five , seven , or even eight in the Morning : of course 3 or 4 is quite in time -- Lady Gideon , is again disapointed of being a Bride -- she is , they say inconsolable She went for the holidays , to Lady Augusta Murray who you must know by fame -- it was , to the surprise of every body that she was there -- but then she met with Mr. Macnamarra : and , she made a conquest ; all her friends thought a great one , but , after having accepted his proposal , & told it as a certainty ; they , have found out : he can only settle 70 , for every 1000 , and as she has a very small fortune : of course , there could not be enough to live on -- so now , they are obliged to go round , & notifye in form : that the match is quite off -- a foolish buſsineſs ! -- had he been a good sort of Young Man ; I can not help thinking , if inclination was equal ; on ten thousand a Year they might very well save for joynture , and Children , as Mr. Sturt need not live like a Duke -- but , as his Character , is very Wild & Drunken ; she may be better off without him -- her Sister Mr. Sturt , is come out this winter , ready for a Bride : tho ' not yet presented . -- Susan , has married one of the richest fortunes to be had ; a neice of the Ld . Aldbourough -- Dowr . Dutchſs : of Chandois , is going to marry a very good one ; Lord Compton . her father gives 25 thousd : down , and in all probability , she will have a great deal more ; as the Familly is so rich . Miſs Smith now Mr. Charteris , has made an awkward sort of Bustle ; about his seat , and calling himself too soon a Lord , but by all acts . he is very happy with it . tho ' some say , his title will be disputed , and others , his Estate which is worse . -- My Sister , joyns with Lord Elco and self , and best wishes to Dear Capt : M . pray present all our compts to Mrs. Dickenson and believe me Yours Sincerely Mr. D——
