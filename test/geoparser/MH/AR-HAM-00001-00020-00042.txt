Welwyn , 7 th . Decr- 1780 . Your disobedience astonishes me -- Pray Miſs did not I command you to write to me ? Are my orders to be treated in this manner ? Am I to write Ten letters for one ? In this little dirty Village , I have little else to do than read letters , and you forsooth wo n't write any . I expect to hear from you immediately , for I have a packet to transmit to You , which I received this morning . It is from Lady Hen : Hope , wanting government to aſsist a Lady in distreſs . I had some conversation with her upon the subject before I left Scotland & promised to do every thing in my power to forward the application . She suggested tell send ing the Case to the Q . but by sending it to You , it is not my intention to desire You to ask a favour , only to put me in such a way of doing it as you think may make the request effectual . Send me a frank for Yourself & I will inclose the Packet , just as I received it . Lady C . is in good health . I saw her yesterday and dine with her tomorrow . I told her the conversation I had with the Q . about her , which pleased her wonderfully -- I am at length settled in my Lodgings . My Landlord drives a Stage Coach & I am now sitting in my Parlour , with a Child squalling on one side of me , a Hog stye on the other and a Blacksmiths shop in front . My only amusements are Eating Drinking , Sleeping , Drilling Six Men , Scolding my Serjeants , & letter scribbling . I mention not reading , for alas my library is small -- Adieu . I remain ever Your affect- Brother N——
