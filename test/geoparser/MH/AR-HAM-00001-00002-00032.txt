11 th : Decbr : 1790 Buxton My Dear Mary Tho I am full of pain to day yet I am better , as I think my complaint will prove Rheumatism which is to be sure bad enough , -- it varies about and is in different parts of my body , so that I hope it will-not fix any where -- I must confeſs that I have been very uneasy from a supposition that it proceeded from the repeated hurts in my back -- but now I dont think that is the Case -- Wm . came as we were at Dinner -- as soon as I could I gave yr- Letter to my Father -- from his Mucles I augured no pleasant communication -- after reading yr- letter he said -- “ he thought it was not a proper Connection ” he said nothing against Cr which makes me hope that he will comply with their Wishes -- they may be aſsured of having a very warm Advocate in me as I am flattered by the Connection and approve of it , as far as I can judge of Cr . s Character -- You are too precipitate in expecting an immediate Ansr . from a Parent on a Subject of so much consequence to the happiness of his Child -- After saying that he “ saw it yesterday ” , he took up a Newspaper read it twice over & then took his hat & stick & walked out -- I make no doubt but he will consent but he must have Time to consider of it -- he saw perfectly yesterday how matters were going on & slept well after it which is a very good sign -- he mentioned it at dinner about 5 minutes before Wm . came -- I am happy that Sarah & You should know each other perfectly -- as it is not probable that my Father will return soon I shall send Wm . away -- I would not have Cr . come here -- when I have agreeable News to send , I shall dispatch it immediately -- Grandpapa almost cried at Louisa s distreſs last night -- but I found it quite neceſsary to send her home , as she prevented both of us from sleeping -- Addio -- My ever dear Mary -- If Cr . P . marries my Sister , may they be as tenderly attached & love each other as entirely as we do -- Then a great addition of happineſs will accrue to yr . most Affe . Husband JD I insist upon Peggy s staying constantly at home & that she shall give a months notice & quit her place as I am satisfied that she does not go to New mill from a Love to his Children -- Mrs. Dickenson
