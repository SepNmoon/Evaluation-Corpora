Dear Sir , I am extremely obliged to you for your kind remembrance in sending me a brace of Grouse , which I received on Monday last in very good condition . We propose quitting our House in Bedford Square on Saturday the 26 th . of this Inst . having sold it to Mr. Thos . Hankey a Banker in the City ; we are to remove to n o . 248 in Oxford Street , contiguous to which I am building a House upon a very fine lot of Ground which stands to the South & commands a most magnificent view of Hyde Park . This when completed will serve for both a Town & Country House & will at the same time be a much leſs remote situation than Bedford Square . I beg you will remember us all most affectionately to Mrs. Dickenson with whom I condole very sincerely on the loſs of her excellent Friend Mrs. Jackson ; I know I ought to have wrote to her upon the occasion , but those are subjects I am inclined to avoid , knowing how little can be said to mitigate real affliction . My Son is in perfect health & amazingly grown , we expect him this Evening in Bedford Square with a large Squadron of Boys to celebrate his Birth Day , having now enterd his 16 th . year . Mr. Chauvet is very well satisfied with him , & he is in general much liked by his Companions . Lady Stormont is still in in Kent at a House of Ld . North 's , & I am told she is not very well ; her Br . Col. Cathcart arrived a few days ago from India , & I am told upon no frivolous busineſs , he looks ill & much thinner than when he left us 18 months ago ; when I saw him yesterday at Lady Warwick 's , my surprise was in deed very great ; he was 6 Months on his paſsage so that he cou 'd not be informed of Ld . Cornwallis 's Appointment , if he had , I do not know whether it wou 'd have prevented his return . Next Week I expect to be in a Scene of some confusion removing my Effects and my Family to my new Habitation Adieu Dr . Sir believe me with great regard Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Bedford Square August 18 th . 1786 . P.S . I am not yet prepared upon the busineſs of the Aſsignment of the Heretable Bond , which I have sent to Scotland . Honbl . Ld . Hamilton August 1786
