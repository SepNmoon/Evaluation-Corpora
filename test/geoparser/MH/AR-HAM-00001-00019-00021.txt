Parts copied E G A Canterbury Octbr . 26 th - 1772 I was favored with My dearest Mary 's letter of the 22 d instant last night , and am extremely ſorry to find you have been so very ill , but I thank God you are now so well again , Fevers are a very dangerous thing so I hope you 'll take great care for the future not to catch Cold especially in this Seaſon of the year , as a Cold got now com̅only holds all Winter , but is a Companion I do n't deſire for my dear Girl . I make no doubt but Mary 's illneſs made Mrs Hamilton indisposed , but now as Mary s well so I hope she is so too , please my best Compliments to her . I think it will be very proper for you to write your Uncle Cathcart & congratulate him on his ſafe arrival once more in Great Britain , & I think you ought to make ſome apology for being so long a doing it . its always worth every body 's trouble to keep well with their connexions , especially a young Lady who 's dispoſition is so willing at all times to do right as I know My dear Miſs Hamilton is . its not in my Power My dearest Girl to get to London even to meet you which I can aſsure you would be the greatest inducement I know off , but I am at present tyed by the foot in ſuch a manner taking care of a parcel of Boys that I am heartily fatigued every day , & this must be the Case all this Winter whither I will or not , so must pospone viſiting the Great City to April or May next , then indeed I should be extremely happy to meet you , perhaps that may be your time but we shall always know one anothers motions by letter I am so sencible of your judgement in every thing that I am quite convinced the colouring you have given yr late & constant Partner is not a bitt too high tho I do n't understand what you mean by the difference of your ages -- as I dont find that you are above five Hundred years older than he is , speaking in the antediluvian stile , tho I find ſome young Lady 's can add a Compliment in a genteel way when they please , the Hook was extremely well baited , but my dear Girl I am not quite Gudgeon enough to swallow it , tho I must own that ſuch a Pill from you was double gilt & would have been eaſier taken then from any other Lady & with more pleaſure as I know none I have so good an opinion off and of whos Friendship I so much deſire and prize , and I own I flatter myself that I do at present enjoy ſome of it , & it shall be my constant study to encrase it as much as poſsible so I hope my dear Mary I do n't deceive myself in thinking you are so good as give me a little of that ſame thing so very seldom to be mett with in this world -- I rejoice greatly the Kitten bears her great loſs with Christian patience I was afraid their departure wtout her might have have given a shock to a frame so delicate as might have brought on a Co m n sumption which I know would have effected you greatly . I can aſsure you Mrs- Litchfield told you truth about suckling Children by the Blacks in America they likeways do the ſame in both the East & West Indies so that deceit & treachery are com̅only most happily blended in most , if not all the Americans , East , & west . indians both Men and Women tho the Men are not given so much up to Hypocrisy as the Women as I have been told , but much more to abuse than the women tho I dont believe much about the transmigration of Souls yet I am afraid had the Crocodile one or the Serpent we would find much wrose ones amonst the human race they are at least kind & good to one another wh I am ſorry to ſay is not the case wt the people of this age as ill nature , scandell , & backbiteing seem to be the Characteristic of this world especially , amonst those in high Life -- I heard yesterday from the Abbey all well & I shall you may be sure make your apology tho ' I dont think you ought to wait for one being made your illneſs is apology enough for any reaſonable person & those that wo n't be content with that one ought not to be wrote too at all ; however I can aſsure you , your letters will always be agreeable at the Abbey & on the faith of my word write & then you 'll be convinced that I am only writing you truth & on second thoughts I think its best for me not to say any thing about it but let you & Mrs Napier clear your own accounts by yourselves . I am extremely obliged to My dearest Mary for her kind inquirys about my health its much better than when I left you & if the shortneſs of my breathing wd go away I might ſay I never was in better health & spirits then now , but it still continues which makes me unable to walk about so much as I ought to do , & of consequence my whole exercise is on Horseback & that can be but only once per day , now were was I able to walk in the afternoon wd I am convinced do me a great deal of good , however I thank God I am so well , a few months ago I had little reason to expect ever to have been so well as I find myself at present & I hope if I get over this winter as I am , a few weeks next year at Buxton will make me a new Man again where I hope to be happy in the Company of my dear Girl I am not particularly acquaint wt the Officers now of the Seventh Dragn - except for Col . Bland , tho I have heard that they are ſome very pretty young Folks amonst them & will be a great acquiſition to a Country aſsembly in dancing with the Miſses . as for any Account of them was I much acquainted with them I hope you would not deſire as I make it a rule never to give or take a Character to any body as I think people 's behaviours only should recom̅end them to the different places they go too , & I am sorry to ſay I have seen Officers very well uſed in a town who abused the people ( for no other reason than that they had been civil to them ) after they marched away -- I wish I could see so long a letter from my dearest Miſs Hamilton & an answer as quick returned however I wont complain you are a good Girl & I shall always be happy in receiving yours whither long or short Adieu My dearest Mary believe I am & that none can be more your most faithfull & most afft yours -- Wm.N : --
