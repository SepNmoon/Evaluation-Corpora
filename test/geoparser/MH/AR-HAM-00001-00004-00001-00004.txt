Dear Miſs . Hamilton , It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear from yourself that you are so well satisfied with your new situation ; I make no doubt that you will continue to merit every attention that is shewn you , by your prudent conduct . I am much obliged to you for the deference you are pleased to expreſs for any advice coming from me , which I shall think hereafter unnecessary to offer us I now look upon you as perfectly established in the right track , to which I hope nothing is wanting but perseverance to conduct you to such a situation as you cou 'd wish . As I now look upon myself as settled in Ireland for the remaining period of my life , I am laying out a considerable sum of money for me , upon a small Estate that I purchased some time ago about three miles from Dublin , the situation is remarkably beautiful , and I have nearly completed the House , which from a very bad one will with the additions that I have made to it be sufficient to accommodate me tolerably . I have but very small expectations of advancement in my Profeſsion not having Friends zealous enough to aſsist me . I have continued One , and Twenty years upon the same Living , situated in a part of the World that I can never be reconcil 'd to , in a most remote northern Part of Ireland in the midst of a Colony of Presbiterian Independants , but I must not permit myself to proceed into any further detail of my own situation in which there is nothing interesting or satisfactory . As you did not mention your Mother , I conclude she is well , I am sure I most sincerely congratulate her in the happineſs she must enjoy in seeing you in so respectable a situation , cou 'd I be of any service to her she may be aſsured of my best inclinations and that there is no remembrance remaining of past disagreeable circumstances . I can not expect to entertain you with news from this place as every thing interesting comes to us from your side ; this is Parliament winter here , & the busineſs is now begun and the Patriots prepared as usual to harangue for the good of the Country & their own emolument . Mrs. Hamilton and Mrs. Stratford desire to be affectionately remember 'd to you , I expect during the course of the next month to be favour 'd with a title that will remind me that I must here after rank myself in the Claſs of Veterans Adieu . Dear Miſs Hamilton believe me ever Yours Most faithfully & Affectionly Frederick Hamilton Gloucester Street November 3 d 1777
