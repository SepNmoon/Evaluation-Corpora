I fear with you he came here too quick -- God knows we are apt to blame second causes which are often Innocent . I wish I could say more but can not with truth Recovery must be gradual but dont be Anxious for I can not write often & believe no news to be good News -- our best wishes ever attend yr Mama & You be ever asured of My Affect & that I ever am Sincearly Yours & c & c M A Napier Augst 11 th 1773
