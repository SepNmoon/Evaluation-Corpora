My Dear Miſs Hamilton I thank you for all you r kind Enquiries & Wishes about my Dear Mrs Feilding . She was this Morning we hoped in a way to be better , but in the attempt this Evening to take her up to have her bed made , I have suffer 'd more than I can express by seeing her Weakneſs so great , & her having had 3 fainting fits , one a terrible long one , & a great return of heat . She is now got to bed again & seems quiet thō not asleep . God knows how the Night will paſs . Yrs . Ever C.Finch near Eleven To Miſs Hamilton
