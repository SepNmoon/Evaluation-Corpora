My Dear Sir , I feel the most bitter regret that on the first notice of this impending calamity I did not immediately come to London where I might have been at hand to have administerd in person every poſsible consolation to the supreme object of my affection & to have given her my parting embrace . In this afflicting situation , no other Person coud answer every neceſsary object . I am really shock 'd to perceive that her medical assistants may not have received regular satisfaction for their attendance , for I supposed that there might have been a sufficient fund in my dear Daughter 's hands under the management of Mrs. Mann , who it seems was her Cash keeper , & to whom I referrd you to answer every exigence that might occur till I sent her a fresh supply , which I aſsure you has hitherto largely anticipated her wants ; where as to my great confusion her Physicians have been left to their own conclusions from whence their remuneration was to come , I beg therefore that you will inform them with my respects that due attention shall be paid to that object . As my Daughter has been suddenly struck by the hand of Providence , she has been prevented from communicating her neceſsities to me shoud any have really existed , & on my part I have always felt great satisfaction in anticipating her wants . Mann shou 'd have communicated to you what she had in her hands belonging to Mrs. Holman , had she done this a supply wou 'd have been sent to you in time to have answer 'd every purpose It is my particular desire that every medical expence shou 'd be forthwith accounted for according to each Person 's attendance . It can be no inconvenience to me as you perceive the money can be remitted at a day 's notice . So sudden a demand cou 'd not have been foreseen , I therefore can not reproach myself with having neglected my dear Daughter , who has been render 'd doubly so to me from the misfortunes she has suffer 'd . I beg the favor that you will call upon Mrs. Mann from me to lay before you the state of Mrs. Holman s cash Acct . with her & to desire her to deliver the Balance into your hands . Tho ' I have a very high opinion of her integrity , yet this was a confidence that Mrs. Holman knew I did not recommend ; her argument was the trifling advantage to be made of the interest of the money which Mrs. Mann negotiated for her . A circumstance you will be surpriz 'd at , my poor Daughter was by no means accurate in keeping an Acct . of the money I gave her & not long since on my remonstrating with her upon this subject , she acknowledged her fault and gave me perfect satisfaction . Your goodneſs of heart has drawn upon you & Mrs. Dickenson more trouble than you were aware of ; proceed I intreat you to the end of the Tragedy , & let me owe the weight of my obligations to no other Persons . I was formerly a volunteer in your service , & have ever since enjoy 'd the pleasing reflexion that I acquitted myself with propriety , in this you can never fail when you are guided by that heavenly maxim do as you wou 'd be done by . No one woud hardly give credit to to the horrid treatment I have met with from Mr. Holman ; he is to be guarded against as a Person capable of every thing that is bad & you may be aſsured he will not fail showing himself on the first opportunity by laying claim to Mrs. Holman s property when she is no longer in his way . What he may lay a legal claim to I shall not oppose but Mrs. Mann will make but a feeble opposition to his violence & shoud avoid all intercourse with him . With my best Compts . to Mrs & Miſs Dickenson , I remain My dear Sir , Your faithful & obliged humble Servant Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St . Bath May 30 th . 1810 . I was extremely surprised by the Contents of this letter as I informed Mr Hamilton in my letter yesterday that Mrs Holman had plenty of money -- Somebody must have written to him on the subject .
