Monday Morng . 8 oclock 11 th . Octbr . 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest , Sister Friend , my Miranda , I flatter myself I shall be able to clear myſelf now of yt . imputation which you accused me of y——y when you asked me in yr . last dear Billet , why I wld .. force Mr .. R—— to tell me what was said in my favor ; to be sure what paſsed before yr . eyes bore very much yt .. appearance but I do aſsure you by what really was ye . case , I think I shall be able to clear myself totally in yr . opinion . Before I can come to explain this I must resume a little higher . Do not you remember my dearest friend , in yr . last but one , you ſaid to me you was sorry for my sake yt .. I was going to make a short ſtay at W——or for yt . I got into low Company there , whether you mean t by yt .. , yt .. I made myself too free among ye . Servants , or yt . I got into bad company by hunting ; I know not but supposing , you meant either of these , or both , I hope I shall be able to answer ym .. all in a manner most to yr . satisfaction . As to ye . first of yese , ever dearest Miranda I can not but confeſs I have lowered myſelf much by familiarizing myself to too great a degree with ye . Servants , & especially with yt .. little Devil W—— R—— however since what you mentioned to me I have kept him more within bounds that I ever did before in ye . whole course of my life , but for ye future I solemnly promise you here my dearest , dearest , dearest Sister yt . I will in this , follow yr . Preecepts , as I hope I shall every other you give me to ye . utmost of my power , & yt . I will never again lower demean myſelf either to ym .. or to any other low Company . As to ye affair of hunting , I ride always among a set of Gentlemen , very worthy good sort of people , one of whom my Father I believe wishes me to be particularly acquainted with , his name is Nevil he is Son to a Mr .. Nevil who was under Secretary of State in ye late King s Reign & who now lives at Billingbear , this young man is in ye . Berks : Militia , & is a very plain , honest civil , wellbehaved , polite young Man , & will be Heir to a very great fortune , ye a great part of which he will in all probability receive from Sr. John & La-y Griffin upon ye . whole he is a very good sort of young Man & indeed I am very glad of having such an acquaintance not a friend Another of these Gentlemen is a Mr. Lisle ( I do not know how exactly he spells his name ) a very civil sort of a man also , he is Brother in law to Ld .. Cholmondeley : this Gentleman is a very I have conversed very little with , & know very little of him , except this Character which every body yt .. know any thing of him give him . Now then , that I have brought you acquainted with this Gentleman , I shall be able to proceed with my defense with regard to my forcing W. R to tell me what was said to my praise & in my favor . W—— R—— is much acquainted with this Gentleman , I told you he made him a present of a Horse in ye . most genteel way imaginable . Well then ye . first day of ye . Sport this Mr. Lisle , followed me very closely thro'out ye . whole of ye day , without my knowing either his name or his Person , he observed I supposed how eager I was after ye . Sport , & how shocked my Nature was at ye . death of ye poor Animal , & at ye . different emotions which appeared in my Countenance upon yt .. occasion . A Day or two after he sent W—— R—— a Letter to tell him I believe yt .. he had sent him his horse . You must know yt .. I generally go & lay my whip & Hat before I go out a riding in ye . Servants Breakfast Room , there , accordingly as I was going out of ye . Room , after I had been to fetch ym .. away -- W—— R entreated of me to stop ped a moment , for he said he had something to shew me upon which he pulled out a Letter , ( by his manner he wanted to insinuate he had received it from you ) in which he desired me to read a Sentence upon which he laid his Finger , which was first great compliments encomiums on my Horsemanship , & on ye . spirit I had shewn thro'out ye . Day , as well as great Compliments on ye . goodneſs of heart I had shewn ; after I had read this sentence he snatched ye . Letter out of my Hands so yt . I could not see any other part of it , not even ye . signature . Upon going up Stairs you heard me preſs W—— R—— but it was merely to know ye . Gentleman 's name , which turned out to be this very Mr .. Lisle I have been speaking to you of , yt . is ye whole & sole of ye . case ; by which I fancy you will think me so much to blame as you did . I did not feel my ſelf flatter 'd by these praises , as my Miranda , when I receive ym . from you . I then think myſelf exalted b a bove any earthly Potentate . It is now so near 8 o clock yt . I must bid you Adieu . Adieu then dearest dearest , dearest Siſter , Friend , Miranda , may you be under ye especial care of ye Almighty & of his Angels , & may you e ver find from yt .. Allbenevolent Being ye . rewards which your . Virtues so much deserve , I am & ever shall be yr . sincerely affectionate Brother , & Friend Palemon , toujours de même P.S . Why wld .. my friend send me ye . Rose Color if she likes ye . Brown best , I send you ym . back again looked at ym . again , & chuse that wh . you yrself like best , for it will be most agreable to me , be plain with me my dearest Miranda , for I will not wear ye one you like least . A . A . A . toujours chére . I thank you much for yr Letters , I like ym .. much , I can not say more to you at present but yt .. you are dearer to me now than ever . A . A .
