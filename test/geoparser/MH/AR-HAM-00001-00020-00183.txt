38 , S t . James 's Street My Dear Sister , I do not intend to obey your directions , by sending in your name to enquire after Lady Hamilton , because , as it is well known that You are not in Town , it can not be expected that such Meſsages should be sent , and as to myself , I never had any acquaintance with her Ladyship whatever , neither did I ever see her , except in her Carriage . If I hear anything about Sir William 's burial & c I will certainly inform You ; but , I fear , except , I can pick up that sort of information among the Atholls , I am not likely to learn it elsewhere , not having dined with the Cathcarts since the Week after I came to Town , and not having yet dined with Robert Greville . I was to have dined with the latter , last Sunday , but the Party was put off on account of Sir William 's illneſs . This season of Devotion comes very opportunely for composing my Mind , and preparing me to submit to the final Decisions against me , in Ireland . I am told that my Adversaries throw out , that their claims against me , for what I had received of Mrs- Naper 's property , & for Costs on a 17 Years Suit & c. & c . will amount to six or seven thousand Pounds . I do not think , this Statement is correct ; but , I would chearfully give four , to receive a Discharge in full . I doubt very much , whether it will be poſsible for me to take your Road home , as the Cathcarts , the Sedleys at Stapleford Hall , & their Father at Nuttal Temple , could not be paſsed by , without calling on them , and that would occasion more delay , than I can bring my mind to bear , being most anxious to get to my Wife & Children the moment I can escape from hence . This busineſs coming on Me , when absent from Maria , has been doubly distreſsing . But , I trust , we shall all be supported by a Gracious Providence , and enabled to meet every difficulty , this Life subjects us too with calmneſs & resignation . I am glad to hear that Louisa is better . Give my Love to her , to Mr- Dickenson , & best wishes to my Countrywoman . Nothing is known as yet , about Peace & War . Parliament adjourned yesterday , to the 19 th - Inst- . Adieu , My Dear Sister , Ever Your Affecte .
