daughter of Rev Fredk Jane Hamilton afterwards Mrs Holman Portman Square London . December 27 th : - My dear Mrs : Dickenson , I am afraid you begin to suspect me of having forgotten my Promise of writing to you . I deferr 'd it purposely , till I cou 'd tell you of my being got into this House , which happen 'd above a Fortnight ago . Our unsettled State must be my Excuse for not writing more immediately . -- Before I proceed any farther , I must return many Thanks , in my Father and Mother 's Name , as well as my own , to you and Mr : Dickenson , for a very fine Hare that we received from you the other Day . Do n't however , fancy that it reminded me of writing to you , for I aſsure you I had been talking of doing so , for some Time . -- We like this House extremely ; its Situation is very fine . We inhabit the Parlours for the present , the Drawing-Room not being as yet , quite finish 'd . I think that when once we become entirely settled , we shall find ourselves as comfortably lodged as ever we were . I hope your little Daughter is well -- I understand she is a remarkably clever , and agreeable Child . I shall be very glad when you have an Opportunity of introducing this little Cousin to me . Tell me whether there is any Chance of it in the next Spring . London is very pleasant at that Season , if it were but convenient for you to come . I think I am a graceleſs Creature , to have written so far , without enquiring after my Brother . I hope he is quite well , and will be so old- fashion 'd as to wish him , in all our Names , a merry Christmas , a happy New-Year , and a great many Returns of them . I beg you , Mr : Dickenson , and little Louisa , will accept of the same good Wishes from us . -- I suppose you have a hundred ingenious Devices for making long Christmas Evenings short . You used to have a famous Collection of Riddles , which , for that Kind of Purpose , often prove an Aſsistance . -- I have not been at the Play this Winter , owing to the Busineſs of our moving ; but I hope I shall go soon . I continue to amuse myself very much , with Music . I have been once at the Opera , and was very well entertained . Lady Stormont is come to Town . Her Daughter is much improved -- she is really a very pretty little Girl . The Boys are likewise , grown , and improved . This is expected to be a remarkably gay Season among the fine People , on account of the Ducheſs of York . I have not seen her yet -- I understand she is very amiable , but no Beauty . She will be a great Acquisition to the poor Princeſses , for I think it is impoſsible to stand more in Need than they did , of some young Friend . I suppose they may go into Public with her -- may they not ? -- Pray do n't let my long Silence prevent your writing to me soon . I shall be happy to hear from you . Our best Regards attend you , Mr : Dickenson , and my Brother , and I am , my dear Cousin , truly and affectely : your 's . Jane Hamilton
