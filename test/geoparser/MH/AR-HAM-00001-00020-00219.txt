71 , Queen Street 18 th . Janry- 1808 My Dear Sister , I am much concerned to hear read so bad an account of Yourself , as that , Your Letter of the 14 th - Instant furnishes me ; and likewise , of Mr. Dickenson 's accident . As he is now attending Louisa in her dancing parties , I hope , he does not feel much inconvenience from it . My House is an Hospital . Five Children in the Measles ; three of whom , are now in Bed , and two , in a state of Convalescence . My two youngest Boys introduced this disorder into the family , and my three youngest Girls have caught it . Lady Napier has been confined , for these last six weeks . A cold & Cough of an obstinate nature , which refused to submit to the usual remedies , has at length been succeeded by a violent Eruption over her Arms & Legs , which has entirely removed the Cough , and is now bestowing a new skin on her Ladyship . Though She is well in point of health , yet care must be taken , in this changeable weather , to prevent any return of her Cold , so , She has not been permitted to go out . This state of my family has occasioned my remaining at home , instead of going up to the Meeting of Parliament , which I should have done had Maria been able to stump about , as usual . Besides , the Invalid 's I have mentioned , my Boys Tutor is confined to Bed , with a feverish Complaint , which is increased by apprehension . Whenever anything is the matter with him , he grows alarmed , and there is more plague to get up his Spirits again , than to remove the disorder . I had accounts lately from my eldest Son , who is well , & cruizing in the Mediterranean . My second Son , who is cruizing in the Channel , and ought to have been drowned three weeks ago . He was conducting a Boat , with Prisoners , from a Prize to his Frigate , when ( probably being overloaded ) the Boat sunk , & left the contents sprawling in the Water . Providentially , they were near the Frigate so that they were all saved . My Francis swam to the Ship , & got up the Sides of it , changed his Cloaths , went into another Boat , & returned to the Prize for more Prisoners . As we do not aſsociate with the diſsipated & gambling part of the Community , I can give you no Intelligence as to the nature of Miſs Wynne 's return . I never met any of the Wynne 's or Campbell & his Wife , at any party I have been at . His character was notorious here , some Years ago , for having robbed Sir Charles Douglas s Pocket Book . Sir Charles accused him , and he did not resent the accusation , though , I believe , he denied it . He then left this Country , & I heard nothing more of him , till he brought down his Wife . His Marriage did not induce me to seek his acquaintance , not even , after You had told me that his Wife was your friend Lady Charlotte Campbell , as their Sister in Law countenances them , & so did Lady Augusta Clavering when here ; but , I did not find that , a sufficient reason for my family having anything to do with them . We live quietly , & our happineſs is of the domestic kind , not depending on the Gay World , with which we have very little connexion indeed . I am sorry for Mrs- Holman ; but , not at all surprised at what has happened . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Maria joins me in everything kind to You , Mr- Dickenson & Louisa . Best wishes to my Countrywoman . Ever your faithful Friend and Affectionate Brother Napier Lord Alexander Gordon was thought better , and it was supposed , might have lived ; but , this appearance of recovery did not last above two , or three days . I attended his funeral out of Edinburgh , last Monday , on its way to the North -- Edinburgh , Eighteenth January 1808 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
