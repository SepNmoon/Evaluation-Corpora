My dear Friend An opportunity this moment presents itself to send you some more proposals , but they hardly allow me time to write a word . Dont be alarmed at my sending two Dozen ; you may always return what you dont use . -- I rejoyce that you have enlisted so many brave Academical Volunteers into our service . -- What a charming day Mi≈øs Hamilton you must have had in Portman Square I know no one that has more true genuine wit than Mr. Jenyns something I think of the sly grave humour of Addison . -- You say nothing of yourself , I therefore hope you are better and that every thing goes on smoothly . -- Love to dear Mrs. Vesey -- Yours affectionately H M Hampton Mrs. G . 's best love
