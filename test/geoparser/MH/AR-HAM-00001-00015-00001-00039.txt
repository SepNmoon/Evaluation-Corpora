South Audley Street -- Sunday 7 th May My dear Friend ! by this time you are thanki n g God for Mr Dickenson s return ! he will tell you that he has seen me in good spirits , looking comfortable & occupied , I know not what he will have told you about my health , probably that I was well , but that I looked ill -- I never have a moment for writing or I would have thanked you e 're now for your dear tho ' short little note this Evening I came home from Ld Ilchester s merely to write to you & to one or two more of the many Friends , whose kind congratulations I have not yet answered -- & Mr Digby was so good as to resist coming home with me to leave me a few hours leisure , which otherwise I can never find -- I was most happy my dear Friend to hear that you were well , & Louisa improving in Health & strength & perfections , & of course that your comforts were daily increasi n g you have now too a new interest in Taxal & of course new amusement s & occupation in the alterations & improvements you are maki n g -- you do not think of London this year Mr Dickenson tells me , I do not wonder that you should dislik e quitting a beautiful spot in this delightful season where every source of happineſs is united in your husband & your Child ! one may be happy too here I find , for I am so , tho ' I feel I shall be more so , when all the dinners of ceremony are over & that we have got into a more regular plan of comfort at home -- I have hitherto enjoyed it very little in an Evening for tho ' I have been hardly in publick at all & but at one play & one Opera since I married , I have entered into so numerous a family , all so very kind to me , that it is with great difficulty I find means to divide myself amongst them without neglecting my old Friends -- I continue to be very early in the morning rise at ½ past 8 breakfast at ½ past 9 -- then Mr D . stays talking till perhaps near 12 -- then my little Girls leſsons , with sometim es a walk , sometimes some neceſsary visits & now & then Mr Parsons or Brown for myself bring me to 4 o'clock when I dreſs , & you plainly see leave me little time for writing or reading both of which talents , I feel myself in some danger of forgetting -- we have hitherto generally dined out , now I have begun to give dinners at home in return , when they are over which I trust will be in a fortnight , I shall begin to enjoy myself . I have had a return of the pain in my stomack -- & am every now & then very bad -- then better again for a day or two -- to day has been a very good day with me -- I am under Farquar 's care to please Mr D—— & my Father & am taking Hemlock , but that I take to be all nonsense , & God alone can do me good which I trust he will soon -- my Brother has been very ill from a hurt he received on his side from a fall , but he has is recoveri n g thank God very fast -- adieu my dear Friend , I must leave you for the present -- I will write again when I have more time , & hope to hear from you de temps en temps that is all one can ex pec t from a married woman & the mistre ſs of a family , at least I find it impoſsible to more -- God bleſs you -- Most sincerely yours affec : C.
