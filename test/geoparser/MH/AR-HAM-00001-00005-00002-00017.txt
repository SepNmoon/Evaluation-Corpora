From Honble Wilhelmina Murray 'On the day when he ( the king ) resumed his authority 'there was unbidden by the Govt . a general illumination 'of London ' . Stanhope in Pitt . ii . 27 . my Dear Mrs. Dickenson I delayed writing from day to day in imitation of the Parliment adjourning ; and on the same principle of hopeing to have good news : that happy time is at last come and I am sure nobody has rejoiced more sincerely , or will receive my congratulations with more pleasure than my good Friend : every Body has been or apear 'd to be , very happy ; which has made the world quite a new scene , as there are on all ocasions but this fretters , or grumblers -- last Tuesday was the day of rejoicing -- their Majesties & Princeſses dined at Windsor , on their return found their Palace lighted up , in a most Elegant manner ; the transparancy represented Doctor Willis in the Character of Esculapius leading the King to the Temple of Health ; with eight lines , the exact words were forgot but the meaning was , that the Best of Fathers , Husbands , Kings was restored to the wishes of a Loyal People -- it was a surprise the Queen compt 'd Him with & she intended to have had Kew Bridge illuminated but no lamps could be got either in town or country -- after she had seen her own illumination she came to town with the princeſses drank tea at Lord Bathurst s and then went in differrent coaches about the town to see the illuminations and did not return till two in the Morning to Kew -- it is generaly agreed there never was a more general illumination nor any ever atended from first to last , with so much good humor and so few accidents -- I went as far as the India House it was a charming sight , the city was very fine and some beautifull scenes among it , a number of mottos all expreſsive of joy and affection to the King -- we saw it without the least confuſsion or alarm as niether Bonfire nor crackers were seen but on our return home at Charing croſs we met the stop which you will be convinced was a serious one when I say it was eleven o clock when we were there and it was two in the morning when we had got to the Star & Garter in Pall-mall the whole Street so full of Carriages not one moved ; I then by my Husband s advice got into a chair & came home seeing the beautifull shew of S t . James 's St . Berkley Sqr . & Hill Street -- when I think Ld . Willoughby 's was among the preatiest I saw , as the pillars to his porch was twisted round with color 'd lamps a fringe of the same round the cornice of it . and every widow frame which altogether , made an Elegant apearance -- the histories every body furnish of their difficultys are truely laughable -- but poor Mr. Geo : Clayton s were very mortifying , Ly . Louisa has Mrs. Delayne s house in Cleveland Court he was engaged to Lord Sydney 's Ball , but sd . he would walk out first to see the illuminations and while he dreſst Lady Louisa and Mrs. Fox might make a little Tour in his Chariot and come home time enough for him to go -- the first part of the plan succeed he sat down to dreſs the Ladies went off in the Carriage and got into S t . James 's place , but there was no poſsibility of getting out of it and then they sat tired & fretting till three o clock in the Morning ; poor Mr. Clayton full dreſst could not even get a chair the croud was so immence so he sat expecting till it was too late to go . I have sent you this little item that you may form some idea of the Bustle we were all in nothing but the Coronation one I have ever seen gives any notion of the present . every Body is now in a Bustle preparing for the Drawing room which is to be consider 'd as a Birthday -- I shall exhibit a trimming of my own making which I expect to look smart with out much shew or expence every body is to be in new cloaths , and no mourning a general lighting is again to take place and a third when the King goes to S t . Pauls but as that is not wished to be it will be put off as long as poſsible as it is thought to be attended with too much fatigue for the King , and will create such a concourse and croud in the Streets for that length of way that it may be atended with mischief the Lady 's have been mortified with the not being able to exhibit their regent caps that cost from nine to forescore guineas , some few excepted who like The Irish Embaſsadors apear 'd too soon and retired in haste well laughed at -- last thursday at Almacks a Mrs. Bainsford ( a preaty Woman ) had one on the only one in the Room the Prince of Wales came in very Drunk , and began talking with a gentleman of the oposite party ( tis sd . Mr. Greville ) the cap began the subject they grew warm but all Mrs. Fitzherbert s interest was not sufficient to make the Lady remove out of sight -- the Prince swore he Gloried in his party he never would desert his friends , as long as he lived in short was so long d they Hurrah 'd him as if he had been on the stage , but at last he grew more sencible & said ; I will say no more on the subject now , as I may be sorry tomorrow , for what I have said to night -- the Duke of York every Body is shocked at -- and the general cry is , that he is a great fool ; that is the best apology a friend can make for him as nothing can excuse his behaviour -- the King has not seen the Duke of Cumberland , so I supose he will remain in disgrace as he deserves -- Miſs Louisa Lenox is going to be married to Ld . Appsley ; Ly . Tryphoena Bathurst , to a Mr. Batt a great fortune . Miſs Rodney is gone off with the Wilson that ran away with & Married Miſs Townshend some years ago -- Lord Rodney seems to have little comfort of his last wife s Children -- but that is no wonder -- every body is reading Lady Craven s Books , letters from the Crimea -- it is a very light performance like herself and is only read from her being the Author of it she is return 'd to Anspach where she has made an English Garden at an im̄ense expence , has built an English House , has her horses & c all à l'Englaise and her dear Adopted Brother pays for all , which puts the whole court in confuſsion . as his highneſs Estat was heavily burthend with debt , which he formed a plan for paying and has for years consistantly adhered to it and they were in hopes some more would have clear 'd them , but this lively Lady has seated herself on one side of him and overturns all their prudential schemes , as he is exsesively attattched to her and only sees with her Eyes -- tis time to leave her , and thank you for the kind letter & trouble you have taken about the masters but you was so long in answering and our time grew short we could not wait any longer , therefore consulting Mr. Farquharson he desired she might begin with Miſs Black without loſs of time -- so she is now very busy and if she improves as much by her masters as she does in her growth I flatter myself we shall have great credit when we return her , to her Father -- if you come to town this spring pray come Early as most likly we shall leave Town in May -- Mrs. Graham has been all this time with Lady Stormont , oweing to a long confinement Mr. Graham has had but he is now out again and as usual talking of going in a day or two to Leicestershire he is oposite of Lord Stormont s way of thinking it makes a disagreable break among such near conections I shd . think poor Lady Stormont s nervous Complaints proceed a good deal from that as I think tho ' politic 's may differ a Man shd . not unleſs his vote could be decisive forget he is a Brother , and the viscount s violence on Ld . Cathcart s Election would be very hard to digest for a Sister I should think but Basta -- I have complied with your wishes in sending you a long letter , which I expect you will soon , send me thanks for ; as London is not a place for much leisure time -- and if you are as good as I expect & wish my next may tell you how his Majesty looks as I hope to have had the pleasure of seeing him by that time I return the enclosed with many thanks it is a curious spot and I am always pleased when such are presumd as it is to be lamented so many memorable spots are plowed over and not now to be traced . I pleaded hard for the remains of some Druidical stones near Stanley ( there are many about the country ) but the ground is taken into cultivation and I fear the Gentleman is so void of taste as to think his field will not only plow better but look handsomer for being clear 'd of that peice of antiquity -- We all joyn in best wishes to Miſs & Mr. Dickenson particularly from Dear Mrs. D . Yrs . Affectionately Wilhelmina Murray
