Bath May 1 st . 1794 Thursday continued I set off with my packet for you inclosing a lettr . from Grandpapa & one from Mrs. Potter & arrived in proper time at Mrs. Boscawen s as Lord Falmouth was in ye . act of franking & a few minutes later he wou ld I suppose have been in ye . act of dreſsing for dinner . Mrs. B . shew 'd me ye Gazette containing news of ye . last Victory ; -- When I return 'd found my Beau arrived , & Harriet Rundell -- we sat down to a very pretty well dreſs 'd dinner & had you been of ye . party you would have been charm 'd with ye : engaging lively Hosteſs -- soon after dinner , wch . was at 4 oClock , I sent Louisa , her play fellow , wth . Morrison to superintend them , upstairs , that I might uninterruptedly enjoy a tête à tête with the good Man ; if I did not reap much entertainment from his conversation I had at least ye . satisfaction of perceiving he was well pleased wth- his visit & my attentions , he left me abt . 6 as he was engaged on busineſs -- from him I learnt that Richardson Author of Pamela , & c , had 4 daughters & yt a Maiden one still living abt . 20 miles from London ( a very sensible Woman & a very worthy one ) had in her poſseſsion a large collection of her father s manuscripts & letters wh . she intend ing ed leaving as a legacy to a numerous progeny of Nephews & Nieces -- Richardson left his daughters 5000 £ each . Mrs. Preston came & sat ½ an hour wt : me & inform 'd me they were to set out for Ireland on Wednesday next -- Mr. Preston is to give up 400 £ Pr . An . to his 2 d . Son who is going to marry a young Lady of good family & connexions . -- We are to pay 30 Guineas to Mrs. Dunn who 's rect . will be sufficient , & wch . we are to leave at Mr. Preston s House wth . their Cook who will remain at their ho use . Mary is to divide her time between Mrs. Talbot & Walsh during their absence . I went in the Eveg . to Lady Jane Muirhead , paſs 'd an agreeable hour & ½ with her & Lady Amelia who appears amiable & interesting -- we filled up ye . time with working & reading -- I read a few papers of ye . Lounger to ym .. I was invite d to supper by Ly J . & thinking yt . this was to continue consented -- in ye . Supper Room Mr. M : made his appearance , & soon after enterd ye . Marquis of Tullibardine & his Tutor Mr. Walker from ye . play . I shall reserve a communication of ye . conversation -- ye . Manners of Mr. M & c & c , & my remarks till we meet . Mr : W : was so galant as to croſs ye . Street wth . me to knock up at ye . door & when I made him a civil speech about calling & c & c gave a broad hint he was sensible how much he had lost by not having already been able to do so & ccccc Friday 2 d . May 1794 I went early this Morng . to Miſs S. Nicolls & made her a long visit she is certainly in an alarming state of health tho ' I do not believe she is aware of it as she does not think it neceſsary to have medical aſsistance . She was writing to Mrs. Price & I helpd her to fill up her letter by meſsages to Mr. Wright informing him of your Hunting Royal Stags as well as humble dwellings & c & c -- In my way home sat ½ an hour with Mrs. Pigotts -- they are in poſseſsion of the finest Portrait of Sr. J Reynolds I ever saw of their Mother -- you must not quit Bath without seeing it . they told me that he was so well satisfied with ye . credit this picture would do him in after ages that he said he ought to pay them instead of receiving their money . When I came home found your shabby little letter from Chorleywood -- there was to be sure somewhat affectionate in ye . two or three first lines wch . in some measure reconcil 'd me to ye . disappointment of a more circumstantial letter from thence -- poor Morrison look 'd very blank , but consoled herself with hopes that tomorrows post would , agre eable to your promise , make full amends , Mr : Muirhead , the Marquis , & Mr. Walker had call 'd during my absence . -- You have had a fine day for excursions but the Gardeners are praying for rain . Miſs Irelands came to see me & I was glad to be at home the Eldest is a well bred , very modest , & sensible Young Woman , her father is a Wine Merchant , & lives near Bristol -- I have promised to visit her when we go there , therefore shall not repeat to you , what she repeated from her father during his being at Paris last year , his paſsing thro ' ye : allied armies & other equally interesting subjects . Martin came here to day for ye . first time this week Louisa however danc 'd tolerably well , -- I believe I have told you that ye . A Abbé Rudemare gave her ye . whole hour since you went -- I now regret she had not ye . same advantage since his first attendance . Mr. Stratton has had ye . Gout but is again able to mount the Hill . Miſs Green has been with her three times since you left us . In the afternoon Louisa had no mercy on the Shrubs in ye . Garden being determined Master Granville Leveson Gower should have a fine May Nosegay -- She had been so amiable that when I had bleſsed her for ye . night I gratified her & went to Mrs. Boscowan accompanied by Squire Charles bearer of ye . fragrant present wch . was rather too large for me to carry . -- I had an hours very pleasant Chat with Mrs. B . as Lord F : Mrs : J : & Mr & amp ; Mrs. Evelyn were playing at cards -- Mrs. Bos : is not pleased with our paying ye . K of Pruſsia so liberally & seems averse to our being engaged in ye : War ; Was shewn Ld . F : Regimentals -- wch . are in a good taste . I calld at ye . Rundells before I return 'd home they have wth- ym . a Mrs. Trevanion -- / who 's husband was kill 'd in ye . Ruſsian Service/ & her child -- she is soon to return to Ruſsia -- the Empreſs allows her a pension of 150 £ Pr . An : Saturday 3 d . May -- After Rudemare went -- I must tell you Louisa improves both in her french & english , I endeavour to make her as attentive as I can 't is in want of attention she fails . I sent Morrison & Louisa to enquire after Miſs S Nicolls -- She was better -- It was so broiling hot that I would not go out besides ye . Town was full of Bustle on acct . of ye . Election -- Charles saw Sr. Pepper seated in his triumphal Car . I told you the Cook was to go & aſsist Smith she went to ye . Town Hall early on ye . Morng . & I expected to sit down to a Cold dinner -- but Charles was resolved to shew what he could do , & to our Surprise we had roast veal , -- a made dish of mutton , -- hot Vegetables , Butter Well Melted , of his Cooking , & by way of letting us see he knew how to set off a Table , every thing cold in ye : Larder was produced & we had five & fives . It was lucky I was no longer bilious for it would doubtleſs have been mortifying to a high degree had I not done honor to his dinner . Morrison said I work 'd & eat out of vexation to day having been terribly disappo inted in not receiving a letter from you wch : you promised in your last faithfully , ( as I imagin 'd , ) I should . I have a great Mind to punish you & not send this large proof of my affection . Martin gave Louisa a good leſson to day and I encounterd half an hour of his fragrances to see her dance her minute minuet . I drank tea with Louisa & then went to Mr .. Bigge s -- Mrs : & Miſs Rundell & c were there -- spent two pleasant hours -- Mr : Bigge & his Wife kept up ye . Ball of conversation very agreeably . Mrs. R . preſs 'd me much to go home & sup with them telling me yt . Mr. R . had set his heart upon it -- but prefer r ing eating a few Radishes quietly wth- Meg . I debat declined & came home abt . 10 . Sunday -- I shall not I think venture to send you any more letters -- this I will get directed to Ly . Wake s in London . if I had been rich enough I would have surprised you -- Pray send for Money & let me have some , for so poor am I at this present writing that I must borrow money to pay for ye . postage of your next letter whenever it arrives . Well I have borrowd ye . Money & paid postage for the letter ; Tho ' I do not fuſs myself about you as I used to have reason to do , I should be better satisfied if you would mention whether you are well or ill -- with whole limbs or broken bones , pleased or displeas 'd , in a paſsion or out of a paſsion , & so forth . You say true few are the families where reign domestic harmony & peace equal to our own -- but I must hasten to close this letter & not indulge myself by a full reply to yours -- I shall get a frank from Lord Falmouth & enclose a letter from Stockport -- If I have time I will avail write under ye . cover to Lady Wake -- if I should not , I depend on Your saying every thing expreſsive of ye . true affection I bear her . Comet is well & so full of pranks that he has done a guineas worth of mischief to some apple trees , & tho ' he has almost eaten up ye . pasture of the Orchard , -- his palate is grown too nice to relish his once favorite treat of bread , wch . I find he disdainfully refusd even from the affectionate hands of Charles this Morning ; -- Charles has so gain 'd upon ye . attach hearts of Dash & Sancho that they are his inseparable companions -- the former carries his stick & ye . later has been taught to be delighted to have ye . honor of carrying Louisa s Doll fastened on his back . Louisa desires me to tell you she is taking pains with in every thing she learns , that she loves you dearly & that she is quite well -- The Nightingales in ye . Grove behind ye . House sing D ay & Night most harmoniously . Let me know if you have recd . my letters according to their dates
