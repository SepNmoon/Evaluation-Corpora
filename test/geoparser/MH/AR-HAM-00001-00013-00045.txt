Friday April 27 th 1787 My dearest friend This morning our dearest Miſs Glover breakfasted wth- us , she has not recover 'd her good looks , but says she is better than when we went to Bath , I am to write a journal , I think that is what you desir 'd , I am willing if it can afford you the smallest amusement , to obey , Yesterday , A Maria & the Bean drank tea here , nothing particular paſs 'd , but he was attentive & was very lively , we play 'd a rubber at 6 d : whist we cut in & were partners , & both made as many blunders as poſsible , not designedly on my part I can aſsure you , we were very merry , & that does not suit the sober game at whist , they supp 'd & left us at half past Eleven . We have my dear friend just receiv 'd your melancholy letter , & feel most sincerely for my Brother & yourself , we pray wth . you may the Almighty either relieve or release him ; poor good man , I hope your dearest Mrs. B . will take as much care of himself as his present affliction will permit him , pray give our kindest & most affectionate love to him , -- I am happy our dear little Dickenson bore her journey so well , may The Almighty pour down his bleſsings on her head & make her worthy of the parents he has given her , I foretell that child will poſseſs a m n amiable disposition , I think of you all constantly , & often say , when & where shall I see them again , I have reason to think my self happy in my present prospect yet I will not build my hopes & expectations too high , tho ' the more I see of a certain person the more I like him . Saturday morn 28 th : Yesterday we din 'd at Louisa after dinner we had some conversation , not very interesting , but sufficiently so , to convince us all that he is the amiable charecter we thought him , we were again desir 'd to make up a rubber at whist , as there were five I beg 'd to be excused , but my beau took my hand & beg 'd me to play , & as he was to be my partner I did not refuse , we sat down & lost the great sum of three & sixpence , we supp 'd & after supper talk 'd about India , & Mr. B : said that of all the countries he had been in their were no women to be compar 'd to the english bowing to those that were present , it is still a custom in some parts of India for the women to burn themselves with their deceas 'd husbands , Monsieur —— was at one of these funeral s ceremonies the woman was very handsome & had several children , he talk 'd to her & tried to prevail on her not to do it , & promis 'd to provide for her & her children , she refus 'd & told him that she should again be reunited to her husband , & she well knew that her children would be provided for , she accordingly after taking leave of her children & friends threw herself on the pile waved her hand as a signal , it was then set on fire , the shouting that the priests & attendants make , prevent you from hearing the poor victim ; As soon as this ceremony is over , the children of the woman are rais 'd to be the first people in the Country , in honor of the mother . -- I must now let you into a secret , but do not mention it , my friend has two natural children , a boy & a girl , they were born in India therefore of a different complexion from ours , he brought them over with him , to have them well educated , the girl is to return when she is of a proper age , but from what I hear the boy is to remain in England , the one is seven years old the other eight ; he has not mention 'd them to my Mother yet , I shall be very glad when he has , he may depend on my paying proper attention to them , Adieu for to day . -- Sunday morn : Yesterday morning we had a pleasant trio to breakfast , I order 'd the carriage at eleven to go out meaning to leave my Mother & the gentleman together , he beg 'd to accompany me , I gave no answer as I did not think it proper to go out alone wth . him in the coach after so short an interview , my Mother perceiving me distreſs 'd , said as you wish to attend Mr H—— I must go likewise as it is not the right thing for her to go out alone with a gentleman , so accordingly we all went together , my Mother had some busineſs to transact at Mary a friend s in the Strand , we continued in the coach , he had hold of my hand & we were talking upon various things , when my Mother came back again , she told me in a whisper that our friend said he should roast me well when he saw me for courting in the Strand . Apropos I forgot to mention that he has told my Mother of the two children , they both behav 'd very handsomly , she said she was certain that I should allways pay them every proper attention , & if they behav 'd well that I should love them , he said he should certainly have not had any thoughts of marrying me if he had not had that opinion of me , the boy he doats on , he is a very sensible fine child , the girl is not so handsome nor so cle a ver but a good little girl ; he did not expect he said that I should like his children so well as my own , & that it certainly would make a great difference if we were to have children , he is a very affectionate father to these two , my Mother has promis 'd that we are to go & see the girl she is at a school at Clapton . -- M o nday morn . We went to church yesterday & I hope profited by a most excellent Sermon preach 'd by Mr , the text was “ speak ill of no man ” Titus , 3:2 -- after church we call 'd on Dr. Goſsin & Mrs. Vernon , they sincerely congratulated me on futture prospects , indeed all my friends seem much pleas 'd & even interested in my happineſs . On Saturday morning Mrs. Reveley carried a note for my Mother to our amiable Isaac , his servant receiv 'd the note & hearing it came from us , said so my master is going to marry yr young Lady , I can aſsure you he is a very good man , well said Henry & our young Lady is a sweet temper 'd woman & will make a very good miſstreſs , then replied the other the sooner my master brings her home the better , so you see my dr . how soon they settled it . We had a very agreeable day yesterday Isaac & Mr & himself form 'd our dinner party , in the afternoon came his two friends Mrs. B . & Mr she took the kindest & most affectionate notice of me , & was pleas 'd to see her dr . Mrs. H—— as she always calls him so properly attentive , they left us at nine the rest of our party staid till half past eleven . Tuesday 1 st .. May . At breakfast yesterday I perceiv 'd my dr . Henry ( for so I shall always call him ) appear 'd very much as if he wish 'd to have some private conversation with me , my Mother left the room & he then seated himself ( I tell you every thing ) & very respectfully took my hand began by saying that I well knew his sentiments in regard to me & that if I wd . do him the honor to accept of a hand & heart wholly my own he had his to offer , but at the same he should hope to have an equal return ; at the first I felt quite lost & for a minute or two cd . not give him an answer , but at last he receiv 'd one that satisfied him , for he immediately saluted me , he mention 'd his children & said he did not nor cd . not expect me to love them as my own all he should entreat that no one wd . ever try to alienate his affections from them , & I aſsur 'd him , that for his sake I wd pay them all the attention I cd . & that if they behav 'd well , I sd most certainly love them . -- after we had settled everything to our own satisfaction , I heard my Mother in the next room , I beg 'd her to walk in , she gueſs 'd that all things were fix 'd by the confuſsion in my looks , they enter 'd into conversation & my Mother told him he must bespeak a new coach , on this occasion , he has already a very handsome Chariot & a phaeton , which I should have thought enough for myself , but however his friends think it right , so the coach is bespoke , he desir 'd me not to mind the money but to have it perfectly elegant & handsome ; we were together all the afternoon yesterday , he wishes our marriage not to be delay 'd any longer than is absolutely neceſsary , as he shall date his future happineſs from the day of our being united , so that I fancy as soon as the coach is ready , I shall lose my present name , it is an awful change -- for better -- for worse -- & for life -- I only pray that I may be deserving of the many many bleſsings I have hitherto receiv 'd , & of the husband I shall ere long have , you & my dr . Brother will I am sure love him , his charecter my dest- friend is beyond his fortune , every one speaks well of him , every one loves him , & this is the man my that yr . happy thrice happy Henry is going to be united too . My dr . Mary has seen him & what little she saw of him she likes him , they are she is to be here this evening & A : Maria & Mr . . He desir 'd me yesterday to invite my Mother to be as much at Henley Park as she likes . I am afraid to ask how yr . truly valuable father goes on , nor wd . I have intruded this long scribble on yr . time , had I not known from the great love you have for me , that you wd : be anxious to know how matters went on . This week we shall go for two or three days to Henly Park , you must forgive me if I do not continue my journal , as my time is wholly taken up . pray salute the lovely innocent for me , & believe me ever my dearest friend your ever oblig 'd & affectionate Mrs. Vernon
