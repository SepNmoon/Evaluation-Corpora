My dear Sir I have just now receiv 'd the favor of yours of the 22 d . Inst . & highly approve your judicious management in all respects in a very troublesome busineſs . I wish to do credit to my dear daughter 's memory , by which I understand that all her debts may be faithfully discharged , as she explained herself most explicitly to good Mrs. Mann M rs . Mann & to Doctor Whalley . I refer you to the former & will agree to everything she may desire you to do on my account . Mrs. Holman 's dying requests transmitted to me through Dr. Whalley , Mrs. Mann was not privy to , tho ' I perceive they were made in consequence of arrangements made with my daughter , all these I hold most sacred & shall be strictly complied with ; they were dictated in perfect equity , since they referrd to money absolutely her own , & of which I I had made her a free gift . I regret that I dared not encourage Mrs. Mann 's visit to me as I am desirous beyond measure to have a meeting with her , I have invariably approved of her conduct , mark 'd with generosity & unwearied affection to my late dear daughter , who conceal 'd nothing from her . When I opened my busineſs with Mr. Holman who has been with me two days , I premised , that there was one point neceſsary without which I cou 'd not proceed , the acknowledgement of his having receiv 'd £4000 in part of the portion I proposed to give my daughter , having aſsented to this , I have paid him £2111 . 11 15 in balance of £6000 her portion which depended solely upon my verbal agreement with him , as I wou 'd never sign any contract . I have got his general discharge in full of all demands whatever . As Mr. H had reason to expect a different conduct , I believe he was agreeably surprised , but still he had the aſsurance to appeal to my aſsurance generosity in a most absurd harangue ; that his marriage had been the cause of his present deplorable situation , urging me to entitle him to receive £2000 settled on my daughter & which he had receivd You may believe I gave this impudent proposal an absolute negative . On his taking leave , he desird permiſsion to write to me , to which I gave him this short answer , Sir you have now an opportunity of communicating the object of your letter in person , which is a mode preferable to writing , propose your busineſ , he then beat over the old ground by an appeal to my generosity , & that as I retain 'd the Annuity I might let him partake of it ; this put an abrupt conclusion to our conference & I am happy in the thought all connexion between us is now totally at an end ; for shou 'd he attempt to force a correspondence he will receive no answer to his letters , which I am certain wou 'd be replete with impertinence & fallacy With my best compts . to Mrs . & Miſs Dickenson I remain My dear Sir Your faithful & obliged humble Servt .
