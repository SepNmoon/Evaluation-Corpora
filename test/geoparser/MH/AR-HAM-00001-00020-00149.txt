Wilton Lodge 13 th - June 1799 . My Dear Sister , As your post Office people at Leighton Buzzard can not read , your Letter went to Harwich , instead of Hawick , by which means , I have been for four days deprived of the superlative satisfaction of knowing that You are still in existence . This peice of information I received with the utmost Graciousness , and as I learned , at the same time , that your Husband , Kitten , & my Countrywoman are amongst the Living , I sincerely congratulate You all , particularly Mr. D . that he has got You , again fixed , in the Country . When Wives gad about Town , they are apt to become unmanageable , for which good reason , I have taken special care to keep my Rib in the Country . Though to convince You that I have great confidence in her Discretion , I have permitted her to make a Trip , acroſs the Mountains , to Newcastle , without my attending her , and Monday is fixed for her departure . In return for this , She brings back with her my Son William , who is to honour Us with his Company , during his holidays . When these are ended , it is proposed that I should take the young Gentleman , back again . Maria has not been at all well , this Winter , and was by no means so , when I came home . She still has a Cold , which the uncertain weather will not let her get quit of . I trust , this little Jaunt may do her good , both as Exercise , and as change of Air . How I shall contrive to keep all the Seven Children in order , at home , during her Absence , rather puzzles Me . Every thing , in this Country , is at least a Month later than usual . It is , a melancholy sort of Comfort , but still it is a Comfort , to know that our Neighbours in England , are not better off than ourselves . I do not expect that any of my Hay will be ready for cutting before the end of next Month , and if my Wheat , Barley , an Oats are fairly in the Barn Yard by November , my expectations will be answered . As to our Beef and Mutton , the poor Animals are half starved . The Store Farmers , on the Sheep Farms , have lost almost all their Lambs from the severity of the Weather ; and what is even of more consequence to them , there has been a great Mortality amongst the old Sheep . All this is very serious to those , who like myself , draw our Rents from Sheep Farms . When Rent Day arrives , I expect to be treated with a black List of Loſses , instead of Bank Notes . The Japan Warehouse cost me some trouble to comprehend . As to the Lord & Lady Cathcart , She would be in great Grief for the death of her Mother , to whom she was very much attached . I received the Accounts of the old Woman s death , which was sudden , on my Road North . To us , the loſs is considerable , as Mrs= Elliot spent most of her time with my Neighbour , Admiral Elliot , whose house has always been a kind of second home to us , and Maria used to be frequently there , while I was with my Regiment . Mrs- Elliot has left her property to be divided equally between her Daughters Lady Cathcart & Lady Carnegie . What the amount of it may be , I know not , but I fancy it must be something handsome . My Aunt Lady Christian Graham , has at the Age of Eighty four , or six , removed from this World to a better . Her Son Tommy is with his Regiment at Minorca . You need not tell me about Your Roads . There is not a Bone in my Body , that is not perfectly convinced of their Execrability . I have more than half vowed , never to do penance on them again . Therefore , if You wish that We should live in the same Neighbourhood , You must remove Your Establishment to this part of the World , where we could meet without being in danger of breaking our Necks . Mr. D . would be an admirable acquisition to my Lady at the Harpsichord , and might groan forth an Accompaniment on the Violoncello , while You & I were disputing in a sharper Key . I never heard of Lord Monboddo 's proposal of Marriage to Mrs- Garrick . But , it was high time for him to die , as he was quite superannuated . Lord Selkirk left one Son , the present Earl , and , I believe , four or five Daughters . The second Daughter married Sir James Hall , as notorious a Republican as her Father . Four Sons of Lord Selkirk died , after they grew up to be Men . The present Lord was the youngest Boy . If his political principles are no better than those of the rest of his Family , I shall not weep on being desired to put on a black Coat for him . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Love & best wishes to You & Yours . Ever Yours Sincerely Napier Remember Me to my Countrywoman Hawick , Thirteenth June 1799 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds . Napier .
