Stan . St : Sepr : 13 2 o'Clock Yr : kind Letter my Dr : Mrs : Dickinson I feel grateful for as I ought to do , & the Offer your good & worthy Husd : makes of coming up to my Dr : Dr : Son -- but alas He is not in a State to receive comfort or Amusement from Company -- even Mr : Allen whom he likes so much & who travelled with us , He has not wished to see above once this Week , & that he did quite out of Civility -- His greatest Pleasure is to have me , either alone , or with his poor Father , & for us to read together ; or chat as he calls it quietly together -- He often talks of you & Mr. D . & has planned ( poor Sweet Soul ) to co go o me & make you another visit . At this Instant he is fast asleep -- & his Cough has been rather leſs frequent this Morng : he bore his Journey to this Place wonderfully , & feels happy in being at home again : I am indeed infinitely thankful that we are here again . Docr : Turton attends him as Warren is in Wales -- & his Medicines certainly agree with Him : as soon If I have any comfort to send you , I 'll write directly . God Almighty knows but what is best for us -- his Bleſsed Will be done Yrs : ever Afft & gratefully PC My poor Dr : Husband is but indifferent -- but it is to me amazing that either He or I are as well as we are -- God Almighty is very merciful in supporting us to go thro ' this great Affliction as He does -- I hope yr . dr Child is well -- God Bleſs her , & her Dr : Parents . Ly Cremorne Sepr . 13 th . 1787 I hear Dr : Ly : W . is better but She has not yet lost her Cough . I hope I have directed this Letter right .
