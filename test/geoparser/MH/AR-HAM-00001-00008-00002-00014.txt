Billingbear Ocbr . 18 th - 1792 I was much Mortified my dear Sir & Madam -- at the long Silence & apparent Coldneſs of my Friends but was Still more Concern 'd when I found on the rect of Blosset s kind letter that the silence was so Accounted for , I am indeed truly Griev 'd to hear that Mr Dickenson has been so Unlucky as to lose a little Brother or Sister to the dear little Mrs Dickenson & most truly hope that she will take great care of herself in case she sd be bleeding as I believe ( at least I 've been told ) that these Accidents are very hurtful to the general Constitution -- I flatter my self there will be no future Chasms in our Correspondence . I can easily believe how many little immemorable Events take place which prevent one from writing a letter . & are too insignificant to be Inescere imprimis as to yr Enquiry respecting Louisa s honours you were perfectly right in your Conjectures . Mon sr . le Medicin , will not do abroad . except at Paris , where perhaps that Title wd be now too aſsuming . I find the Party paſs 'd thr ' o France without interruption their original design was to remain at Geneva till this Month . if they have not yet Croſs 'd the Alps . I think their Chance at present , but a bad one -- take the Season -- the Uncommon Events which have occur 'd in the Space of as few Months the appearance is awful -- I find some of the Learned & more Serious part of Mankind , are apprehensive that all these are preludes to the great Event that we are taught to look forward to this is much beyond the boundaries of my reason th ' o I may have ventur 'd to think on these things , in a lonely hour -- most horrible have been the Effects of this Wonderful revolution in France -- however I am only surpris 'd that as the World in general is certainly more Civilis 'd , that these People sd be so Ferocious now as they were 280 years ago . I have been reading the History of the reformation , & the reform 'd Churches in France -- & I have been frequently surpris 'd to see the same accounts in the Stir of last Week that I read an hour before in that book -- it is a very pleasant Book wrote with Vivacity & impartiality -- by Dr Blagden . I have paſs 'd Nine Weeks at Trunkwell with my the Revd Stephen Laval it is a sweet place & I sd rather imagine not Unlike Taxall . It has not been alter 'd according to the fashion of the times . there I live very much Secluded . My Aunt has part of her Estate in her hands & I have as much interest in the Events of the Farm as any one can have in Affairs of State -- we have been lucky in our Harvest . & all but the latter meadow Hay has been Succeſsful . we arriv 'd here the day before Yesterday & find Aunt St Leger much as he was last year -- he says leſs for he certainly grows Weaker -- Mr. Neville desires me to present her best Compliments to Miſs Neville a report prevail 'd a few days ago . that Mrs. Dickenson is to marry Mr. G : Cambridge , but Yesterday there came another account to say that it was not so sure as it was Announc 'd to be -- I hear her Mother the Eldest Miſs Thrale is gone to Paris I suppose to learn how to regulate a State -- so perhaps to see the trial of the Ci devant R de F : not that I expect they will come to that Extremity . I rather think they will keep them prisoners for Life -- the Gracious R : has committed an indescretion which occasion 'd his being very ill for Several hours he Eat Apple Pye & Tea -- his R——l Consort has something the matter with her R——l foot . now reste . I believe the Court is now Much as it was in Mrs Piozzi s Time -- you did not name Mrs. D—— I hope she has not had any return of her Stomach Complaint . I beg to be kindly remember 'd to her . & to little dear Miſs Dickenson . I hope she attends Louisa upon Myra & I beg she will send me an account of her Turkeys -- poor Grandpapa has been very ill with a Complaint in her Stomach . I hope she is now much better for the Angostura Bark -- Pray let me know if Mrs. de Salis goes abroad . I sd hardly think she wd venture . & yet she seem 'd to have so much inclination that perhaps she may go to Naples by Sea . Lady Herries & Lord are going inmediately -- Lady Camelford was to meet Sir Robt : but I sd suppose it wd not be an easy matter to appoint the places where to meet . Adieu my dear Lady Herries & Mr my Mother is I thank God very well & joi Un ites with me in in best Compts . & wishes -- & believe me yr very faithful & oblig 'd Mrs Dickenson NB : direct under Cover to DBloſset Billingbear Maidenhead I shall now see by the Time you take if you are to be depended upon --
