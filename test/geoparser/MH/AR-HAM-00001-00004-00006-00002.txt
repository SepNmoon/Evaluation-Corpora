St. Georges Bermuda Decr 6 th . 1790 I rejoyce in your account of Mr. Ds . improvement in health -- pray acquaint him of of that & the & era - When I reflect upon my situation , so distant from many whom I revere , esteem , or love , the first impulse is that of regret , but I correct this as well as poſſible , by recollecting that I am not entirely forgotten by these estimable friends , that in general distance produces indifference first , and secondly , some thing very like oblivion -- now since I derive so much pleasure from the communication of friends , how am I to expreſs my thankfullneſs ? In the only way in my situation poſſible , that is by setting out on my journey towards them ( by letter ) in such a minnikin character as shews my wish to have a long talk with them in expectation of a reply twice as long -- and indeed all things duely considerd I have a right to that expectation -- My European friends are furnished with a thousand topics of information , and anecdote which must be interesting to one so remote from what is called The World , as I am -- You my dear Cousin for I will be so unfashionable , but at the same time so vain as to use the antiquated term which implies something nearer than common acquaintance or even friendship , You my dear Coz ( note the familiarity ) have well understood how great the pleasure must be which I derive from so chearful and pleasant a letter as you have honord me with . However proud you may be ( as a Hamilton ) I have that persuasion of your excellent understanding that titles Wealth and all exterior loses with you when set in contrast with honor , honest pride , veracity generosity humanity and those leſs brilliant but more amiable qualifications of which some of our un ... common acquaintances and friends are poſſeſsd -- I thank you a thousand times for your flattery in writing to me ( and that your letter was not a short one ) -- This kindneſs was the leſs expected , as , when I was last in England ( however my health might be ) my Spirits were by no means up to their usual level -- Under such circumstances it was but natural that I should appear indifferent where indifference could not or ought not to find admittance . I well recollect a coldneſs of manner and an indifference to the subjects of conversation which might well wear the appearance of apathy or superciliousneſs , neither of which were however at bottom -- When I went to Bath at the sollicitation of M . I carryed with me from London real affection and a wish to promote the happineſs of loving and estimable people , but I was aware that the incertainty of my situation joined to the embarrassment of my circumstances laid so many pounds weight of lead upon a heart naturally light and inconsiderate , and that a grave look and frequent absenses gave me an air of indifference which were totally foreign to my natural diſposition , and that habitual careleſsneſs which my old friends and acquaintances know to be part of the embroidery of my constitution . I pray you gentle Cox pardon that apparent coldneſs and visiting manner , for which I frequently snubbed myself , while your courteousneſs and prevenance invited me to more frequent and leſs constrained intercourse -- I owe to your kindneſs this confeſſion and now having bent the knee , I will teize you no longer with peccavis Of Lady D. Vesie an able panegyrist would be posed to pronounce all her various merits , I must content myself with telling you what I think of her . That the man who is in poſſeſsion of such a Treasure ought to endeavor by every poſſible attention to let her understand , what a value he set upon so inestimable a prize in the matrimonial lottery -- She can not hide her Talents in a napkin , but her diffidence constantly throws a veil over them . with a masculine mind and understanding , she is truly femine and most delicately so without parade or affectation -- She knows too well what beauty is , to be blind to her own , but not a gesture escapes her that can betray her consciousneſs of it . I will believe that the happyneſs of her friends is more likely to fill her eyes with tears than any distreſs of her own -- you may discover a beautiful soul thro a pair of such eyes ! I own I never dared to consider the lustre of them for fear of offending -- If Women were to be placed on seats according to the rate of their perfections she should undoubtedly hold her place among the highest -- This Thought reminds me of the Painters scale , and on that Model I would frame one for a set of Females whom I am so happy as to have known in my life and who have honord me with some tokens of their condescension or what other term shall I use , goodwill , will that do ? you are of the number so judge -- I detest those men who are looking out for specks on snow , I could use the Seamans phrase , & bl-st their eyes -- so much in the way of answer to Mr. D—— s Quære -- now I will turn to a subject that is very familiar to me , that dear delightful creature myself -- I am so happy that I think I shall go out of the World as Horace says uti conviva satir Horace , Satires 1 : i , 94 . I know you know well enough -- yet you will turn to Mr. D——n , pray what does this man mean , is this his politeneſs , does he take me for a she Pedant ? I can aſſure you my amiable Coz , that the flattering circumstance of receiving letters from kind absentees makes the chief gratification and solamen of my present situation , but I will tell you circumstantially how my time paſses and you shall tell me in your next not to indulge too far the loquacity of my pen -- I can not write long small letters to a person I do not affectionate -- I will employ the term that comes to hand , tho ' I should paſs for a puppy , what care I ? However before I come to that part of my scribble , I will congratulate you both on that delightfull independance you so exultingly describe may you long enjoy it in perfection , and take my sacred word for it , I will be eyewitneſs of your happyneſs if Lady Fortune ever indulges my wish to see England again where so many of my dear dear friends are to be found -- The kind terms of your letter engage me to the most unreserved communication has Mrs : Stratford s sister , alias her Mother s daughter profited by the private Theatricals which were so public -- is her father yet disgusted with his new house or his old ... lady -- This is so venemously cruel that if I could be afraid of you I would not suffer such a sentence to appear against me , but it is a proof that I can entrust you with the black part of my own character -- I once at Oxford met a little starched Cousin , late a fellow of C . C . now Dean of Tuam in Ireland , after dinner pour m'egayer I ridiculed some of my old card playing everlasting Aunts , and the University man with a very grave face & monitory tone of Voice cried oh Couzen ! we should never laugh at our Relations , whereof I think our relations are as fair game as heart can wish , my friend is my relation and I bleſs my stars there are a number in the world whom I love pretty intensely -- indeed I have some relations who are the best of friends , tried ones , refined in that unerring crucible , the test of all profeſſions and promises , I mean the parting with their money -- I require of you to tell me what alterations you have made in house garden or farm , if the elder Mr. D . has been with you since your setting up for yourselves -- have your Neighbours a de V . among them ? rejoyce with me on the marriage of Mrs : Villiers , I am glad at heart for it , there is sterling merit on the side of the Woman , all I desire of the Man is that he should be a match for her -- You must know my clever Cousin that I am an Irish Patriot , that is , I am delighted to hear of improvement in commerce , science , manners , that wild is becoming tame , that vanity is becoming pride , ostentation hospitallity , and hospitallity improved from making folk deadly drunk , into making them sociably reasonably happy -- But England is my Foster Country , to it I owe so much that if during my remainder of life rebellion took place in Shamrockshire , I should coot paddy 's troat to larn him better manners -- Lord de V . making love puts me in mind of the Boar in silence creeping Alexander Pope , A Love Song : In the Modern Taste ( 1733 ) . -- He is very ill of the Gout , but he will certainly recover -- young M : writes me long letters , how I should love the man whom I could approve for her help mate , what do you think of her ? if I was a young Catholic , I would kiſs the Pope 's for a dispensation , so well I think of her -- In a conversation where the personae dramatis were Lydia Whyte Colol . Phipps Mary Preston Junior and your humble , it seemed to me that Spinster Mary had more solidity with connaiſsance de cause than we other three -- it is withal a loving Soul , and far from selfish , that is the sort of thing which ought to have a husband and children , and some of those personals which give a zest to existence , and make us more devout than Hell and the Devil , pitch for his pasture Worms despair & darkneſs & c & c A beautiful Woman , a rose or any sweet , the Ocean , sky , the Moon , a Cathedral , an Organ and Psalm , Mrs : Jordan in Viola , Mrs : Milnes tho in full dreſs , an Orchard in full bearing , forgiveness with tears , the glorious Sun , these are sparks from the Powerful king whose light we dare not look up to . These are emanations which our senses qualify us to admire , & thro ' which we communicate adoration without a direct addreſs -- What think you -- Our Parson here , is a stupid fellow , prays for rain -- I might just as well pray for L. de V . or Mrs : P . or any other of my adorables who are actually in poſſeſſion of the rightful owners -- This is fine language from a Greybeard . but as the Clock chinks , or some such saw built on experiance -- you postage for all this -- I wish I could transfer you some of my roses and July flowers and sweetpeas all a blowse of sweets , not such northerly puling things , fosterd like spoiled children as you Derbyshire folk will just have a peep at about July , and part with in September -- We Mudians are in a confusion of Flowers and Verdure all the year thro ' , almost and if I may judge of myself , tho ' I am losing my hair & have the gout & am more wrinkled than the most scientific side of the Witch of Endor , I am as bold as Kicksy and putting off the appearance of dread as much as I can , swagger from time to time and cry out like him who 's afraid .
