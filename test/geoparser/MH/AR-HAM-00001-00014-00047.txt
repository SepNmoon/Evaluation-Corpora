16 th Sepr 1780 I have my Dear so frequently experienced the Sincerity of your Conduct towards me , that the Contents of your very friendly Letter /which I red . only yesterday , as the Person to whom it was inclosed had been absent for a couple of days/ did not at all surprise me ; You judged perfectly right in regard to my intentions , for I am most fully determined & will persist , you know how much I have suffered from that Quarter , nothing shall ever make me rue the wish of doing it again , & so I have told her Mother , & her Father likewise . From the beginning of my Employment in this Family , I never had but one desire , which was that of fulfilling my Duty thoroughly & Sincerely , I have frequently told you that from the Moment I found myself useleſs I would desist , in that Quarter I have proved it very sufficiently , & could her Heart be examined I believe one should easily perceive , that she is pleased to have got rid of me , tho ' there has hitherto been some mor tify ing Circumstances attending it , but I believe the former outweighs the latter , How it will be settled I know not ; I was quite sure that our Friend would be very much distreſsed & provoked at me & had she Years ago listened to the various compl aints that were made things , perhaps , might not have come to the heigth they now are , but that is past & can not be recalled , You are convinced I am Sure that I have ever wished to make your Life as comfortable , as the nature of the Place would allow it , & believe me I shall ever do it , I know you too well to doubt your Sincerity or to think you would ever act countre me in any respect , & I hope that my determination will not be produ ctive of any additional trouble or anxiety to you . P R has declared her affection for you , & wishes exceedingly for your early return . & I know her well enough to be sure that she will do every thing in her power to gain both of you -- A thousand thanks for yr kind anxiety about my Health , it is really better than I could expect , I c an not say as much for my Spirits , for they are by no means what they were , & had I not taken the firm Resolution I have done , I am sure they would have been quit e Su n k.God Bleſs you my dear Friend believe that I shall Ever most sincerely wish to promote your Happineſs , & that I shall recollect your Friendship & openeſs to me with Gratitude Adieu -- Sepbr . 16 th . 1780 Miſs Goldsworthy Princeſs Royal Eastbourne Suſsex
