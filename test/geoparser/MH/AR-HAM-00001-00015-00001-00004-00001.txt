My dearest Friend , How do you do ? I was miserable about you the other night , and could not send yesterday , as my Servant was obliged to go to Cheapside -- Mrs Wal : tho ' told me you were better -- pray my dear do not engage yourself for next Sunday , that we may dine together -- I am expecting Bell -- Adieu à Lundi if I can not call on you I will send you word , but have no doubt of it -- God bleſs you . CMG -- Friday
