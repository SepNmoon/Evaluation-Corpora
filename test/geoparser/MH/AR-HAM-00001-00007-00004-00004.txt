10 th . May 1781 It appears to me most clearly that Miſs never understood yr conversation with her in the Light you wishd her to understand it . Your delicacy prevented your speaking plainly to her , and she misinterpreted your Embarraſsment . Hence arose the second Paragraph in her Letter . She imagines you doubted the Truth of her Aſsertions , but her uneasineſs now is leſsened by her having a Letter from her Mr “ which certifies , tho indirectly “ his situation & speaks for the ” “ Truth of what she then advanced ” . Her reason therefore for wishing a second Interview is merely to shew you that she was fully authorizd in the first instance . She certainly does not think yr objection is to the Suit , but to the manner of offering it : & therefore in the latter pt of her Letter she says , if this method of application , viz , thro her , has met with your disapprobation , Mr will be induced to take some other which may be more succeſsful . You may say perha ps that I am a Commentator where no Comment is neceſsary : if we think alike my vanity will be flatterd if differently I know I run no Risque in venturing an Opinion to you . I find myself totally unable to do as much with respect to your future Conduct ; nor is it at all nec eſsary : In cases of delicacy , a de licate mind will never act improperly . Permit me however to say that I can see no impropriety in your answering the enclosed , indeed I think common politeneſs requires it , the contents must be such as your own good Sense & better Heart shall dictate .
