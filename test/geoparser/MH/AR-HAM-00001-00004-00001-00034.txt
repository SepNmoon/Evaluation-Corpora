Dear Mrs. Dickenson , My Daughter had the pleasure of your letter a few days ago , & she desires me to aſsure you that she is sensible of your goodneſs to her & wou 'd not have deferr 'd writing to you had I not informed her that I proposed myself that pleasure immediately to thank you & Mr. Dickenson for your very great attention & kindneſs to us by your invitation of my Son to paſs some time with you at Taxal , by which I find he is very happy , & I believe he proposes setting out the end of the present week . I shou 'd think myself unworthy the constant attachment & friendship I have experienced from you & Mr. Dickenson were I silent upon the character of your Cousin , which is to me at this moment a subject of the utmost distreſs . You have reason to know the date of his Commiſsion in the 10 th . light Dragoons , since it was mark 'd by an instance of generosity of a Friend of yours that I can never forget . My Son join 'd the Regt . the beginning of last February twelve month & has been constantly with it till within these three weeks , when he obtain 'd leave of absence . I have had the mortification to receive constant complaints of him , for conduct unbecoming an Officer , by keeping low company , negligence of his duty , contracting debts , withdrawing himself from the society of his Brother Officers , under the pretence that it was to avoid drinking , & upon all occasions having a dirty slovenly appearance . Under these circumstances it is no wonder that he is disliked & despised by almost every Officer in the Regt . & had it not been from the particular friendship of General Pitt & the Lieutenant Colonel 's to Mr. Robt . Greville , he wou 'd long since have been desir 'd to withdraw from the Regt . Having by an uncommon quick succeſsion attain 'd the Rank of eldest Cornet , he might in a few weeks have succeeded by purchase to a Lieutenancy , which I have not only been obliged to decline but to take him out of the Regt voluntarily , apprehending that I might soon be obliged to do it by neceſsity , as upon examination I found the complaints too well founded with respect to his conduct in the Regt . Tho ' I allow 'd him two Hundred Pounds a year in addition to his pay , & sent him to the Regt . well provided in every respect & without debt , he now leaves the Army without reputation & much in debt , to save his credit as much as poſsible I have agreed to pay his Debts , a list of which he gave me upon honor as being the whole amount of them , but he is now as he has ever been a stranger to truth & honor for I am daily making discoveries of engagements he has enter 'd into for very large Sums for things unnecessary & which it wou 'd be impoſsible for him to discharge for instance , I made a discovery yesterday that he had bespoke a watch for which he was to pay £70.0.0 A few days ago I discover 'd that he had given promiſsory Drafts payable in a few months for one hundred & five Guineas for a Phaeton , in which he proposed making his appearance at Taxal ; the Horses wou 'd have been an other great expence , however I have had the addreſs to persuade the man to keep his Phaeton which is not worth more than £ 25 . & the Drafts which are now in my poſseſsion . Judge of the painfu l state of my mind in the recollection of having a Son so totally devoid of truth honesty & common sense , what can be done with such a subject ? He is very desirous that I shou 'd permit him to go to Germany after his visit at Taxal , I think I shall not agree to it as I have not the smallest confidence in him . As for having him in my house with such principles , what cou 'd be expected but continual discord ? Palombi has communicated to me his expected happineſs ; if Miſs D . resembles her Br . in any respect O Derbyshire ! supply the rest yourself Remember me most affectionately to Mr D . & believe me your Affect . Uncle Frederick Hamilton July 12 th . 1791 N o . 19 . Orchard St . Portman Sqr . Since my writing the within complaints of Rt . I have been informed that he had countermanded the order for the watch before his final disclosure to me of the whole amount of his debts , so that in that single Article only there is room for some little extenuation . none of the particulars shou 'd be mention 'd to him , it only lead him to falsify I must insist my Dear Mrs. Dickenson , if you shou 'd find him in the least troublesome that you will give me a hint & he shall be withdrawn immediately & the secret kept . I wou 'd not let him come with either Servant or horse P.S . Pray acquaint Mr. Dickenson that as soon as Robert s Succeſsor lodges the money for the Cornetcy I shall be ready to discharge my Debt to him with the Interest that will be due in October ; this is but just on my part as I have avail 'd myself so much of Mr. D . 's kindneſs . Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
