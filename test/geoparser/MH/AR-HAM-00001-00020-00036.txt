Tewin Water 6 th . August 1780 . For once , My Dear Sister , you have discovered an amazing want of penetration . You suppose my Heart to be wounded -- beleive me it is not made of such inflammable matter as you seem to suspect , & if it was , the danger from the Herts Beauties is not very alarming , but to confeſs the truth , I am not quite clear that it has renounced it 's allegiance to M. L . The idea of her intrudes upon my recollection in my solitary walks more frequently than I could wish . I like the letter from D——shire . It leaves you at liberty to pursue your own inclinations . Your situation is delicate , your prudence great . I think you must now either accept or absolutely refuse the offer . I proposed the plan of visiting East Bourne to Lady Cathcart . She was pleased with your attention and I beleive very little persuasion would have made her agree to the expedition . Her trip into Eſsex will take place in a fortnight . I have attempted to keep her at home but without effect . I fear changing Beds at her time of Life may be attended with bad consequences ; however she is determined ( I might have said obstinate ) & I am obliged to be quiet . The Atholls did not aquaint her of the Birth of thier Daughter -- This is the first time of their neglecting it to do so -- She went so far as to say , that she imagined They did not approve of my making my Visit so long at Tewin . I wish they would not be so careleſs of her ; a little civility would please . I am rejoiced to hear of your Bathing , that it will certainly do you good -- it will brace your Nerves & prevent Feverets in Winter . Riding on horseback is good lik ewise good , when people like it ; for my part I seldom affront my feet . Now & then I venture to drive an open Chaise with one old blind Cart Horse , but this is only upon very particular occasions . You did not tell me whether the August Birthday is to be publick or private ; however it is of little consequence as I do not intend to be present . Adieu . Beleive me Your 's very sincerely & Affectionately N Ld- Napier 6 Augst . 1780 . 3 4 2 2 2 2 2
