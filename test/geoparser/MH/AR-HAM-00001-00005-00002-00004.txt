Wandsworth hill Sepr . 7 th - As I have yet received no answer from my dear Mi≈øs Hamilton I take for granted one of our Letters has been lost by the way -- in case mine shou 'd not have arrived at Windsor I think it right to repeat the subject of my last -- I was desired by Papa & Lady Stormont to tell you how much they wish for the pleasure of your company at the little Boy 's Christening which is to be either to morrow or Sunday se'nnight , they will not fix the day till they know which will be most convenient & agreeable to you & beg you will give their Compts . to Coll . Greville & desire he will keep himself unengaged for that occasion -- I hope with all my heart you will be able to contrive to come here as it will make us all very happy to have the pleasure of seeing you and none more so than yr . very affecte- Elizath . M. Murray -- Ly . Stormont & c are all perfectly well -- Be so kind to send me a line by the bearer
