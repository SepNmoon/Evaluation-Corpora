Berkley Square Dec . 22 d . 1789 . Dear Madam Some time ago I received a brace of woodcocks labelled with a name so friendly , that I am sure I can only be obliged to Mr Dickenson & you for so kind a remembrance . It does not look very gratefull when I am so late in my gratitude -- but I was out of town & have been so till last week , & neither knew how to direct to you , nor where to learn . On the very night that I arrived , I drove to Norfolk street -- but alas ! Miſs Clarke was removed , whither was not known , but was beleived at Sunning . I thence went to melancholy Clarges Street , Edmund was as ignorant ; but yesterday informed me I shoud find Miſs Clarke in Conduit street , & so I did last night , & she gave me a direction , & acquainted me that Mr Dickenson has been out of order but is quite recovered -- so my joy is pure she gave me another pleasure , the hope of seeing you this spring , & I trust , with your sweet little girl much growing & improved . I have been so few days in town , that I can give you very imperfect accounts of our Friends , The poor dear Vesey is quite Childish , but thence not at all unhappy , which , with the great care taken of her , is the best we coud hope . Mrs Carter comes next monday ; Miſs More is at Hampton , but not coming this month . A person , who lives opposite to Hampton Court , is in a very dangerous way , & suffers terribly , but I do not beleive disordered , as reported . I am a bad newsmonger , & if there is any , do not know it ; and therefore , as I can not entertain you , I will not tire you , when my sole reason for writing was to thank you & Mr Dickenson , & to seize that opportunity of aſsuring you that I am as much as ever Dear Madam yr much obliged & most sincere humble Sert HWalpole To Mrs Dickenson at Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire .
