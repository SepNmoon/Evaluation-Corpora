7 th May 1789 I have been my dear Friend intendi n g every day to write to you tho ' I have not heard from you of an absolute age never indeed in answer to my last letter , but my good intentions upon this subject as upon many others , have been detourne ed & divertd from been put into execution by the various constant occurences of the day & moment -- I wish I could say or think I was occupied -- that would be accounting for my time and silence in a manner I should not be ashamed of -- no what one does from mor n i n g to night here deserves not to be dignified with by the na me of occupation , it is hurry , it is a something that carries with it the appearance of importance , the force of neceſsity , but which is vain , empty & unsatisfactory -- such as it is however it demands the attention & fills up the day of the miserable Beings who are confined to this place ; & must account as well as it can , or you will allow it , for my not doi n g the things I like & prefer , & in this instance particularly for not having written to you -- besides my dear Friend I have been tormented for this month past with a rheumat ic pain in my face , I have had a Blyster on & have been out of Town -- My Father has been confined these 6 weeks past with the Gout duri n g 3 of which I never stirred in an Evening -- he has been for a week at Horton is returned , is goi n g in a fortnight to Harrowgate for a Month which will bring him & us to the end of June when thanked be God we shall be at Horton ! it is impoſsible to tell you my dear Friend ! to expreſs the disgust the abhorrence I have conceived for this place it has been growing these some years & now is arrived at a degree that makes it quite insupp ortable Oh ! that something would happen to take me quite out of it ! I am now in a violent longing fit for the Country -- I was interrupted in this letter my dear Friend the other day & now resume it & mean to conclude it before I set out for Richmond , where I am going for some days . Never was anythi n g so heavenly & enchanting as the weather , I am sitti n g with my window open hearing the Birds sing & absolutely seei n g the leaves burst into life -- nothi n g can be prettier I really think than the scene before me -- I must not however indulge myself in description , but tell you somethi n g more to the purpose about myself or rather ourselves -- My Brother is gone abroad for a year -- he went on Tuesday sev'night & we have already heard from him from Paris where he arrived safe after a good paſsage & pleasant journey , & where the concourse of People who were collected on account of the aſsemblée des notables was so great that it was wth the utmost difficulty , he could get a Lodgi n g in any Hôtel -- I believe he means to remain there a Month or six Weeks , it will depend on Circumstances . you will perhaps often hear my dear Friend that the Ki n g is ill -- do not believe a word of it -- God be thanked he is as well as I & all such sincere Lovers of his as I am , wish him he feels weak and exhausted -- how natural , how inevitable after such an illneſs -- he told me so on the day we went to St. Pauls -- a day I shall never forget as long as I live -- I went to the Q s House first of course -- Miſs Gunning was in the next room & as soon as he saw me he came out to speak to me -- this was th e first time I had seen him -- when he spoke my knees trembled my tongue faultered & I could not utter a word but burst into a violent fit of tears -- this was a bad beginni n g to such a day -- I never saw anythi n g so grand so stupendous so imposant as the Building of St Pauls , or so affecti n g , & so Solemn as the whole Service -- we all walked in proceſsion thro ' th e isle amidst the songs of 5000 Children -- the Sermon was preached by the K . & the finest I d ever heard I did nothi n g but cry the whole time , you can conceiv e nothi n g so affecti n g -- the Ki n g was devout & attentive as usual Porteus much affected -- the Queen the Prince of W . ; laughi n g immoderatly the whole time -- every other Person impreſsed with the awfulneſs of the place & the occasion -- as to me I had not recovered the effect of the day a week afterwa rds I remember promising to give you some account of the Ball at Whites -- it was indeed magnificent & perfectly well conducted -- the Pantheon was lit up with enclosed Lamps -- & the effect of every woman bei n g in white & gold was a very remarquably good one -- Brook s Ball was at the Opera -- magnificent they said , but not pleasant as the crowd was amazi n g -- neither D. of Y . nor I were there owi n g to an idea of Bell 's objecti n g to her Friend 's bei n g there -- this original one was altered afterwards , but then we had given away our Tickets & it was too late -- the Club of Boodles give a Ball at Ranalaugh on this occasion -- the French & Spanish Ambaſsadors are to be magnif ic the Queen goes & we attend her -- Good God how sick I am of it all -- I am leaing to draw flowers of the Queen Mr Brown s Man & have had my first leſson to day & think I shall like it vastly -- you shall have my first decent production -- I have as yet not seen Ly Wake , but at this minute she rings the Bell & is comi n g up -- we have called on each other several times with London succeſs -- ie never meeti n g -- Adieu my very dear Friend -- write to me -- tell me that Ly Wake is well -- that dear little Mr D . grows & speaks & is not spoilt -- and a great deal about yourself -- Louisa begs her best love to you , she talks of bei n g at Courteenhall the first week in June -- happy -- she -- God bleſs you once more my dear Friend -- I long to hear from you -- pray write soon -- I hope all is well chès vous -- Saturday 9 th May .
