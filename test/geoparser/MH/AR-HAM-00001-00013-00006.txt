Dear Miranda 's two friends have read her obliging letter with the moſt cordial satisfaction . Her pictures of the various objects environing her preſent reſidence merit high admiration ; but much higher pleaſure -- reſults from the conſideration of her preſent unconſtrain 'd felicity : more pleaſing , more heart-felt still were the paternal senſations , which affected the writer of this , when he first learn 'd , that no reply had been made to Miranda 's important diſpatches to a certain quarter a few days preceding her departure from London . Among many vexations , which have lately surrounded me , the peculiar embarraſsment of your situation , my dear child , was not the leaſt of my sufferings . I truſt you are now set free , and that I may be truly thankful at my releaſe from one part of my anxiety . Paſs 'd experience will befriend you better , than any advice I can give ; and that you may in future keep a strict watch over the unſuſpecting generoſity of your own heart is the fervent wiſh of your affectionate RGlover . P.S . Mrs. Glover unites with me in love & sentiments . Mr. Glover July 15 : 1780 Miſs Hamilton
