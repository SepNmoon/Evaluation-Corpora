As Mr : Wye 's Servant did not deliver me Miſs Hamilton 's Note 'till this morning at Breakfaſt , it was not in my power to obey her Commands before . -- These are all the Letters of the Chriſtian I thought worth the keeping . -- The Others being only a temporary Criticiſm on a late Publication , I have destroy 'd . -- As I ſuppose Miſs Hamilton is too well confirmed in the Principles of her Religion , ever to be converted to my Faith , I do not apprehend -- ſhe runs any riſk of being ſtagger 'd in her Belief , by a ſecond peruſal of Opinions on little else than the Form of our Public prayers . -- I should otherwise not have ſent them , -- for , ( besides that it is not my Profeſsion to make Converts , ) when one people change their Tenets , it ought to be entirely by the ſtrength of their own Underſtanding , or they will by the change endanger their future Peace of Mind . -- I was glad to hear by Thomas ( whom I met this morning ) that Mrs : & Miſs Hamilton were well .
