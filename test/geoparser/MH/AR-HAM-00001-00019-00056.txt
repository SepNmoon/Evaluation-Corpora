Edinburgh Octr 11 th - 1773 I had the pleaſure of recieving My dear Ward s Letter of the 5 th instant after so very long a ſilence that I thought you had lost yourself in the Wilds of Kent however I am extremely glad to find you & Lady Wake returned home & in so good health after so much diſsipation , but as you are aſsamed of yourself I shall not scold about your not writing ſooner , as I suppose such a neglect to your Guardian wont happen again & I order the Siroce Winds to blow in Italy and never preſume appearing at Northampton at least at Hamilton House for the future , so they will be no excuse after this , but must own I did not percieve they had done any harm by yours however believe me we are extremely sorry about your Earach & hope by this time you have sent it about its buſineſs as I am sure it had none plaguing you you desire our opinion about your London journey with Mrs Hamilton after Christmas and which My dear Lady Wake you shall have wtout the least disguise . With a Lady of so good a Character as Mary has , I can ſee no reason for denying yourself a Months amusement in London , tho I can not ſay I would advise a constant residence there or indeed in any place where so constant a round of nonſenſical absurd doings are continually going on , that nobody in their senſes could have patience with . As for the breach of Duty you mention that must be entirely left to your own feelings , tho I can not think your Mama can ever think so , as you ſay she ſeems much pleased wt it , & on the contrary that it distreſses you , had it been the reverse to wit had it pleased you and distreſsed her I should then have advised Northampton instead of London as I should be ſorry to see you deſire a thing contrary to your Mama s opinion , so I think on the whole you may without the least anxiety leave Lady Wake for a Month but would advise you to stay no longer tho MrsMiſs Hamilton should be perswaded to give you leave for a little time more as she may wt pleasure give the first leave , the second be aſsured will be given with reluctance whatever face may be put upon it & very natural it should be so . One thing I beg you 'll remember above all things , never on any condition to go to any publick place without Mrs Hamilton & indeed to as few private places as you can without her & never make any great intimacys with the London Miſses as they are above all Miſses the most hatefull in my humble opinion & I have the honor to be acquainted with many whos behaviour is reckoned to be faultleſs & whos Characters are admired by the beau monde , tho I should be extremely ſorry had I not a much higher opinion of My dear Ward then I have of any of them so My dear Lady Wake dont let your Good nature run away with a good opinion of people till you are quite acquaint with their Characters which is not eaſy where people are bred up from the Cradle to diſsemble their thoughts & where a ſort of affected politeneſs paſses for good Nature and amiableneſs & hides often a very very bad heart . Now My dearest Girl you have both our opinions about your London Scheme so I shall go on to anſwer the rest of your letter -- My Health continues on the mending hand & tho I have ſome times r e turns of a pain in my stomach yet on the whole I think I am better at present than I have been for Six Years past & am in greater spirits than you ever ſaw me in & am quite fit for your ſaucineſs , was I with you , you should ſee that I would keep it in fine order by being twenty times more ſaucy than your ſaucy Ladyship could be for your Life so Madam you may let your Mama know that I could keep you in few order was I at Northampton , but that can not happen this year of God without some time very extraordinary should fall out -- I must own that you saw very right when you ſaw me shake my head abt , Mary & controversy , but I did not make use of the perverse Gipsey not but that I agree with you in thinking it might have been proper to have ſaid it , had it been polite ; I am glad Fanchon is well as I hope Cloe & Fairry is are so too , tho ' you do not mention the two last -- I agree with you that there is a good deal of Satire in Beatie s verses , tho I must think there is likeways a great deal of truth in them likeways and I have hinted ſuch things formerly when writing about a certain Lady s learning Latin . I do not propose seeing town this Winter which I regreate as I should have had the pleaſure of meeting you & of being introduced to Sir Wm Wake & Sir Wm whom I am very ambitious of knowing from the good Character I have heard of them from you & other people -- Lady Wake s family are all well in the Country & will certainly be in London this Winter tho its not as yet fixed when they set out , Ld Cathcart is appointed Maid of Honor to Miſs Cathcart in the most flattering manner poſsible & without any bodys knowing of a vacancy it is in the room of the Queen who is going to be married to Miſs Keck . I knew a daughter of Lord Hereford s at a boarding school in Norwich many years ago , but he told me th e n he never had been maried to the Mother , nor do I imagine had she been his Wife she would not have decamped so eaſily as she did by what you ſay . I am greatly obliged to you for sending the ring and Book to Capt . Atkinſon s & I have ordered them to be called for , but my dearest Mr- Ruſsell I will not let you off the Picture that you promised me before mary and as you will be in London this Winter a word to the wise is enough and I charge you to remember me in the moſt respectfull way to her & return her my most ſincere thanks for being so good as to remember me -- Miracles are are not ceased ſince Mrs- Rogers dont viſit at your house but I can not ſay I am very ſorry for it from what you told me when at Northampton and if she continues in the ſame stile I think the connexion better broke off than continued . I am ſorry Miſs Kingford is still obliged to remain at Northampton & am afraid he will not ſoon make it up with his Father & friends as they take not the least notice or ever speak of him I have given them ſeveral hints that I was a Week at Northampton with you but they allowed the ſubject to drop and did not mention him in the least so I imagine from all that , things are worse than he ſeems to think as he was in hopes that the storm would ſoon blow over and that they were only giving him a bite of the bridle but I am of a quite different opinion as I am now perswaded they are very much offended at him which I am extremely ſorry for as I think time is paſsing away which might be a great deal better employed than walking the Streets & environs of the sweet Mr- Hope I hear is come to Scotland but I have not seen him nor indeed any of your acquaintance in the Queens Dragoons as I have been very little about ſince I came to Scotland but I hear of their giving a County a Ball and they returned it a few day ago so you see they do not regreat Northamptonshire so much as Colonel Bland does them Mrs- Thursby & my three eldest joins me in best Compliments to you & Lady Napier & believe me My dearest Mrs Hamilton to be most affectionately yours . If Mary s- verses had not been added yours would not have been half so long a Letter as this remember that Madam adieu .
