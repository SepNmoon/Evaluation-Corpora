Edinburgh 30 th . May 1784 My Dear Sister , Tho ' you obstinately persisted in refusing to write first to me when I was a Bachelor , yet I flattered myself the respect due to my exalted Station as a Benedict would have induced You to throw away a few of your leisure Minutes in writing to me . Having been disappointed in this hope & Providence having pleased to decree that this should be a rainy Morning I have taken up my Pen to aſsure You that You have frequently been the subject of my thoughts and Conversation since we parted . My Maria loves & esteems You and regrets much the distance which prevents her cultivating an acquaintance and friendship with You . You have the sincere good wishes of both of Us -- Our journey we made out easily , & as the Weather proved favourable , pleasantly . I had the satisfaction to find that all my friends approved of My choice and I can safely say tho ' I have been married Seven Weeks , I have never once experienced an unpleasant Moment . Maria 's temper is calm and equal , accommodating to all my whims which I can aſsure You are not few . She appears contente d with everything and studies to do everything all in her power to make me happy So much for myself & Wife . Mrs. Hunter expects to be confined every hour . A t present her circumference more resembles S t . Paul 's Church than any other object I can recollect . Harriot is the happies t creature in the World and paſses mos t of her time with Us . Maria has taken a particular Attachment to her , which gives me the greatest pleasure , for entre Nous I wish to take her out of Mrs- Hunter 's hands and to fix her with Us . I shall not however mention this Scheme to any of the Parties 'till I am obliged to go to Ireland . The style of Company She sees with the Hunter 's is not exactly what I approve of , and not such as I should wish her to chuse a Helpmate from . Adieu my Dear Sister . Write to me soon & long . Tell me everything about Yourself and believe me ever Your very sincere and a ffecti onate friend & brother Miſs Hamilton Clarge s Street London
