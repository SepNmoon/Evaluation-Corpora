Bath ye 14 th . Decr . 1777 Dear Miranda My own recovery since my arrival at this place hath not produc 'd a satiſfaction without alloy to myſelf ; who , growing well , had the mortification of seeing at the same time the character of invalid tranſferr 'd from me to my two companions , poor wife and poor dove . Confin 'd for a whole week by severe colds , one hung her head , the other dropp 'd her wing ; the moſt brilliant sunſhine would often entice them to the windows , which command the whole extent of our delightful situation in the Circus ; there they saw a large circumference all alive & crouded with hats , cloaks , capuchins , petticoats , ribbons and shoestrings of all colours in sprightly motion to the morning diverſions ; in the evening they heard the repeated cry of chair , chair , all in a hurry to balls , concerts , theatre , cards & c a : they saw , & each sat like a Patience on a monument , though not always smiling on grief ; they heard , till they were tir 'd , & then were very glad to hear me read to them , while they plied the needle . A propos ; what book think you , my dear Shakespeare , was read to them by your most devoted though utterly forgotten slave ? The life & adventures of Robinſon Cruſoe -- The wolves are in the firſt volume ; Miranda hath loſt her wager ; she hath not paid it ; and what is worſe , my taking up the pen firſt irretrievably diſables her from ever diſcharging an obligation of juſtice ; and of conſcience . Sweet saint ! have no recourſe to juſtification Truſt to penitence alone , whoſe healing dews can remove the only speck upon your purity in this firſt inſtance of tranſgreſsion ! To my rightful claim the governeſs of this houſe , and Miranda join their fervent petition , that you will let us hear from you soon , as an attonement to me , & a gratification to their affectionate solicitude . All unite in compliments to Lieutenant governeſs Dove & you . Believe me Dr . Mrs. Hamilton Your moſt faithful & cordial friend & servt . Miranda P.S . If lovely R Glover be return 'd , embrace her in behalf of all here , I mean my own houſe , not all Bath ; we are too much diſpos 'd to keep her to ourſelves Catherine Author of Leonidas & c .
