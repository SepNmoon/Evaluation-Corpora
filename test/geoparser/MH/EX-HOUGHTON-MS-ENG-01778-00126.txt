Bristol 24 June My dear Friend The reasons why I did not write to you on friday evening from Devizes were threefold , as M r . Vellum says . In the first place there was no post went out that night ; secondly I did not stay at Devizes as I had proposed , but came on to Bath to sleep , a nd thirdly I did not meet Joseph Addison , as the e xtreme badneſs of the weather prevented his c oming to me , a loſs I regretted the leſs , as I d id not paſs the evening there . I had not t he bonne fortune to see the first Edition of t hat excellent Epigram on the Window , which Dr. Stonhouse directed me to search out . -- My regret at leaving London was rendered much more lively by having spent the last day of my sejour there so delightfully . And yet it was very pleasant to me to revolve in my mind the kind and affectionate manner in which I was taken leave of by so many amiable and excellent persons whom I so warmly love and esteem . -- That my friends often flatter me , I am perswaded I ought to believe , and yet I cordially embrace all their kindneſs to me upon Hamlet 's principle -- “ Why what preferment can they hope from me ” ? Mr. Pepys Hamlet 3.2 . I staid at Bath the greatest part of Saturday , but cou 'd not find an opportunity to see Shakespeare , Miſs Cooper , or any of my acquaintance , because I devoted all my time to shew Miſs Bowdler whatever was worth seeing at Bath . I called however on Miſs Cadogan , but had not the good luck to find her at home . Apropros of Mrs. Thrale pray dont forget to mention how Mrs. Thrale does when you write , as I wish much to know how he does , and he is , by his late offence , so disconnected with most of my friends , that I have few opportunities of hearing any thing of him . Pray say something handſome and affectionate for me to dear Johnson , and tell Mrs. Vesey I was very well entertained with the Poem he was so good to give me . I think there are a great many pretty lines in it , especially in the first Part . What have you done with yourself since we parted ? Did you go to Wimpole Street the next evening ? I expect a particular detail of all your adventures . Remember I am now in a place where I depend entirely on the charity of my absent friends for entertainment and information . I shall think of you on Saturday . What a charming Party will you be ! And you will be all so agreeable to , and so worthy of each that I cant in reason and conscience expect that a stray thought shou 'd now and then wander towards Bristol . At four o'clock I shall say to myself now they are sitting down to dinner -- at seven -- now they are in the Temple watching the effect of the declining Sun on the Silver Bridge , and at eight -- now they are all separated , and if I had seen them I shou 'd now see them no more -- So paſs away the pleasures of this World . this World . Besure say not a word about the Academy Story . except to those You desired Mr. Vesey & Mr. P . I feel very sensibly the honour that respectable Aſsembly has done , me but there is something so ridiculous in the idea , of an ignorant , and above all of a female Academician that I cou 'd not stand it if it were generally known . Write soon to your ever faithful and affectionate Mrs. C . H. More Queens Square
