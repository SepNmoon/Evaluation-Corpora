8 o'Clock -- Monday Morng . Novbr . 8 th - 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , my Friend , It is impoſsible for me , such is my attachment to you to be separated from you a single Day without feeling ye same regret , as I shd .. at being separated from another friend for a whole Month . Yes my Miranda I am more & more every day convinced , yt . nothing but ye hand of Death can put an end to my affection for you & not even that if our Souls hereafter in their immortal ſtate are allowed to be guided by ye same sensations , as they are here in their mortal . I hope M. G——g 's The name blanked by the Prince as ‘ G-g ’ and later erased is surely that of Miss ( Charlotte ) Gunning . Hamilton writes a note to Gunning ( part of HAM/1/15/2/1 ( 2 ) ) on probably the very day the present letter was received , dismissing as hearsay something that Gunning has told her about ‘ Osyiris ’ ; these are most likely the preesentiments [ sic ] that the Prince refers to . Hamilton 's undated note is pasted to a letter dated 8 November , to which a pencilled '1779 ? ' has been added . Even if the links in this chain of inference are not all equally strong , the identification remains persuasive . Preesentiments will be nothing but mere preesentiments , let not yr . delicate spirits be too much cast down , do not if you will allow me to say so , do not for my sake , if you will not for yr . own , do not dwell too much , or indulge yrself in thinking over melancholy ideas , banish ym—— from yt . dear bosom where gaiety ought always to reign . Remember you once promised me you wld .. once follow this advice of mine as much as it was in yr . power , but I am afraid you have not ſtuck so closely to yr . word in this inſtance as you do in every other . My Miranda will pardon me , for blaming her in one instance of her conduct Y——y when my M——r , it was about sending me back ye . Seal cld .. had she opened my Letter before she had sent it back she wld .. have seen my reason for sending it , but cld .. she suppose yt . after ye firm & disinterested declaration she made to me yt . she wld .. receive no more presents . I wld .. dare to force my her delicacy , No my friend , I have begun to learn what delicacy is from you , I will copy you to my utmost , tho ' I can not equal you , O cld .. I flow like thee , & make thy ſtream My great example , as it is my theme , Though deep , yet clear , tho ' gentle yet not dull Strong without rage , without o er flowing full . Sir John Denham , Cooper 's Hill ( 1642 , 1655 , 1688 ) , section on the River Thames . Since I wrote ye . end of ye . last Page I finished ye . Man of Feeling I cld .. not help dropping a tear a t o Harley 's fate such is ye . happy death of ye . virtuous . Oh great God ! if I am soon to die may I thus die in ye . arms of my bleſsed & ever dearest Miranda . But our lives my Miranda are to last longer in order to undergo a great er mixture of pleasures & pains than they as yet have , however they our Souls are perfectly united & yt . I hope we shall both find a great comfort thro'out our Journey . I have one word more to say before I quit such melancholy Topics , I admire ye Book extremely & have not found a single paſsage yt . is any wise beautiful yt . was not already marked by yr . Pencil , but I think it an improper Book for you read during yr . present melancholy train of ideas , ( I tell you honestly my ideas ) I think it is too sentimental for you in yr . present state of mind , yr . tender heart , wants no additional sting to make it feel . it is but too much softned already , however allow me once more to add yt . if you have any affection for me you will endeavour as much as is in yr . power to banish such melancholy thoughts from yr . bosom . Allow me now to turn to a more trivial subject , you must know I have received my Tabinet from Ireland by ye means of L——y C——n I send you a Patern of it , I intend to make it up for New year 's day with a white Ermine Lining with a White Sattin Waistcoat embroidered with Cheneel ( I do not know how to spell yt word ) and to embroider ye . Coat also with Cheneel , without any Gold & Silver in it , now I wish to know whether you wld : like ye Coat best , plain or with a light Cheneel embroidery , tell me fairly yr . opinion , ( pugh I offend you in asking you to do so for I know you always will do so to me , ) consider only ye . Coat is for a Gala Day , they will be both equally full dreſsed . Adieu Adieu , Adieu my Miranda , my best & dearest Friend , & Sister may you ever be under ye . peculiar care of Heaven , & may you enjoy every bleſsing yr . Virtues deserve , I am ever Your Palemon . toujours de même P.S . I have taken ye . liberty of adding a little Motto to ye . Book tell me in yr . next if you think it well applied . Pray let me receive a Note from my dearest Miranda 's hand at my return be it ever so short . encore Ad . Ad . toujours chére
