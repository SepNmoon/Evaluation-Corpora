Hill the American Captain who took us , & poor Capt . Dillon whom he had taken , he poor Man look 'd very Melancholy , but every body was complimenting Capt . Hill upon his humane & generous behaviour to us , we hope in a few days to get leave to go to Oporto in Portugal , & to get some Ship to convey us from thence to England , but I hope You will never expect me now till You see me , you will believe my greatest grief in being taken was being so long from seeing my dear litle Lambs & from either seeing or hearing any thing of Your dear dear Papa , we were oblig 'd to sail from Lisbon June 17 th - before the other Packet came in , so I have heard nothing of any body I love since May 15 th - give my love to dear Lady Louisa , & tell her I fea r it may be still a Month before I can Thank her at Harleyford for all her goodness & c You can not think what a comfort I have in being with Mr . & Mrs. Graham & c Copy of Mrs Fielding s letter to Miſs Fielding Copy of Mrs .
