Strawberry hill July 1 st . 1785 . Mr Walpole begs to know if Thursday or Friday next will be agreeable to Mrs Dickinson to dine at Strawberry hill , when he hopes to have the pleasure of seeing Mr Dickinson too & the two Miſses Clarke , whom he begs Mrs Dickinson to ask , & he will send to Mrs Garrick as soon as he knows the day . He fears it is not proper to ask Mrs Vesey yet , or he shoud be most happy to see Her & Mrs Hancock ; but he woud not propose any thing to dear Mrs Vesey , if it is not quite right . P.S He directs to Miſs Clarke 's lest the Postman not having been at the wedding , shoud mistake M r . Walpole , J uly 1st 1785 To Mrs Dickinson at Miſs Clarke 's in Clarges Street [ IS ] LEWORTH
