30 th . August 1791 London Tuesday -- After dinner we all went to J Dickenson s & saw 8 or 9 Portraits of Romney , not one of which satisfied me -- we drank tea with her -- & then the Emma & I went to Cr . 's to get the matters adjusted respecting the Money , we did not return till past 9 -- Sr. Rt . Herries went home when we separated from AMaria -- Emma told me that he had just recd . a letter from Sr Robert who had altered her plans & meant to go to Taxal when She quitted Buxton -- therefore I hope to be at home now when She is there -- Wedn : At 9 I went to Lincolns Inn fields on the Ly H . s . Acct . -- from thence to Cr- s for Some Cash for him & to other places -- in my Way I called upon Sir Rt . Herries who seems very well -- She has two Girls -- both She & her Husband look old -- last night when the Mrs. Johnstone was gone to bed I took an Oppy of talking to her Cr . & recommended to her a Line of Conduct that I wished her to persue -- at 11 Eliza 's Mother came here & repeating her profeſsions of kind Offices ( which I have no doubt will be realized if neceſsary ) took a very friendly leave of her -- As soon as Emma went to Court & Sir Wm . left Ld . & amp ; Lady Malmsbury , She came thrō a very heavy rain to take leave of Emma -- I was so much affected after our conversation last Night , tho I had only answers of Monosyllables , that I could not sleep -- & to day I felt a great deal at the thoughts of parting with a Sister , probably for ever -- Eliza drank a Glaſs or two of Wine & without saying one Affecte . Word to me -- without mentioning Father Sister or Niece or friend She went into her Carriage & with the utmost Sang froid adjusted the Blinds & c -- This was too much for me -- Eliza came back to me & exclaimed -- “ My God ! Emma -- is this poſsible -- I am glad & I am sorry to see with what Philosophy She bears this Separation -- how She must love this Man to leave all her dearest Relations with so much composure ” -- She left a little Dab of a Letter for you sealed -- Yours my dear friend of the 27 th arrived a few minutes before they went , I read to Mr. D . what related to her Father & Sister -- She talked cheerfully of them , but left no endearing meſsage for them -- Can this Creature have feelings or of what Nature are they ? She never mentioned E . since we left Taxal -- Adieu to Louisa -- The Elizabeth sent you many Compts- he seemed glad to get away & poor Cr . will have a bad beginning as it has never ceased raining since morng -- Samuel will write to you very soon She is gone to Tonbridge -- I have just recollected that I am to dine with Lady Wake to day to meet Devaynes -- I was very near forgetting it as my head is so confused -- I am afraid Lord Cremorne s aversion to Mr. H—— is too well founded & I fear he poſseſses great duplicity & no share of honor & common honesty -- as I shall have a proposal made to me in form respecting him , write a few lines by return of post to give me yr- Sentiments dont mention Names or any thing particular . as I may probably not receive the letter -- Robert told me yt the marriage is to take place on Sunday . therefore I shall not leave town till this day Sent -- A Demur was made by the Emma about a special licence owg to an expreſsion in AB——p of Canty . 's application therefore it must be solemnized in a Church -- Sir Wm- is very anxious about it -- & his Wife is dying -- therefore they are afraid lest he shd . be prevented from attending -- I have been out of luck in not meetg this person -- but on that day I shall have the best introduction poſsible -- When I saw Ld . Abern .. I gave him a preſsing invitation to Taxal , & he seemed pleased I am prevented from adding another Line , except to tell you that I have taken these Lodggs on till next Wedy . -- Adieu best of Women Adieu -- Cs .
