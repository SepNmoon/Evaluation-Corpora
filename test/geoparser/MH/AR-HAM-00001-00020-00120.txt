Wilton Lodge , 2 d . March 1793 . My Dear Sir , Some Resolutions paſsed , in the Committee of Privileges , last Monday , give Me a very broad hint , that my Right of Franking will cease in a very few days . Therefore , to save your Pence , not from a Cacoethes scribendi ; ( for I am really not very partial to the Amusement of Writing ) I hasten to answer your Letter . Their Lordships of the Committee , have Unanimously resolved , that my Right to the Title of Napier is perfectly good . Even those who were pleased to attack my Dignities , were obliged to acknowledge their inability to sustain their objections . But , tho ' this was well known from the beginning , yet , it has cost Me upwards of £170 , which I have no hopes of getting back from my Enemies , and so They have punished Me pretty severely , for presuming to differ in opinion with them . My misfortunes do not stop here , for the same Committee having found , that one of my Voters had no claim to the Title he had aſsumed , and repelled some objections I had stated to the Voting of Lord Kinnaird , it becomes certain that I shall lose my Election , for Alas ! there is another of my Noble Voters , who I fear , will likewise be turned off the Roll . And then comes the worst part of the Story , viz . The Solicitors Bill ( for my share of the General Expenses , which I have heard amount to some Thousand Pounds in groſs , & consequently will cost one individually 3 or 400 £ P ounds , if not more ) . So much for Ambition . Had matters turned out more to my wishes , I should have had great satisfaction in making Taxal , in my way to London . We shall be very happy to see You & Yours next May , or whenever it is convenient for You . Maria says , she rejoices You do n't come sooner , because our Trees would not be in Leaf , and She has now lived so long in Scotland , that she feels an interest in the Country appearing well , in the Eyes of Strangers . Tho ' Mrs- Dickenson may have read the Rights of Women , yet being a Valiant & Sturdy Knight of Nova Scotia , I think myself still equal to keeping her in Order , and if She attempts to corrupt the Allegiance of my Wife , there is an excellent Cascade , near the House , under which She may be soused , till She cries peccavi . Ever My Dear Sir , Yours very Sincerely Napier . My Dear Sister , You need be under no apprehensions of meeting with any of the Blue Stocking Tribe in this habitation . We are all downright Country Folks , staring with our Eyes & gaping with our Mouths , just as all Puts do . Maria has taught my Daughter Mary to read , which She performs very tolerably . I believe , they are now beginning to dabble in French . Mary has very quick parts & a good Memory . Little Anne , has likewise begun to learn her Letters under her Mother 's tuition , but She , now & then , takes an obstinate fit , & so They fight . As for my Son William , I have made him comprehend his Letters & he now reads Gay 's Fables & the Bible . Taking on Me the duty of Godfather , with much pains and labour , I have taught him to repeat his Catechism , a few Psalms , & the Busy Bee . And this is a true state of the Erudition of the Family . My young hopeful , to his other accomplishments , has added a happy Stutter , arising from an overeagerneſs to speak , which with an agreeable Twist of the Body , will make him a Charming Young Man . He is full of Mischief , as all Boys are . And so we bid thee farewell , desiring You to believe that we are all sincere Wellwishers of You & Yours . Ever Your Affectionate Brother Napier .
