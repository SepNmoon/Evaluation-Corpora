Dublin Barracks 20 th . Decr- 1784 . My Dear Sister , This letter is on the outside directed to Miſs Hamilton , as neither the Newspapers nor a letter from yourself have announced to me that your name is Dickenson . I hope however that the outside is mistaken and that you have long ago followed the advice I gave you when we last parted . If you have not , I conceive myself still entitled to scold you , but if you should have already obeyed my commands I beg Mr. Dickenson 's pardon for the familiar style in which I addreſs You . I can only excuse myself by calling on you to witneſs that you ever allowed me the privilege of finding fault , a permiſsion which to peevish discontented dispositions like mine , was invaluable . You must likewise do me the Justice to declare that I have ever been ready to avail myself of the slightest opportunities of indulging myself in the exercise of what gives me so much satisfaction . I do not make any apolog ies for not writing to you sooner , as I conceive in strict etiquette you ought to have written to me , but I could not resist the inclination I felt to condole with You & the rest of the Indigo Tribe on the Death of Dr. Johnston . Alas poor Man , he fell a victim to Signora Piozzi 's marriage , therefore I insist if you are not already married , that you will not by a pretended cruelty run the risk of sacrificing Mr. Dickenson . It would certainly make a fine subject for a Poem for the blue Stocking tribe that one of the Society had murdered a deserving young Man . I who flatter myself that I know something of your real disposition can not suspect you of so much cruelty . You can not imagine how happily my dearest Maria & I live . She makes the best of every inconvenience she experiences , is ever chearfull and desirous of making me so . As she has a natural turn for Œconomy we contrive to have every comfort without the folly 's of Life . She never appears so comfortable as when at home and really makes me ( what you will make Mr. D . I beg you obser ve this is the first compliment I ever payed You ) a most rational Companion . She has constantly abused me for not writing to You & now desires me to aſsure you of her most affectionate good wishes . It is now time to tell You that I am on the eve of purchasing the Majority of this Regt- I am now in . Adieu . Beleive me ever , what I have ever been Your very Affece . Brother & sincere friend Napier If you should condescend to write to me , direct King 's Own Regt- of Foot Dublin Barracks Lord Napier Anr Janry 1 st 85 Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street IRELAND
