I am no longer doubtful my friend -- neither shall you any more be tormented with my apprehensions I am sensibly hurt at ye . disagreeable situation you are at present in -- as I put myself in Your place -- & yet , how will my friend be surprised when I tell him I am extremely well satis tis fied that this event has happen 'd -- in this I give a proof of my true affection friendship -- it will teach him more than a dozen pages fill 'd wth . flattering encomiums for I am sorry to tell my friend I too condemn him -- I think I can trace in his account of +++ a remain of paſsion from ye . mortification of his pride having been hurt in ye . unguarded , public accusation I say unguarded accusation because it was both ungrateful & ungenerous , for I am grieved to tell my Friend I have often sigh 'd to be an ear-witneſs of ye . unthinking expreſsions he has frequently made use of before ye . younger part of ye . family -- & yt . I have seen him prompt them to act improperly I however attributed this conduct to an uncommon share of animal spirits , & an inherent turn to ridicule -- I still attribute it to ye . same cause -- but I shall not excuse my friend if it exists any longer -- There are at your age a sufficient number of pursuits to exercise ye . one , & the other must , positively must , be suppreſs 'd p suppreſsd . Your own good sense must point out -- & I know does frequently , yt some persons of an exalted rank lower themselves by a certain unbecoming familiarity , wch by indulging this turn , they are led into & wch . all persons are not charitable enough to attribute to good humour & c & c & c I do not mean by all this to excuse +++ he has behaved as a mean spirited vulgar Boy wld . have done -- I do not think I shd- speak too harshly If I added that I think at times he appears such -- I wish for his sake as well as others yt . he cld . be transplant ed to either Eaton or Westminster . You desire me to advise you how to act -- & you appear in a very amiable light in feeling ye . displeasure of your Mother -- I would have you immediately come to an éclairciſsement -- do not dwell too much upon your vindication -- it is not respectful to a parent to do so -- & believe me she will in her own heart do you ample justice -- but desire her to depend -- ( & if I know my friend if he will say it , he will mean it ) upon your future discretion -- I would not for more than I can expreſs have you continue in under her displeasure -- if you have any affection friendship -- for me prove it do as I desire & let no false pride prevent you r -- I shall be very unhappy till I am certain you are friends Adieu depend upon the eternal duration of my friendship -- . sent Novbr- 6 th Novbr 1779
