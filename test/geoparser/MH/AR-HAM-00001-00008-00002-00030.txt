No . 13 -- True Copy of a Note from Mrs- Bloſsett Saturday Night This being sufficient employment for the present , the rest of the Note shall be deferred till another Opportunity The of Mrs- Dickenson my grattitude the Sigil of the Elegant Epistle further I 've not it but if you it I write so ting well For the last four Nights Miſs A. Clarke has read aloud to us , with a Voice that you probably heard at Birch , tho ' extremely well -- but pronouncing the Letter R. which occur 'd pretty frequently in the Eastern Names so emphatically , that it required pretty strong nerves to support it peaceably -- The Subject was “ Reflections on the Government of Indostan , with a Short Sketch of the History of Bengal from 1738 to 1756 , and an Account of the English Affairs to 1758 -- by Luke Scrafton Esq r - ” -- London -- printed 1763 -- reprinted by W. Strahan Jnr . -- for George Kearsley , in Ludgate Street , and T. Cadell in the Strand , 1780 . ” Miſs Clarke wishes that I should make you acquainted with some of the Names , so I have Picked out the Title given to Lord Clive , as quite sufficient to break as many Teeth as you may have to spare “ Zubdut Ulmulk Nuſseera Dowla Sahbut Jung Bahader ” . -- when Mrs- Dickenson was out of the Room this Morning , I remonstrated with Miſs Clarke on her being so fidgetty , and said that as Mrs- D . had lately been unwell , I thought her manner of taking leave at Night , was very likely to make her Nervous -- upon which she said ( and pray do me credit for keeping my Countenance ) that she earnestly recommended a blister to be put -- on Mrs- D . 's Head ; as she herself had received great benefit from it , and her Friend 's Nerves might probably want rousing likwise . -- Notwithstanding all these Things , she is delightfully pleasant , and her Mind being so cultivated makes her Conversation at all Times interesting . -- Her Spirits are surprizingly good . -- Mrs- Dickenson sent to Miſs Grant to day to request that she would make a little pen-wiper to put in the Inkstand which Lady Herries left to her , and this Evening Miſs G sent her Lover with it . and it is one of the neatest little Articles you ever saw -- The young Man was in high feather and his Eyes glitter 'd so , that it did one 's heart good to see him look so happy -- He is coming again in April or May , and on Mrs- D . advising him not to be under the hatches , he said with a very significant smile and nod , “ O no , I have no occasion to be so now ” -- He and his Sister leave Leighton next Wednesday -- Mrs- D . asked him the Reason why they did not drink tea here the other Day , but he said he dared not tell that , but it was no fault of his -- I had been laughing so unmercifully at poor dear A.M . 's pompous & correct pronounciation of hard Eastern Names , which she took Such pains to teach us , that my poor eyes could not see to trace wha- the dear little Bandinel has kindly written down for me , ( as per above ) -- A.M . has been amazin̄ly good all day , & to night lighted her wax candle in her glaſs Lanthorn -- nodded very significantly to Miſs B . & stole away without giving me her usual Kiss , or taking any other particular leave of the room except looking twice into the Coal- sckuttle , as Bandinel had not had an opportunity of telling me of this secret convention , I knew not what to make of it , till she explained it . Though I at first laughed at the writing of Mrs .. Bloſset s Note , or looking over it , since James left me , it gives pain to my feelings for it is very evident either her hand or eyes are failing rapidly -- the whole of the note is an exact counterpart of the specimen I got Miſs B to copy -- I must rack my imagination & inventive powers before Monday Morg- when her meſsenger is to call for an answer -- I dare not send it to her Sister for an explanation of its contents . I wrote all you told me , this morng to Wing , about Whitelock , & had fortunately finished it before Mrs B . messenger arrived , who was going to Wing . I do strongly opine that that couple are most than dull just now -- wch . I think you might perceive from her last note -- My time is arrived , so good night to you both . A'propos it was my joke , ( an elegant word , almost as much so as fun & fun̄y ) -- to make Miſs Bandinel inform Louisa that she blushed at the high colouring of Govenour Le Mesurier s Manne r amiabilities , sense , accomplishments & c. & c. I meant this as a set off for poor A.M . -- as she had not gueſsed our good friend Mr .. R . was a married man . I beg Louisa a Million of pardon I hope she will forgive me .
