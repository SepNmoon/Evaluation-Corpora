Kersley 29 . Septb . 1785 The continual Succeſsion of croſs purposes at this ill-fated place I am afraid will prevent my returning to my dear Mary on Saturday -- The Fire Engine is perpetually out of Order -- what with the water and damp & c & c I can not get a piece of work completed , which has been and continues to be extremely difficult & expensive and I have told the Men that I wont leave them till it is finished -- My Want of Succeſs in this Undertaking is only like every other Attempt that I have made to increase my Property -- I begin to moralize upon the Subject , and think I shall very soon become a Philosopher -- I have made a Resolution -- not to allow this Busineſs to agitate my Spirits and injure my peace of Mind any more -- let it turn out how it may -- there will be this consolation always residing in my breast -- that it was begun upon a proper principle ) -- The true Motive , that induced me to undertake this Colliery , was , the hopes , that if it shd . answer , it might be the cause of producing that Union of which I am so proud , and now I have the happineſs of being your Husband -- I am very anxious for its Succeſs -- that it might administer to your pleasures -- I will no more complain of my want of good fortune -- now I am blest with You -- what more can I wish for -- ? Nothing in which I am solely concerned -- O that you could always be as happy as I wish you to be -- then you woud be the happiest Wife of the happiest Man in the World , who has the honor to boast , that he is Your Faithful and Affectionate John Dickenson Mrs. Dickenson Taxal
