wrote ye . 3 d . recd- ye 4 th Novbr 1779 Thursday Morng 9 oclock Oh my dearest , dearest , dearest , Sister , Friend , my Miranda , It is not now a time for me to tell you yt . yr . last Letter affronted me , yt . is too trivial an expreſsion but to tell you yt . it made a deep impreſsion upon me is telling you ye . truth . Now then my Miranda , do I after having thoroughly examined my heart & Soul , Swear & declare to you here , on my knees , before ye presence of Our Almighty Father , yt . I will eternally , both in this life & in ye . World to come be yr . real , true , sincere , best & staunchest Friend . Such is my disposition my Sister . I never slightly form connections , ( nor have I ever formed any but one & yt . is with you , I mean as to ye . most perfect friendſhip but when I do , I look upon myſelf as bound by ye . most sacred bonds for life . Cld .. I give you a stronger proof of ye . continuance of my friendſhip towards you , than before I had known you had written anything like such a Letter to me , my promising to write you a circumstantial account , of an affair whh .. causes me so much pain & trouble . Since I have now answered ye . most preſsing interesting subject yt . can affect my heart I will now enter upon my narration . You must know then to resume a little higher , yt .. my Mother had been remarkably kind to me during ye . whole of our séjour . Ye Night before last Ye . whole party went to drink Tea , at ye . R—— T——r where Ld . & Ly .. C——n & their 4 S——s were . My B——r E——d had formed a particular intimacy with ye . two middle ones , You must excuse my mentioning these particulars as you will find them of consequence in some parts of my account My B——r E——d had behaved very improperly during ye . whole of his ſtay & I had winked at several parts of his conduct upon his promise of amelioration . I even went so far as to buy out of my own pocket something , for whh .. he wld .. have been scolded for having had not it been known to have been given to him , accordingly as he wished to have it I bought it & gave it to him . Such was my kindneſs to him yt . he not only told me but every body else , not only this Stay but ye . last he made when disgraced , yt I was ye . most good natured Person he ever had known . But to return to my subject , ye next Evening to our Visit being last night & his Birthday Ld . & Ly . C——n & their S——s were invited among other Company . They were sufficient at both Tables at Cards without me , so yt . there remained at each end of ye . Musick Room Myſelf , Lt. Cl .. L——e & Ma L—— , at ye . other end my B——r E——d & ye . 4 other Boys . Ye . little one being sent to bed , there only remained E——d & ye . 3 big ones . Ye cowardice of E——d is inconceivable for knowing yt . those Boys wld . not strike him again or punish him , he treated ym- with ye . greatest insolence , not only striking ym- & pinching ym- but spitting in their faces & calling ym- all manner of names , I beheld all this myſelf from ye . farther end of ye . Room where I was conversing with ye . aforementioned persons . Not long after , I went out of ye . Room into ye . Room where ye . second Pool was going on , I do not suppose I staid there 3 minutes when upon my return miſsing Lt. Col. L—— I asked Ma—— what was become of him , upon which she shewed him to me talking to ye . Boys , & E——d standing in ye . Door way to ye . Room where My Father & Mother were playing . He soon came up to me , & said to me he hoped I wld .. countenance him , in what he had been saying to those Boys , wh . was yt . he hoped they wld .. retalliate and prevent themselves from being insulted in so groſs a manner . I immediately walked up to ym- and told ym- yt . they had my full consent to do what Lt .. Col. L——e advised them to do . I then walked directly into ye . Room in wh . my Father & Mother were playing at Cards , in which I found E——d standing between their Chairs , & I went up to him meaning to desire him in a whisper to come out of ye . Room to ask these young Gentlemens pardon , but he instead of listning to me , like a true designing mean , sneaking Coward , cried out in a loud Voice in order yt . ye . whole Party might side with him , I never shall mind what you say to me , naming me for you are always drawing me into some scrape or other . My Father then immediately turned round & asked me ye cause of this Speech of E——d 's upon which I in whisper , told him he had behaved very improperly , & there it rested until ye . Pool was over , when my F——r told my M——r just what I had told him , she shrugged up her shoulders . As soon as My F——r s back was turned she called me up to her , & asked me with the greatest anger painted in all her features how I came to mention any thing of such sort to my F——r , yt . it was no busineſs of mine , yt . she was sure whatever E——d had done was right yt . it was nothing to her , yt . whatever scrape he came into my B——r F——k & I always led him into . upon wh .. I asked her whether I had been ye . cause of his doing what he was disgraced for , upon wh . she said yt . I was not ye . immediate cause of it but yt . I had led him into it . yt . I always wanted to govern ye . little ones yt . I had not sense enough for it , & in short she ran on in this cruel manner for a vast while , however I flattered myſelf , but I have forgot to say she then said was any body , to go tell my F——r what my B——r & I had done , & what we now did , she was sure he wld .. be as much offended with us , as he was with E——d in short yt . ſhe wld . tell him every thing she shd .. hear yt . I did from yt . moment . I flattered myſelf , she wld .. be in a better humor this mor : but finding her still very angry this Morning & very cool towards me this Evening . I wish to receive from you my Miranda yr . advice my Miranda yr . how to regulate my conduct towards her during this Chryſis of affairs ; as I can not help saying I am deeply affected by ym—— . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu My dearest , dearest dearest , Sister Friend , Miranda you shall have a scrupulous account & examination of my conduct in my next , during ye whole of my séjour at W—— I hope you will not find great reason to disapprove of it . I am after again having reconsidered yr Letter unto all Eternity Yr . sincerely affectionate Brother & best Friend Palemon toujours de même . P.S . pray tell me you believe me on yr . part . I am very thankful to you for yr . Purse I admire very much , & shall esteem ye more as coming from yr . own precious hands . I send you back M. G s. Note I have a great esteem for her pray let me have an answer as soon as poſsible . Again A . A . toujours chére
