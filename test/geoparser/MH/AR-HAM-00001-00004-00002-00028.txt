My dear Sir , There now remains but little to complete your work of friendship & compaſsion , it has indeed been bestowd upon one that I valued more than all other human beings ; & saying this the weight of my obligations is acknowledged . From regard to the memory of my dearest daughter I have endeavord if poſsible to tranquillize my mind respecting Mr. Holman & to banish every rancorous sentiment , I have therefore written to him , & in answer to my letter , I expect him here tomorrow . I can not be wrong in my desire to forgive . Shou 'd he see what I have to propose in the light that I do , he will be much benefitted , & I shall be extremely gratified in being no longer at enmity with my daughter s husband . The result of this meeting shall be communicated to you in my next . Mrs. Mann , in consequence of Mrs. Holman 's request , has proposed to me to come to Bath to deliver into my hands certain papers , & to communicate the sentiments & wishes of a dying friend . Knowing what Mrs. Mann has sufferd from extreme affliction & bodily fatigue & that she is at this time in a critical situation , I cou 'd not take upon myself to expose her to the chance of an untoward event , I have therefore written to her her this day desiring her to defer her visit till it might be safely undertaken , in the meantime she will consult with you upon the arrangement of Mrs. Holman 's affairs ; you can not have a more able aſsistant nor one in whom I have greater confidence ; she is poſseſs 'd of what were Mrs. Holman 's ideas & of mine which are the same . Shou 'd an agreement take place between me & Mr. Holman there will be no contest upon inferior objects . I have no view but his interest , preserving myself at the same time from dupery , but as he is extremely haughty & acts too much through the influence of paſsion , there is no knowing what turn things may take . After this experiment I shall consider myself in all respects acquitted . I have received a dear letter from Lady Frances Harpur , & one no leſs so from the enchanting Ly . Eliza Halliday , they are both still unanswerd . Mr. Robt Greville has notified to me his surprize & concern as well as Lady Mansfield 's that they had receiv 'd no information of my daughter 's illneſs previous to my daughter 's death . I approve of the answer that was given adding that my daughter after having experienced a total neglect for so many years wou 'd have betray 'd an abject mind by attempting to attract the notice of her relations in her last hours . She might excuse them for not giving her their patronge , but I aſsert that so excellent a mind cou 'd never merit contempt With my best regards to Mrs . & Miſs Dickenson I remain My dear Sir Your grateful Humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St . Bath June 18 th . 1810 PS . Pray inform me in your next how to direct to Dr. Whalley to whom I have been very negligent , grief & anxiety having absorbed my whole mind John Dickenson Esqr .
