My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend ; I understand from what I heard last Night , we are not to have , let me say that I am not to have ye . delight ye . happineſs , ye . comfort of yr . company at W—— O Heavens how shall I spend these long Evenings . My B—— is contented , because M- G- goes , but poor me , my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend does not , I can not help returning f t o ye point from whence I set out it is what I have is uppermost in my mind . Excuse me my friend , pardon me my friend , if I tell you , that I feel even by these trifling little separations , that I never shall be able to part with you , yes my ever dearest Friend it will be impoſsible it will be a shock much too ſtrong for either my ſpirits or constitution to support ; do not comment too severely upon this sentence , I never by all that is sacred ever say any thing to you which does not proceed from ye . bottom of my heart . I suppose M. F . is sensible that I have really cause to be angry with her , & therefore she takes all ye . little means that are in her power to aſsuage it , but she is mightily mistaken , I find she really does not know me , for so far from being angry with her I pity her , however , my friend let me tell you that Ingratitude is ye . forrunner , I think it ye worst of all vices , there is a blackneſs , an d inveteracy , & hardneſs in yt .. vice which ſurely one wld .. think never ought to have entered into ye . human breast . However now to return to ye . last beginning of ye . last Chapter long ſentence or rather to explain ye . reason of my resuming M—— F—— as our subject again well then on W—— Evening when you was in our Company , when you was sitting by ye . other party at Cards , L. C. F . as I was returning out of yr . Room after our party had been over , L—— C—— had been upon ye . same Errand , which I had been , which was to see how far yr . party had got in ye . Pool , as we were both returning before I got to ye Door way , she laid hold on my Arm & then told me yt .. her D—— H . had desired her to say that she had been working a ribband watch Chain , that Evening , that she shd .. be very happy if ye . dear P—— of- W—— wld .. accept of it , what cld .. I answer but to be sure I shd .. be very happy of receiving it , accordingly ſhe sent it to me yesterday Morning , now may I , may I , may I , flatter myself that my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend , will if I send it you her as a patron if you she do es not exactly know how to make yt.se . sort of thing s , will put herself to ye . trouble of working me one by my return , with her own beautiful white hands , take not this as a compliment but as ye . real truth , it is what is due to you Plain truth Dear Murray needs no flowers of Speech Alexander Pope , 6th Epistle of 1st Book of Horace , to Mr. Murray [ later Lord Mansfield ] Pope I have heard , My M . remark hundreds & hundreds of times , not only to me but to many People , that they were almost ye . greatest beauties she had ever seen , adding at ye . same time yt .. she never saw any thing so frightful as thoſe of M—— G—— & Mlle- M—— You once made me promise in London my Friend that I wd .. apply to you whenever I wanted a Purse , may I therefore just say yt .. Miſs Fin- is almost worn out . I cld .. not think of wearing her work before I had any from you , may I therefore hope you will trouble yrself upon my account in these two instances . I leave ym .. both to you how you like to make ym .. I only send you ye . chain for ye . sort of thing . I had already sent my answer to M—— F—— before you desired me not to write , it was a mere verbal meſsage of thanks , it wd .. have been prostituting yr . friendship , it would have been putting her upon a par with yrself , it wd .. have been making her a friend , when I have flatter my ſelf that I have one to whom I can unfold ye . most inward receſses of my Soul . yes , my friend , I esteem yr . friendſhip beyond every other earthly poſseſsion , a happineſs , a comfort , an honor wh .. nothing can equal to me in this World . Let us , O my God grant , long continue so . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend may you enjoy all ye . bleſsings , happineſses & comforts of this life , & that hereafter we may meet neve again to part , such is ye first & last Prayer of yr ever sincerely affectionate Palemon . toujours de même . P.S . yr . employing yrself . thus in my absence , will be some little amends to me for y n ot having ye . happineſs of having you with me , especially as it will recall me frequently to yr . mind , not that ever I doubted I shd .. not sometimes occur without need of any such trifle . Encore une fois Adieu , Adieu , Adieu , que je vous aimerez toute ma vie , le Ciel en est temoin , et que vous me serez toujours chére . 2 d . P.S . Yr Meſsenger stays here he will carry you yr . N—— on Sunday Morning as usual , & on Wednesday Morning he will call for an Answer , Pray let it not be a short one , & very kind one , for consider ye . Pennance I shall have undergone . Encore une fois Adieu , Adieu , Adieu toujours chére .
