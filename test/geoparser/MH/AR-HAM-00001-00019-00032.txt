Abbey Febry 5 th 1773 Indeed my Dear Madam I am Coverd with Confusion by receiving a Second Letter beffore I had thankt you for the first : but am Happy Mr Napier has explained to you the real meaning of my Sillence -- be asured there is nothing requisite to remind me of those whose Ideas so often & so agreeably present themselves as yours & Mrs Hamilton s do to my Mind but realy in Mr Napier 's absence I have scarce one Moment at my own Command ; when here , they are all devoted to him & so upon the whole I am but a bad Correspondant but such as I am I presume on yr Indulgence & hope you 'll be content with me & all my failings & Modestly hope you 'll indulge me with two Letters for one ; a Priveledge we Matrons claim from our Unmarried Friends . I 'm Happy Mrs Hamilton is Much recovred & hope you 'll persuade her to make out an Aſsignation at Buxton wt Mr Napier next May which I 'm certain would do her good : & make him Happy thank God Mr Napier & yr young friends are all Well these of yr Acquaintance beg me to asure you & Mrs Hamilton of their constant & affectionate Remembrance of all yr goodneſs to them you need not tell her but realy I 'm jelous the only comfort I have is that my Husband admires you both so much & fills his letters so much about both that I hope his affections are Divided & so that I may come in for my third share were it all Center 'd in one Object : the affair would realy be too Serious . I am glad you think Mr John Hope an agreeable adition to yr Society & that his Spiritts are so much improved : I Envy him for being so agreeably Situated as to enjoy a Society for which I so often wish in Vain . How does poor Miſs Litchfield do ? I fear not likely to enjoy much Health or Happineſs in this World ! if our next accounts of Ld Napier are not better than those received Last Post I fear it will for some time make both his Son & me dilletory Correspondants but if so impute it to that cause & not to any failure in that affectionate Regard with which I shall ever be My Dear Francis Napier , 6th Lord s Most Sinceare Friend & c & c Miss Hamilton my most Affect respects ever attend M A Napier I 'm quite Vext I can get no Franks
