Dear Sir , We are extremely disappointed to hear that you and Mrs. Dickenson have determined to put off your visit to your Friends in London to so distant a period . I had really promised myself great satisfaction in having an opportunity of aſsuring you personally how sensible I am of my obligations to you for your very kind attention to me upon a late occasion . My Son left us a fortnight ago to join his Regiment at Nottingham , his equipment with his Commiſsion have cost me at least £1500 . to which I have to add an Allowance of Two Hundred Pounds a year in addition to his pay , which I hope he will be able to manage so as to make it answer , for further I positively can not aſsist him . I have lately made an exchange of my Living in the North of Ireland for a very moderate one in the best part of Suffolk , by which I am a loser of about £ 300 a year . I propose to reside upon it four or five months in the summer as I have a tolerable House with good accommodations , & we mean to look upon it as a Country retreat which will not only defray all expences attending it , but also my Son s allowance , & the satisfaction of my own mind must stand in balance for my loſs of income . The Living is call 'd Stanton , equally distant from Thetford & St. Edmund , Bury , a very beautiful Country , with excellent roads & a capital neighbourhood . Enclosed is my Bond for the money you have lent me , it has been executed some time , & is attested by a Notary Publick & his Clerk , half a years Interest will be due upon it the 5 th . of April next , which I will pay as you may please to direct me . I am to receive from the Person Ld . Abercorn presents to my Living in Ireland £1500 for my House , which he is by law obliged to give me Security to pay me in Two Years in equal yearly payments this Security I propose to hand over to you in addition to my Bond , which I conceive will be better than any collateral Security I cou 'd give you upon my Estate in Scotland . At all events when you find occasion for your money it must be forthcoming after Six months notice & in the mean time you may rest aſsured that the enclosed Bond alone is security sufficient & indubitable for God forbid that I shoud trifle with in such a matter as this ! My Son is fully acquainted with the transaction & of your conduct in it . You will please to acknowledge the Receipt of the Bond as soon as convenient to you ; I thought it might come to you as safely by Post as in the way you proposed , which I preferr 'd from my impatience to acquit myself . I am very glad to hear so good an account of my little God Daughter , & hope sincerely that you may have encreasing satisfaction in her . You can not well conceive Lady Stormont 's happineſs upon her acquisition of a Daughter , which is indeed a very beautiful Child , & perfectly healthy ; I have the honor of being her God Father also . All little unfriendly ideas that Ld . S_t might have given foundation for some years ago , are now perfectly obliterated . Lady Frances Harpur is beginning to see her Friends a little she is to be with us with Mrs. Graham & Miſs Cathcart in a very private way next Friday evening . The Duke & Dutcheſs of Atholl have been in Town about a fortnight with their whole Family ; they have a House in Hanover Square formerly inhabited by the Imperial Minister . I beg that you will remember me affectionately to Mrs. Dickenson . I am not sure that our not seeing you the next spring is not owing to some of her œconomical suggestions , for this however I confeſs she is not to be ridiculed , nor am I disposed to do it . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be rememberd to you & Mrs. Dickenson . I shall say nothing from my Daughter as I know she means to write immediately herself , I remain with great regard , Dear Sir , Your faithful & Obliged Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street -- 249 February 10 th . 1790 .
