Dear Madam I have but a moment to reply to your Letter ; but I have great satisfaction to be able to inform you that the King is better & has been continuing to amend these two last days : the Physicians pronounce him to be out of danger . I can give you no information with respect to the Queen & Prince≈øses : as the Queens Palace is barred against all visitors of every description . If I delay another moment I lose the Post . Believe me Dear Madm Yours most faithfully J. Exeter Fludyer St Feb : 18 th . 1804 London February eighteenth 1804 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Bedfordshire free J. Exeter
