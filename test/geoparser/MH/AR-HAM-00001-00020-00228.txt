71 , Queen Street 28 th - Decr . 1808 My Dear Sister , Every kind wish from all my family is much at the Service of You and Yours . May You neither be frozen , nor frost bitten , but , happily preserved through the Winter to revive in the Spring & c. & c. & c . Now , to busineſs . You must answer me accurately & speedily -- A Friend of mine is preparing a Peerage of Scotland , from the Union to the present Time . He is not satisfied with the information he has been able to collect , relative to the Marriages & Births of your Grandfather Lord Archibald Hamilton s Descendants . I have undertaken to squeeze out of You , what I can , & therefore , do n't be lazy , but gratify my friend . It appears , that Lord Archibald was twice married , Who was his first Wife ? Had they any Children ? His second Wife was a Daughter of James Earl of Abercorn . What Children had he by her ? When were they born , & when did they die ? of what profeſsion were the Sons ? Who did they marry ? What iſsue had they ? Who did his Daughters marry ? What Iſsue had they ? After answering these Queries , if You are in a condescending humour , You may add whatever more You chuse , and , I can aſsure You , my friend will be most grateful for your goodness . He is deaf & dumb ; but , very quick in comprehending what is said to him , and has been instructed so well , as to be able to utter Sounds , like speaking , which I understand tolerably well . Do You know that Lady Emily Murray is to be married , next month , to a rich & very amiable Mr- Drummond . He made his Money in China . I never saw him , but he appears to be universally approved of . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Ever Your faithful Friend & Affecte- Brother Napier
