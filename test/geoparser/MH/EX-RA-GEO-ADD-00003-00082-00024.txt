It is with infinite delight my dearest , dearest , dearest friend I reaſsume my Pen since I can not at least at present converse in person with my ever amiable , ever delightful ever angelick Sister . Think not I entreat of you that because you hear me at times speak in a trifling Manner way and conduct my self in a manner unbecoming me , and pay too much attention to minutiæ that that is always is ye . case , no , my dearest friend can not have conceived I am sure such an opinion of Me as to suppose me capable of always holding such a conduct , I perceive you really feel for me when I shew myself in a trifling light , I know it is greatly beneath my character , and I am sensible of it at Night when I consider over what has paſsed during ye day , yet when I perceive it affects you , it then cuts me much deeper than it di t d before and I see myself in such a despicable light , that I know not how to look up to you . Continue to give me yr . friendly advice , instill into me yr . excellent principles , and inspire me with yr . exalted idea , by this means you will counter f act that nonsense which is ye constant Companion of ye . fire of youth , and prevent ye . misfortunes and accidents which a young man such as I am , is likely to fall into , who from ye honesty of his own intentions is apt too much to trust to a deceitful , designing and artful World . You know not with what avidity I attend , imbibe and adore every word that drops from yr . lips . Every desire thing I can find out which you wish to be rectified about me shall be so , I will now give you my honor in as serious a manner as it ought to be given , that as to those two trifling articles of dreſs which you mentioned to me when we last met , you never more shall see them . I wish you to please you , to do every thing that i s agreable to you , it is ye . sole and principle object of my life . Be not offended if I again desire you to continue yr . good advice to me , shew me where you think I have of late been faulty , incautious , or negligent in my behaviour , dwell upon each particular & endeavour to model me into such perfection as you have yourself . I hope I do not flatter myself when I tell you that I believe the foundations you have to build upon are sound and good , and I will follow , I will be conducted , I will be guided by you throughout ye . whole tenor maze , or Labyrinth of this World , where I suppose I must meet with constant misfortunes & impediments . When last we parted I could not help shedding a tear , ye pain I feel at such little separations must convince you , what my situation wld .. have been had we now been separated for ever ; avaunt detested expreſsion , and unleſs you had had ye generosity to bind yourself by a promise to me not to quit this family until I also quitted it . After yr . departure from W—— I went the next morning into yr . Apartment to see if by chance any little trifling thing had been left behind you , and which I could convey to you , I searched but could find nothing but ye . remains of yr . bouquet , which had been presented to you by yr . Palemon , and which you had wore ye . night you was taken ill . I siezed it and kiſsed it with a fervour beyond expreſsion and th at en as you had wor e n it in yr . bosom , in which is concealed a heart worthy of a Saint , I placed it in mine , hoping that it wld .. confer some particular virtue into me , and by that means render me more worthy of yr . favor . But now to speak seriously my angelick friend & Sister , you know not what I suffer I am more captivated than ever , you tell me you are dreadfully afraid for me if I should attach myself to every woman I like with ye . same impetuosity I have to you , call not that impetuosity , call it constancy , my attachment for you was not hastily formed for you I will confeſs the first thing that attracted me was yr . person , which in my eyes is superior in many points to ye . greatest beauties in England , but when I became acquainted with ye . pure sentiments , ye exalted ideas , and divine sentiments principles of yr . heart , I felt as it were a secret pride at having attached myself to a person , so superior to myſelf in every quality , that ought to distinguish Mankind , except in that cursed thing called rank . The chearfulneſs of yr . disposition , ye . delicacy of yr . Wit , & the sharpneſs of yr . irony , which even I have not escaped , but which has always shewn the most perfect good nature to every body , even to those against whom it has been levelled so that they can not help loving it , that all these qual a i ties as well as ye . refinement of yr . manners and yr . perfect politeneſs have had such an effect upon my soul , that yr . dear image has sunk so deeply into my heart , and that it never never never can be effaced out of it . But if I recollect right I said I think that this was a topic we agreed should never more be mentioned between us . I again aſsent to it tho ' with reluctance . Remember only my friend , that my attachment for you will only cease with my life , avoid hurting too much a heart , which is already but too much wounded , and continue ye balmy comforts of yr . friendship , and tell me as you did in one of yr . former Letters , that yr . friendship unl for me , unleſs I did something unworthy of it , would never cease but with yr . life . Adieu Adieu Adieu ma trės trės ch tr ès cher e Sœur , que je puiſse vous appeller quelque temps ou autre par un nom qui marque notre affinité dans un degré de plus préz que je ne le puis a cette heure .
