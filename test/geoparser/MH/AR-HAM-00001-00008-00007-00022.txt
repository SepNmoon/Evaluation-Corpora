Your Letter , my dearest afforded me inexpressible satisfaction , as I thought , from the Stile , it appear 'd , that your Spirits were better than usual . consequently that you were in better Health -- I imagine you have recd . my 2 d letter wch . I directed to your Brother -- was you not surprised at the Language ? I did it out of a Frolick to amuse you -- I did not my dear inclose the letter , as I imagined you from ye . post-mark & c. he would be aware it was for you -- for I did not doubt you had inform 'd him you expected one from ye . Continent & c & c -- I told you in my last that the Town itself of Aix had little to recommend it to the curiosity of Strangers . during our Stay there however -- I was Spectator to a curious Event -- it was the Reception of a Student of Louvain -- who was recd . wth . ye . highest honours -- upon having gain 'd the Prize in the Schools of Philosophy -- out of 6000 scholars there are 40 examin 'd every year & ye . one who gains ye . Prize is recd . in the City or Town where he was born wth . every demonstration of Joy -- it happen 'd this year that a Native of this Town -- a Wine Merct . Son is the person who has got the Prize -- it is 140 years since a person born at Aix has gain one -- & then it was an Ancestor of this young Man s . Lady D . & I went in ye . Coach . through the principle Streets of the Town , -- wch ( to see the preparations ) which were ornamented with Triumphal Arches some of Evergreens -- decorated with a vast quantity of Flowers , Glaſs , ribbands colour 'd & white Egg shells -- embroider 'd Flags -- with inscriptions in Latin & German -- others of Paintings with Lamps & tin ornaments & c. & c. we drove thro ' 30 Arches -- & on each Side of the Streets thro ' which the Primus paſsed were planted Trees at about 4 feet distance from each other , interspersed with flowering Shrubs & flowers -- about 4 oclock the Bells began the to ring & the Guns were fired , when he came to the City gates of the City on Horseback -- upon a fine white horse / a Crown of Bay upon his hat & his Hair curl 'd & hanging down his Back tied with Ribbons -- he had his Scolars Gown on , & a branch of Laurel in his right hand the Students -- of Louvaine -- Aix la Chappell & c. attended on Horseback & rode two & two -- There were drums Trumpets & two bands of Musick went before the Primus -- who appear 'd to receive his Honors wth . a due propriety of behaviour -- with a great air of modesty -- & yet no mauvaise honte . every Window was fill 'd , & every body bow 'd as he paſs 'd wch . he return 'd -- after the Proceſsion -- he went to the Cathedral where the Te Deum was sung -- & supt at the Hotel de Ville -- at the expence of the Town . For that day he wd . take place of any person of the highest rank -- & every Town he paſses thro makes him a present -- the whole amounting to 200 L . & he may chuse whatever Benifice falls within 7 years in the Town of Louvaine -- The feastings & rejoicings lasted several days -- the day after His public entry we were invited to the Ball he gave at the Jesuits Colledge -- & I had the Honor of dancing with the Primus -- The Streets at Night were Illuminated in a very pretty manner by Festoons of Colour 'd Lamps in the Arches -- & upon every Tree there was a little lamp . -- -- I hope my Dear Clara this long account will not appear tedious -- but answer my intention -- that of affording you some amusement -- wth that view I will relate another little Aix anecdote -- Ld . D . & I walk 'd out one Morng . & aſsended a high Hill near the Town from wch . there is a very Noble Prospec t -- when we had climb 'd about half way we found a Cottage & barn wch . a poor Woman who lives in the cottage and seems entirely unconnected wth- the World -- came out and brought us C and without being ask 'd went & milkd her for us -- whilst we were sitting & waiting for Milk . we saw a poor Young woman , wth . a little Sick Child in her Arms , & two other Children following one wth . Beads & a bottle of holy Water -- ye . other carry two small Candles she went into the Cottage , & came out soon again with ye . Candles lighted -- She thereafter went to the door of the large Barn -- wch . had the appearance of an Old Ruin of a Church -- & made a sign for us to follow her , wch . we did & to our great surprize found a place fill with Straw & Wheat like a Granary wch . we got thro ' with difficulty -- at the End of this -- wth no division from ye . Straw & c but its being Swept back -- was a Chapel -- fill 'd with Crucifixes & wretched Pictures more fit to inspire dread than devotion -- a large Altar & two small ones -- a Pulpit , confeſsional Chair -- on one Side a Sepulchre wth . the Body of Xt Figure of Christ lying down dreſsed in Mourning -- with Mary & two Saints standing behind him all in mourning -- all miserable decorated -- the poor woman & her Children kneel 'd down before this Sepulchre -- after having put up the lighted Candles on each side -- & seem 'd to offer up her devotion prayers with a devotion that was quite affecting -- the tears flow 'd fast down her cheeks -- & she pray 'd in Silence over ye Sick Child she held in her arms -- all this was without the least appearance of superstition or Parade it is impoſsible to describe justly such a Sort of Scene to any one that was not present -- but I aſsure you dear I felt it a most edyfy edifying one -- we gave ye poor unhappy Creature some small Money wch we had in our pocket she seem 'd to receive as a Bleſsing from God -- we left her & went thro the Church & found some remains of Gothick Architecture -- Pillars & c. & in a large open Vault a prodigious large Stone Tomb we did not venture in to satify satisfy our Curiosity any farther -- I have sent to Bruſsells for Your letter from hence but can hear nothing of it -- am surpriz 'd I have not got it -- as all letters was order 'd to be forwarded to us here -- pray my dear write me some long letters & direct to the City of London at Dover -- to be left till call 'd for -- English direction -- Adieu my Dr . S T Litchfield at Northampton Angleterre
