Dear Sr . I have been out on a visit some days , & only returned last night , or I would not so long have suffered your Letter to have remained unanswered . Tomorrow & Tuesday we are particularly engaged , but on Wednesday I shall be happy to shew you every thing worth seeing in this place . On Thursday Mrs. Fisher & myself propose going to spend a week in Town , when we hope for the pleasure of paying our respects to Mrs. Dickenson . I am Dear Sr . Your faithful humble Servant J Fisher Windsor May . 25 . 1788
