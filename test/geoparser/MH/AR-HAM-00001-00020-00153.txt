Wilton Lodge 10 th . July 1800 . My Dear Sister , I arrived here on Tuesday , and this being the first post day , I condescend to tell You that I am well , and comfortably seated in my own Arm Chair , after having been well jumbled croſsing Carter Fell . I picked up my Son William at Newcastle , so that the whole Covey is now collected , and in Addition , my Uncle Patrick Napier is with me . I found Maria entirely free from a Cough , which had been very troublesome to her for some Months Weeks . But , it has pulled her down very much . My sovereign remedy , Aſses Milk , removed the Cough , and , I trust , the warm weather will bring her to look like herself again . Maria and my Daughter Mary , have commissioned me to return you many thanks for your kind remembrance of them . Your Books are deposited in their collections , and form a very smart addition to them . Maria has transferred the Hannah More , I gave her , to her daughter . Our Cousins behaved very well , and very friendly . With the Cathcarts I dined frequently , and should have done the same with the Greville Mansfields , had She been able to see much company . I did dine with them once , and was always admitted when I called in a forenoon . She was looking delicate , and was not well . Perhaps , there might be a reason for it . They left London , some time before I did . Lord & Lady Mansfield were not living in Town . He , at his Regiment , and She , at Ken Wood . She is in a thriving way , but , apprehensive that she may not be able to carry her burden , as long as she ought to do . I hope , she may be fortunate , and produce a Son . Our friend Archibald was made a Churchman , contrary to his own wish . Had his father lived , he probably might have procured some decent provision for him . The Military spirit he exhibits might be very well , if there was any necessity for it . I am not one of those who like to see Parish Priests , besworded , and be-Helmeted . Poor fellow , I am convinced he thought he was acting laudably , when he entered on the drilling of a Troop . The opinion of Bishops , will probably be different . I must now go to my Hay Field , where they are very busy . Present my Love and best wishes and those of my Household , to your Guid Man , your Brat , and my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister , Your Affectionate Friend & Brother Napier Hawick , Tenth July 1800 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House HAWICK Leighton Buzzard Napier .
