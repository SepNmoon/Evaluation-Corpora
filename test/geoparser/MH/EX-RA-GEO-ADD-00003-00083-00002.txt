24 June 1779 as sincerity of all Virtues is what my particular disposition is most delighted with & accounts most indispensabl y e -- I must tell you my friend that my great dread of your future change of sentiments , respecting the friendship you wld . now establish & ye knowledge I have of my own sensibility -- is what occasion 'd me so strongly to point out what in all human probability will happen . I do you the justice to think you now mean all you say -- but do not do not ask me to continue a friendship , if I am hereafter to be treated with contempt & neglect -- pardon me but indeed I can not help thinking that you now fancy you wish for my friendship -- & that in a few Months you will fancy -- no such thing -- You will perhaps think this freedom a presumption -- I am in truth your inferiour -- but I never will have a friendship wth.- a person who wd . not be as happy or even feel as proud of my friendship as I was of theirs -- & let me aſsure you that I expect no emolument from Yours -- Your rank -- Your fortune are no no inducements for me to wish the continuance of it -- on the contrary it is for that very reason I so long hesitated to say I would accept it -- from me you will have no adulation or flattery , & if our friendship is to continue -- I shall behave as a real friend ought -- your happineſs -- your honor will be dear to me as my own & I solemnly promise , & you may depend on it as if sworn , never to betray any confidence you may place in me -- Adieu -- remember -- if you please -- that I never shall require any thing more of you , -- if fate should permit us to be friends through life , than strict sincerity strict sincerity , in the true spirit of which I aſsure you I am your friend
