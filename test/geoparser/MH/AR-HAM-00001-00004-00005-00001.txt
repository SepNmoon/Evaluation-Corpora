Naples 1st . Lady Hamilton to Mrs C Hamilton about 1770 A Letter from Ly Cathcart My Dear Mrs Hamilton has given me the truest concern as it gives us a very poor account of your health , & I as I can not be so well satisfy 'd of that particular from any body as from Mr Hamilton or your self , I can not help writing to beg you will give me some account , of your disorder I remember you once talk 'd of making a visit to Naples , I wish you would , it would do you both good , & I can Aſsure you we live in so English a Stile that you need not fear any of the Italian ceremonys & nonsense with us -- we enter as little as poſsible into their Stupid Aſsemblys -- in the Winter are almost intirely with the English & in the Summer live much to ourselves which is the only way of being at all comfortable in this Country -- with this quiet kind of Life I have quite recovered my health & am now rather fat than lean -- but the Climate fine as it is , is certainly not good for the Spirits for mine were never so bad as since I came here -- our greatest diversion is going upon the Sea where we paſs many hours fishing , we take our dinner & eat it upon a Rock : & try to forget we are within fifty Miles of a great City -- Mr Hamilton will not envy us when I tell him Ld Holland is coming to paſs the next Winter here ; however there is no more five hundred pounds to be got upon Election Matters that is one Comfort if there was I should not be so easy , as these are not agreeable expences -- Hamilton s principal friend here is Count Lascaris the Sardinian Minister -- he is a Sensible Man , Mr Hamilton may remember him in England where he was for some time with his Uncle the Comte de Rubion -- pray how does my little friend Miſs Hamilton do ? I beg my love to her , & likewise to Mr Hamilton & le t me intreat you to let us know exactly how both do , for nobody can be more truly interested in every thing which concerns you than My Dear Mrs Hamilton Yr Most Affecte- Sister & Obliged humble Servant CHamilton Naples July ye 13 th - Hamilton joins in Love To The Honble .
