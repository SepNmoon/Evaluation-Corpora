In a Work intitled a Sketch of the Denominations of the Christian World it says “ The Socinians have appropriated to themselves the appellation of Unitarians ; & by this Name they are now more generally distinguished -- Though to this Appelation they have no exclusive Claim , yet it is somewhat more correctly descriptive of their Religious Tenets than that of Socinians -- since they renounce many of the Opinions of Socinians ” John Evans , A Sketch of the Denominations into which the Christian World is Divided [ ... ] . London : J. Sammells . 3rd edn , p.33 . [ 2nd edn 1796 ; 1st edn as ' A Brief Sketch [ ... ] ' 1795 . ] Monday 6 Sepr . as soon as my letter was dispatched James & I took advantage of a fair Gleam a midst the Showers & set out to ride on the new road that is making to Dulverton about 5 miles from hence -- We had previously sent off a little trunk containing some linnen & c to Exeter to be in readineſs for us on our little excursion & by the post James recd . a Letter to inform him that two of the Paynters were coming here this Evg -- which of course deranges our plan -- but the Linnen is gone -- We were particularly lucky in our ride as we avoided the heavy Showers & only had a very slight one James took shelter in a Stable I had the precaution to take a great Coat & set the Shower at defiance under a hedge -- the road is not yet cut thro & a few places for short distances remain to be levelled -- it paſses thro this beautiful Vale -- We had some Conversation with an Undertaker who told us that he had engaged to level 4 miles at 17/6 per Yard wch . amounts to 1540£ pr Mile & he said that Fencing & Stoning would exceed that proportion -- therefore the Road will cost more than 3000£ per Mile -- We rode thro Dulverton -- Col. Thornton the celebrated Man -- has bought a House & the great Tithes of the Parish that belonged to Mrs. Luxmore -- He is very much disliked here & the Gentn . of the Country have refused to admit him a member of the Stag Hunt -- he consoles himself by giving elegant dinners wh . Champaine & c to people of a Description who will visit him -- I observed on the Gate leading to the House a pair of magnificent Stags Horns -- About a mile from Dulverton is Pixton a Seat of Lord Caernarvon s -- the House is small -- new & situated in the middle of a romantic Park commanding a beautiful View of the Neighbourhood & of two fine oak woods , one on each side of the Vale in which is a very large Hernery -- At this Season the Birds are marauding in different parts of the Kingdom & return here to breed at the usual Season -- Lord Caernarvon is represented to be inconsoleable for the loſs of his Wife who died lately & left 5 or 6 Children -- She was Sister to present Sir -- Ackland -- She was going to Ramsgate & died at an Inn on the road very unexpectedly -- in spite of the Devonr . roads we had a pleasant ride -- About 9 OClock the Sir Thomas Dyke Acland , 10th Baronet arrived , unfortunately they mistook their way & came up & down two of the most celebrated Hills in this Neighborhood , one is called Hang Mans Hill & I believe is nearly perpendicular & in a one Horse Chaise with a restive Horse -- One of the Brothers , the one you saw in Town -- lately broke a blood Veſsel & rode 30 miles after it & in consequence has been ill ever since -- he is now pronounced to have an absceſs on his Lungs -- Since his first Attack he was driving out his Father in a Gig & going at a great rate in their own Grounds . one Wheel hit against a Stump & the old Man being very heavy , overbalanced the Vehicle & over they went & the old Man 's Nose was broken & he was much bruised . the Son afterwards spit blood -- he was advised to try change of Air & as a younger brother was going to Exeter to be ordained he attended him & after the Ordination they came on here -- the oldest was so agitated by his exertions in driving ( the younger not seeing 3 Inches from his Nose ) that he was in a violent perspiration when he came into the house , & persevered in sitting in the Hall on a flag floor as he could not bear the heat of a Room -- He seems to be in a sad way & will be a great Loſs to his family as he is very clever & is the Active Manager in the busineſs -- his Father is Auditor to many Men of large fortune in Cornwall & gets 3000 £ a Year by that part of the busineſs I apprehend this young Man will never partake of Xmas fare -- After breakfast Mr. Paynters advised me to sit in the Library where she followed me & we have had a long Case on family Affairs -- She says She believes my Sister Mrs. P . is married to a Frenchman -- That She has attributed a Continuance of her Father s discountenance entirely to the interference of poor Elizabeth , on whom she has been very severe in her Admi Anim adversions & that of course people abroad naturally gave credit to her aſsertions & many relieved her Neceſsities -- That her Children , except the oldest were totally uneducated & She herself had been many Years a Roman Catholic -- & c Sarah who married a Cornish Gentleman & was some time at Naples saw a great deal of the Mrs. Hay & gave & lent them money -- It is curious & mortifying that so proud a Woman as She was shd . have been guilty of such a meaneſs as to put herself on the footing of a pauper rather than inform her family of her real Situation -- I begged her to inform me of her real situation & I promised to lay it before my Father -- Palombi 's told me Mrs. P . 's Father devoted most of time to reading -- One day Miſs Tickel said to him she wished She /could be turned into a book & then she should have more of his company , he said he should be glad of it provided She became an Almanack & then he shd . throw her aside at the end of the Year -- There are a set a Savages that are employed in making the new Road who are Strangers & earn prodigious Wages & live in an extraordinary eating raw bacon & undreſsed meat & drinking such Quantities of liquor as is scarce credible -- One of these fellows was married here lately by Mrs. T . -- when he came to that part of the Service where the Man promises to take Care of his Wife “ in Sickneſs or in health ” . he said to Mr. Dayvy “ hold I have not agreed to that ” & would not go on till urged by the Fair One -- Afterwards he said -- “ Parson this is a long job , I wish you 'd stop & lets have an end o n't ” -- These Men will earn 12/ 6 day ( the common native laborers get six ) and eat & drink it all -- I see here 4 Vol . of Mr. D . s History of Music -- I pitched upon 2 Vol . of Junius a beautiful Type bound in Vellum , just as these were ordered by Junius wch . Burney bought of a Mr. P . -- I felt surprised for a Moment , but on examination they were printed by Mr Herne in 94 -- The Vignettes to ye Hy of Music are beautiful -- drawn by Beasley & engraved by Cipriani -- Whilst Bartolozzi & I were talking I observed a Hill at a distance covered with Air of prismatic Colors -- the green preponderating -- this paſsed off and was succeeded by another Cloud with more Vivid Colors . we called the young folks but before they arrived it vanished , a Third vapour came but the Colors were not as bright -- The Sun Shone upon the hill & a watery Cloud was paſsing over it -- I once saw a Valley 7 miles long & 1 broad near Taxal filled with prismatic Air & saw every Object colored with all the varied of the Rainbow -- & I was glad to see a similar effect produced by the same Cause & wch can only be seen in hilly Countries -- Wednesday -- The old Lady has not brought any letter & I believe has not made her appearance & as Mrs. P . are going thro Tiverton I will send this by them -- The Wind is come round to the North & the weather is promising there fore we have fixed to go to Exeter tomorrow & be there by 3 OClock to hear the finest Organ in the Kingdom -- Adieu Most Affy Yrs Mr. Paynters J.D .
