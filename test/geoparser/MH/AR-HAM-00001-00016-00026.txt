Dear Miſs Hamilton I should be very Happy If It was in my Power to Accomodate you for the 26 th . But I Believe It quite Impoſsible ; in the first Place ; My Ticket Is for the last Day -- the 29 th . -- as I only wish to Hear the Meſsiah ; -- In the next Place ; I am with Lady Caroline Peachy to go in Lord Exeter s Box ; The two Tickets He gave to us ; compleatly filled His Places ; as I Believe every Manager ; has such a Number to Oblige their Friends -- I believe only 10 ; If I dont go , I may give My Ticket Away -- which will Serve for any Other Place in the Abbey -- but I could not give My Seat ; in Lord Exeter s Box ; to any Friend -- But must Inform Him If I dont go ; so that I am afraid I can not be of the least Use to you ; -- I will come to you Saturday Morning -- If It will suit you ; but I can not see you sooner ; -- & I am afraid It Is not in My Power to fix on any Evening , as I may be engaged the Beginning of the Week ; & I am not sure if I shall not go to Putney for a few Days -- I have not seen Charles , but have Made up your Franks , I will get them directed the first Opportunity -- I am dear Miſs Hamilton Yrs . Most Affecly -- Frances Harpur Wednesday
