The alarm & terror that prevailed , stoped my sickneſs , & threw me into a fever attended by a small degree of delirium , and I was so exhausted & reduced in strength that I was obliged to sit on the floor when we arrived at the inn , and support my miserable head on a Chair , as there was neither bed nor sopha to be met with in the ho use , I believe the Idea of having involved Mrs : Ainsworth and Ann Dorsand in a destruction which appeard inevitable , & the mi se ry and wretchedneſs I kn ew our loſs woud occasion to my friends in England occasioned brought on the extraordinary agitati on of my nerv es and which sitting near 30 hours in wet Cloaths by no means tended to diminish -- I believe there was as little of self in my mind at that time as never will be separated from a human being , for I ne glected to serve those who appeard to be more enfeebled than my-self . during the whole storm -- Tho I can not persuade Mrs : Ainsworth to bel ieve me , I can aſsure you I do not regret having been exposed to the sufferings I have gone thro , it was a scene of gr and sublimity of which my mind had no conception , & tho terror prevaild over eve ry other fe eling , I was still at times sufficiently collect ed to be sensible of the superintending providence of the almighty -- When light appeard in the morning I held myself on the top of the stairs , & watchd the storm , that beautiful line of Pope , where he describe s the Indian who “ sees God in Clouds and hears him in the wind ” Alexander Pope , An Essay on Man , Epistle I . occurrd forcibly to my recollection and insensibly calm 'd my mind & renew 'd my hope of protection -- I will reservd the numberleſs occurrences and adventures we met with , till I have the great pleasure o f again embracing you my dear Sister , and aſsuring you at Leighton how affectionately you are all beloved by me -- I desire you will give floras respectful duty to Miſs Morrison and tell her she flatters herself she w ill be like desdemona , and love her for the dangers she has paſsed in her disastrous voyage , as she finds external charms have no influence on her discerning mind -- I have had a letter from Elizabeth , all my letters have miscarried , & she has not heard from me of 12 Months I find the Neopolitan democrates have far exceeded their grand prototipe and example in france -- Adieu with love my dear sister I remain your affect S D .
