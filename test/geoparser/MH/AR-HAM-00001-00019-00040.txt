21 family Canterbury Apl- 26 th - 1773 Since I got yours My dearest Mary I have been mostly confinded to Bed with my old Bowel complaint & indeed every uneaſineſs I have sends me a visit of that sort , the Hurry at first upon My Father s death & that of one of my greatest friends who died a few hours after him for some time keeped my thoughts employ 'd as I had a good deal to do , as I thought , but finding I really had nothing to do & that every thing was ordered without giving myself any trouble than reflection & a sensibility I have in my nature began to give me distu r bance & was confined really very ill in bed for four days but I hope I am now getting pretty well again as My Phiſician only n ow says he visits me as a friend so hope from that , that he thinks all the bad is over -- You do me but justice My dear Ward when you say that writing to Col or Ld Napier you think the ſame , believe me my regard & friendſhip will ever contin u e the ſame for you , espicially as I flatter myself that you will ever act up to those ſentiments I know you are Miſstriſs off , which if you do every body of your acquaintance must be happy in your friendſhip . You ask much abt Miſs Cathcart s marriage I really do not believe it , as I have not been made acquainted with it , not in most distant manner nor do I believe there is any thing of it at present but as she is a very fine amiable Young Lady I should be more surprised at her not going to be married should a proper match be proposed than to hear of it being settled , the other two Young Ladys grown up dont yeild in my opinion to their eldest Sister as they likeways most amiable young Ladys and as handſome as I would wish them , so conſidering my partiality for my Neices out of the question I 'll turn them out against any family I know of the ſame number for every accomplishment whatsoever . The youngest little Kitty one of the finest children I ever ſay as likeways the youngest Son , the two eldest Gentlemen are in Scotland , My Lord himself I think looks better than he did when he went to Ruſsia & in better spirits , He goes ſome time next Month for Scotland in a publick Character where I hope to meet him & to see you abt . the end of May in paſsing to Buxton where I still hope to get for three weeks nor have I changed my motions in the least from my old deſigns -- I beg you may anſwer me one question , You ſeem to know very little about your Uncle Cathcart s family & I thou ght they seemed to know as little about you or Mrs Hamilton , are there any dryneſs between you or not , or do you not write to them concerning yourself or Mama , I can see a little reaſon for your dryneſs with regard to Mr F. Hamilton & family but that can be nothing to My Lord & Sir William that should make a shyneſs between them & you . I beg an anſwer by return of the post as I dont propose staying but a few days longer at Canterbury whatever you say shall be confined entirely to my own breast nor shall any ever hear of it from me Adieu My dearest Ward Remember me most affctly to Mrs Hamilton & believe me to be with great truth your most Affct Guardian Napier Let me know what is become of Mr Hope & where he is
