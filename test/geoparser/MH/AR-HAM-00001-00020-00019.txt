Edinr- 16 June 1779 I much applaud your wise determination , tho ' I doubt whether you are poſseſsed of a competent share of resolution to go through with your Scheme , & rather incline to beleive you will return to your primitive state & become a second time A Bundle of Nerves . Had it been poſsible for you to have transported yourself here a few days ago , you would have been sufficiently revenged upon me for all my impertinencies . Figure to yourself your saucy humble Servant violently agitated by pleasing f and alternate hopes & fears -- Broken Slumbers -- starting in my Sleep s -- hideous dreams & most intolerable headaches . To be more intelligible , know then , that the Seige is begun & the Trenches opened with proper vigour . whether the Enemy will capitulate or not , I can not yet say , but the last flag of truce brought back a favourable Answer & was productive of a consequential interview . I think I hear you say & pray Sir what is the meaning of all these pretty terms ? The answer is , Miſs I have wrote & waited upon the Aunt of my fair one . As you are my only Confidant , I shall give you a little information , who & what She is -- to proceed -- Her name is Leslie , Granddaughter to the Late Earl of Leven and daughter to General Leslie now serving in America . Her Aunt ( Lady Northesk ) upon reading my Epistle sent for me -- told me she was sensible of the Honor -- approved of me in many respects -- thought our fortunes would be too little to set up house upon -- Our Age , too Young -- She not 18 , I not 22 -- Her father does not choose she should marry 'till about 20 -- two Years is a great while to wait -- Her Grandmother must be consulted -- The Old Woman in the Country -- The young Lady not to be addreſsed upon the Subject yet -- Apropos She thinks very well of me -- a ten years acquaintance -- Her fortune £15000 -- of which the Genl- life rents £10000 -- My present income besides my pay £300 pr- Ann . Interest of of £5000 -- £250 -- total £550 -- too little for a Lord & a Lady . So stands matters at present . She goes to the Country immediately , so that we shall not meet again before Winter . Do n't imagine this is one of my wild flights -- the plan is formed upon the most mature consideration -- & is a profound secret in my family -- my Sisters suspect & joke me , I deny that there is any grounds for such suppositions -- Ly- Northesk is to keep my secret -- should any body presume to addreſs her Neice upon the same subject , I am instantly to be informed & brought upon the field -- I can hardly swallow the Idea of waiting so long -- I hope her father will relent & shorten the time , at least I shall try whether or not I can coax him -- this to be burnt -- Adieu N
