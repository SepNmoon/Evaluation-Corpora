Burlington Street 16 th Oct : 1788 . Dear Sir , I am much obliged to you for yours by yesterday 's post , and trouble you in consequence of a large Box being left at my house yesterday directed for you at Taxal in Derbyshire to know whether it is to be sent by the Carrier down there , or if it is not intended to be left in my Custody & deposited in my back Garratt until you want it . -- If it is to remain with me pray let me know when I can send to Wm . Benn to come & remove it , as at present it remains in my pa≈øsage & is so heavy that if it is to go into the Country I shall send it to the Waggon -- There are no Letters except a Letter from Mrs. Carter as I suppose by the superscription ; -- This I will send to Lady Wake s. I am extremely glad to hear that you like your situation and that you are so much improved in your Shooting . The Children are well , all at School except Henry . I have not heard from Nanny but expect a Letter in a few days -- I never enquire after either of those two Ladies at Windsor & Ramsgate -- I hope that the Air of Hants will continue to improve Louisa -- As I write in a hurry you will have the goodwill to excuse me being so very brief which shall not be when I write again to you in Northamptonshire -- pray my love to Mrs. D . & believe me very truly Yours J. Jackson To John Dickenson Esqr . at -- Iremonger s Esq r . Whearwell near Andover Mr Jackson Octbr 16 th 1788 Mr Jackson 1788
