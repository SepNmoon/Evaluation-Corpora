11 th . Janry 1782 My dear Madam I am cover 'd with such confusion that I know not what to write Mrs Tufnell was fully apprizd of your Intention ; I was in Dover Str yesterday three times on that subject , & twice I calld at yr Appartments . I was to have sent again in the afternoon , but being informd at dinner that the Prince≈øses went to the opera , and as you had taken no notice of an Engagement which I considerd merely conditional ; I concluded ( god knows why or wherefore ) that yr attendance on them prevented it . I am so sensibly hurt that I am present totally unable to apologize in person , nor shall I wonder if I am hereafter forever discarded from yr g ood opinion . sincerely yrs J. Farhill
