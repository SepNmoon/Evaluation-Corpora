with what pleasure do I sit down to answer your charming , kind and comforting letter now lying before me ! few things could have afforded me more satisfaction , than I experienced from the receit of it -- The interest you expreſs for me , my dear Friend and the anxiety , about that dejection of spirits , which was but too apparent when Mr Dickenson was here , are truly gratify ing to me -- I can now relieve your mind from any uneasineſs on my account by aſsuring you that there are no traces left of the bad spirits I had during the Winter -- I am light as air , chearful , nay gay , particularly , since I have brought the Day that is to unite me to all I love most in the world , within a fortnight -- Had you been here , with me , my dear Friend , you would have followed me thro ' the progreſs of my depreſsion , you would have known , as well , nay perhaps better than myself , what were the causes of it , at least those that related to myself -- indeed I know not well what they were -- various , trifling perhaps , but finding a heart & mind very well disposed to receive & nourish them , they united & grew to form a ensemble that affected my peace , and disposition -- many disap pointing circumstances happened to my Friends -- I had much uneasineſs on their account , I found myself two or three times in a situation , in which in the absence of my Father I did not know exactly how to conduct , myself & out of which it was not easy to extricate , myself -- I was felt certainly desolate & alone in the absence of my Family particularly my Sister -- All these circumstan ces united and contributed to that dejection which you complain of -- and yet they were not such as separately could constitute a source of misery -- they were not such as could have satisfied you , enumerated in a letter , nor would it have admitted of an explanation that would have justified me -- How often have I wished for you ! -- How many comfortable , hours might we have spent together ! -- But fate has deemed it otherwise -- we are to be separated , and those long separations check & stop that mutual confidence which in the absence of ones Friend , seeks another Chanel -- The want of this Friend always at hand & to whom I could always open myself , has been the primary cause of my dejection -- for as to writing , it is impoſsible to commit to paper , to chance , & perhaps to other Eyes a million of trifles , which one can not even bear one self to immortalize ( to a certain degree by writing them ) & which are yet of consequence at the minute they occur you are now going to leave Ly Wake and Northamtonshire for a long time I fear -- we shall soon be there -- in little more than a month , I hope to be enjoying that free air & directi n g the disposition of my Flower Garden -- chatti n g arm in arm with my dear Bell -- & telli n g her all that has paſsed since she has been gone -- are there no hopes of you on your return from Warwick Castle & c or as you come up to Town ? which by the by I hope enters into your consideration of future Plans -- London is just now in the height of gaiety -- Balls without end -- I go to two this week -- ones at Lady Melbourne s to night and on Friday at Mrs Tollemashe s -- The Dſs of Devonshire is to give three -- Ly Spencer two -- the Prince -- Ly Faulconberg & c & c -- This is all very well but il y a trop et trop -- I am almost tired of it & long for June and Horton -- this has been the longest Winter I ever remember , tho ' ( excepting the absence of my Family ) not a disagreeable one -- I have not been much in public and have lived as much as I wished with Lady Carlisle whom I admire , look up to & love more and more everyday -- Indeed I think myself particularly fortuna te in havi n g met with her , & known to value her uncomm on worth -- their are very few such in this monde -- such feminine softneſs of manner , a temper so pleacid with so masculine an understanding , so much fortitude & command of herself , united to such & such good principles , forms a character one seldom m eets with -- I am vastly well thank God which will delight you to hear -- I expect my Father & c on the 21 st or 22 d -- what pleasure ! what happineſs ! I am reading German à force & have some delightful Books Mm- de Reventlau has lent me -- she is the danish Ministers Wife , was my play fellow in Denmark & is a very amiable & accomplished Woman -- by the by I had a long conversation the other with General Granville a Man of honor , good sense & truth , about Madm Busche & he tells me that he believes all the reports concerni n g he r & P. F . to be false , at least as to what related to her bad conduct , for that certainly the Prince admired & followed her -- but she behaved as well as poſsible about it , & he thinks her a truly good & amiable woman -- & whose character has been very much injured -- adieu my dear Friend ! I heard of your being well from Ly Dartrey -- may you long long , ever , preserve the Bleſsing of Health , with every other you enjoy and deserve -- God bleſs you ! pray remember me to Lady Wake and very kindly to Mr Dickenson -- Mr Digby is pretty well & desires his best compts to you & Mr D -- send me your next directions May 9 th 1786 Honble .
