Bromley June 11 th 1801 My dear Mrs Dickenson I have taken the opportunity of Mr Grenville 's returning to Leighton of sending you a few lines , to inform you of two very great events , which I trust will give you pleasure as you & Mr d . have ever interested yourselves so kindly on our Accounts , one is that my Sister Katherine is to be married in a few months to Mr Warren whom you have seen , it is entir ely with the consent of My Aunts & Mr & Mrs Kindderley & at present no other of our friends know of it , the disparity of their ages is certainly very great , but he has acted so generous a part ( situated as our affairs are at present as you I believe are well aſsured of ) that he can not expect any fortune with her therefore his motive must be real affection . I hope they will be happy I really think she has very good prospect of being perfectly so , the distance she will be from us is very great and that I believe is her only objection to it , he says she shall never be without one of us with her and if she wishes it he would both of us to live with them but that we should not like nor do I think it would be pleasant to them -- Katherine is just gone to spend a few days with Mrs Kinderley and Mrs Keen and she is then going to Sunning Hill to Mrs Glover and from thence to Mrs Froggatt at Fulmer she would have written to you on this subject herself and had indeed had began a letter but was so much hurryed that she could not go on with it she will very shortly send you a long letter , and will I hope be very communicative -- The other last Tuesday we she was invited to tea alone at my Aunt 's for the expreſs purpose of seeing my Aunt Bell who was seated in great form in the parlor to receive her she was not in the least agitated but talked of indifferent subjects and told she hoped very soon to see us -- we d spent that at the Bishop s , and such an evening as I never desi re to spend again , we all were setting off to take a g d rive in the sociable Mr Horsley & Miſs Bourke his intended Lady on horseback & we had not got out of their own n Park before she was thrown , and carried into the House covered with blood and perfectly loſſ senseless , she did not recover in the least for full 3 quart z of an hour afterwards , she is now quite out of danger , and will I hope be well enough to be married very shortly -- she has cut her head & ne ck , hand and , knee , but has no t broke or dislocated and limbs , and such a scene of confusion I never was in every one in fits & c. pray tell Louisa to be Careful how she figures away on horseback I hope you will excuse this short hasty written letter , when I can catch the Bishop in good humour I will get a frank and write a very long one with one united kind love to yourself Mr D & Louisa Believe me ever My dear Mrs Dickenson Yrs sincerely obled & afftly M J Jackson Dont let Louisa quiz this writing as I do aſſure I can write much better To Mrs Dickenson Leighton house
