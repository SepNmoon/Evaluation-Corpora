Miſs Hamilton August 1786 My Dear Cousin -- In the Letter that Mr : Dickenson was so good as to write to my Father , he mention 'd from you that you thought I was very long of answering a Letter you wrote me from Warwickshire -- Now I am a little angry with you , for supposing me so negligent , instead of concluding that your Letter has miscarried , which was the fact -- I hope you will make me amends for the loſs of it , and for the pretty opinion you have had of me as a Correspondent , by writing me a long Answer to this . My Father begg 'd I wou 'd mention that he had written to Mr : Dickenson to thank him for the Brace of Grouse , in case his Letter shou 'd not have reach 'd him , as he by mistake had it directed to Taxall , Cheshire , instead of Derbyshire -- he inform 'd Mr : Dickenson in that Letter , that we were going to remove to N o : 248 Oxford-Street . I correspond with Miſs Glover , and have the pleasure of telling you , that her health is considerably better this Summer than it used to be -- She said in her last Letter to me that she was quite well , and my Mother ( since that , ) saw Mrs : Glover in Town , who told her that she never knew any Person receive more benefit than Miſs Glover had , from James 's Powders -- her complaint was found to be bilious -- It is a pity she shou 'd ever be indispos 'd , for she is a very clever and most amiable young Woman -- she is one of those whose friendship may be depended upon . Miſs Clarkes were at Sunning Hill for a little while , and were as well as cou 'd be expected , considering the affliction they had sustain 'd in the loſs of Mrs : Jackson -- I do n't know when I have been more shock 'd at the death of a Person whom I was not intimately acquainted with , than I was at her 's -- she was such a loſs to her family , and so pleasing a Woman./ I had a long Letter from my sister a few Days ago -- She and her Children are very well . My Brother ( who you know is at Kensington , ) is very well also -- he and a large Party of his Companions , were here last Friday , to celebrate his Birth-day , which was on Thursday the 17 th : Inst . , but as we always have Music of a Friday , it was kept on that Day -- I aſsure you he does not forget either you or Mr : Dickenson -- you are both great favourites of his . My Father is going to build a House , or rather is building it , at the upper end of Oxford Street looking into Hyde-Park -- the House he has taken for a Year is next Door to the one that is growing -- it is a beautiful Situation . We remove tomorrow./ I am fonder than ever of Music , and have been in Town all this Summer taking Leſsons of it . My Father and Mother beg to be kindly remember 'd to you and Mr : Dickenson , to whom I beg you will present my best Compliments -- and I remain my dear Cousin yours affectionately J : Hamilton .
