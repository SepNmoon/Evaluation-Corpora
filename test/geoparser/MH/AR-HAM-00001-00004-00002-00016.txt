Dear Sir , I have received the favor of yours of the 12 th . Inst . , I am sorry to find that I have been guilty of a very great omiſsion in not having acquainted Mr. Hammersley before I left London that I had desired you to draw upon him for your Interest Money as it became due ; to say the truth , it escaped my memory however that matter is now completely rectified , & by the bye I think Mr. Hammersley 's Compts . to me wou 'd have been more perfect , if he had mention 'd my omiſsion to myself only , for I have also received a letter upon the subject . I have been here near five months , & we all like Stanton extremely well , the Country is very fine , the roads excellent about us , and we have received great civilities from very agreeable & respectable neighbours . Mrs. Hamilton & my Daughter will be in London on the 1 st . of Novr . where they are to stay only a Week & then set out for Bath to paſs the winter , I mean to follow them about the middle of the month . As my plan is to paſs five months every summer at Stanton , as long as it may please God to give me health & spirits to enjoy the Country , I judged that I shou 'd be paying a most enormous price for the pleasure of inhabiting my House in Oxford Street for seven months only , I therefore determined to part with it , if I cou 'd do it quietly & upon satisfactory terms ; & this I have already effected tolerably well , having sold it with all the furniture to Mr. J. Campbell of Pembrokeshire , who married Ld . Carlisle 's Daughter last winter . I have received Nine Thousand Three Hundred Pounds , £3000 go to pay off a mortgage that was upon the House , the Balance £6300 remains to me for which I have got Mr. Campbell 's Bond bearing Interest 5 pr.Ct . & also a mortgage upon the Premises , for I have not received a shilling in hand . When this money comes in , which it must when I call for it , I will give you Six months notice to receive the Thousand Pounds you accommodated me with so very handsomely . Mr. Campbell has also purchased the contiguous House which was Mr. Greville 's & they are now laying together , which when finished will make as noble & complete a Residence as most in London . I am surprised to hear you complain so much of constant rains & bad weather , as we have had in Suffolk a most excellent Harvest & as fine a season afterwards as has been remember 'd for many years ; the unsettled climate of Derbyshire is a great drawback upon that County . I hope you have had no returns of your bilious complaint , tho ' I need not tell you that I shou 'd be happy to see you & Mrs. Dickinson at Bath , yet I can not wish that you shou 'd come there from neceſsity . I believe we have secured a Convenient House in a place called Saville Row contiguous to the New Rooms . I received a letter yesterday from Robert , who informs me his Regt . is to quit their Quarters at Croydon in a few days to go to Windsor , where they are to do Foot duty , a very unusual thing . He says he expects the Regt . will go abroad , but I can have no such idea , unleſs we shou 'd be engaged in a Continental War , which God forbid . Such an event wou 'd be very unfortunate for Robert who has no Constitution or bodily strength to undergo great hardships , nor can I boast much of his discretion . He at first disliked the Dragoon Profeſsion very much , tho ' it was his choice , he seems now to take to it better , & upon reflection wishes to continue in it . Had I not put him into the Army , contrary to my own judgement , I perceived my Friends wou 'd have imputed it to me as a plan of œconomy , & I was I confeſs at a loſs to say what he was fit for , as he was very ignorant , speaking French tolerably & German a little being his whole acquired knowledge . I beg you will remember us all most affectionately to Mrs. Dickinson ; we are very happy that you have both so much satisfaction in your little Girl , my God Daughter . We are here not very conveniently situated for getting Franks . I remain with great regard Dear Sir , Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Servt .
