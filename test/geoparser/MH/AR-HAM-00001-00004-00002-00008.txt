Dear Sir I did myself the pleasure of writing to you on Friday the 25 th . of September , acquainting you that I had received official notice of a vancancy of a Cornetcy in the 10 th . Dragoons ; & that it was expected that I shou 'd immediately make a deposite of the purchase money according to the regulated price ; without which the recommendation of my Son cou 'd not be given in to the Secretary at War , for his Majesty 's approbation . Having many months ago obtain 'd General Pitt 's consent to receive my Son into his Regiment , I find myself now in the most unpleasant situation in not being prepared to do what is neceſsary upon the occasion . This was the purport of my last letter to you , expreſsing my acceptance of your most obligi n g offer to accommodate me with a Thousand Pounds , till it cou 'd be got upon the security of an Heritable Bond upon my Estate in Scotland , which my Agent informs me he expects to receive on the 11 th . of November next . As there has been sufficient time for a return of a letter from Taxal had you been there , I am very uneasy lest it shou 'd have remain 'd there to be given to you on your return from Park gate , where I shou 'd have directed it , had I imagined you cou 'd have remained there so long . You will easily account for my uneasineſs , when I inform you , that I am in daily expectation of receiving a peremptory order to lodge the money . Tho ' your answer to my letter may probably be on its way , yet for fear of a disappointment I thought it advisable to make a second application , directing it to be forwarded in case of your absence from home . I remain with great regard Dear Sir Your faithful & Affecte . Humble Servt Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street 249 October 2 d . 1789 John Dickenson Junr . Esqr . Taxal Park Gate Chapel de la Frith to be forwarded if absent John Dickinson esq Chester Derbyshire . Sat . Frederick Hamilton to Mr Dickenson . Oct . 1789 . from Oxford St .
