Taxal August 13 th : 1769 I thought I cou 'd have obey 'd every Command of Miſs Hamilton 's with Pleasure ; but I have of late years wrote so little , that I find myself quite at a loſs whenever I attempt it , & in the retired situation I now am , 't is impoſsible to find Subjects the least entertaining for a Letter to a young Lady : but you was so obliging to desire it , & I know you will excuse my stupidity . I had a tollerable good Journey home , where I arrived safe on Wednesday , about 6 in the Evening , & had the pleasure of finding all my Family well . We were look 'd upon as prodigious great Strangers , & my Husband had entertain 'd some hopes , that he shou 'd be troubled with me no more , as I had staid longer than I at first proposed . We find this Country extreamly cold after leaving Northampton , & especially Sarah ( ‘ Sally ’ ) s warm Rooms , & we have each of us got a severe Cold by the Change . Mr : Lawton often talks of Sally , her little Heart is warm with Gratitude for the kind notice you took of her , & I beg Miſs Hamilton & you , will accept my best Thanks for your Civilities . Our little Habitation commands a sweet Prospect ; we have a Graſs Plott behind the House , from whence you may see a pretty Rivulet , Woods , Cottages , Sheep , Cows , & c. & I have been wishing ( to compleat the Scene ) I had you here , with your Camera , I think your Pencil wou 'd be employ 'd in a manner not diſagreeable to you , & I have another little wild Girl , that I know you wou 'd be fond of . I hope you will not grow tired of draw in g , 't is a pretty Amusement , & I am certain you will arrive at Perfection , if you persevere . “ One thing at once the famed Mrs : Hamilton profeſs t 'd , ‘ Was all his Wisdom e'er presumed to do , ‘ And she is still an Artist 't is confeſs 'd ‘ Among the Ladies , that at once does two . ” Source not yet traced . But you attempt an hundred things at a Time , you scorn the beaten Track prescribed to the rest of your Sex , & wou 'd soar to the Skyes at once . Patience my dear De Witt is all you want . “ You By slow degrees the liberal Arts were won , & Hercules grew Strong . ” John Armstrong , ‘ The Art of Preserving Health ’ ( 1744 ) , Bk II , ll.474-5 . You are so young that you may have a knowledge of every useful Science , before the time that most Women know how to read English . It will always give me pleasure to hear of your Improvements , & believe me that no one upon so short an Acquaintance can have a higher esteem for you , than , Madam , Your most obedient & obliged humble Servt : Miſs Hamilton Please to present my Compts : to S Dickenson & Mr To Mrs : Hamilton in Northampton
