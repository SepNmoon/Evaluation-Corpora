May 3 d . 1785 Taxal I was at Moston my dear friend when I wrote to you last which was on the 29 th of last month -- 1 t May Mosley and I went to the parish Church in the Morning and in the afternoon we went to Chester where I attended a Methodist preaching -- I wished exceedingly for the pencil s of Bunbury that I might have given you a sketch of the whole Gr o up -- the p reache r was exalted upon a Tub reared upon an End -- His sanctified affecte d Manner with the curious Phizes of many of the Devotees would have provoked my Risibility had I not been in Company with a thought leſ s imprudent young Man whose Manners I am very anxious to reform -- We were walking thrō the Streets -- and on a Sudden our Ears were regaled with some of the finest Voices I ever heared -- I immediately suspected wt . was the Occasion of the Harmonious Concert and drew the young Libertine to the place his tittering and jok in g upon my Gravity cd . not alter a single Muscle of my Jaw -- for besides the pleasure I recieved from the Voices of the heavens -- I wish 'd to hear wt . the Man intended to say -- and by preserving my Co un tenan ce I thought it wd . give me an excellent opporty of talkg to this unfortunate young Man upon serious Subject s thō I must confeſs that I was ready to die with Laughing inwardly -- as I thought how much you wd . have been div er ted -- After the conclusion of the psalm the Preacher made a long prayer which had very little of the profeſsional Cant and with which I was extremely pleased -- but the Manner of th e delivery was quite in Character -- and might have made a much graver Man laugh -- imagine to yourse lf a Man exalted upon an Hogshead ( of Ale for ougth I Kn e w ) with an handsome countenance -- his black hair flowing in Curls upon his Neck and Shoulders -- with a delicate Lisp exhorting his attentive congregation his Eyelids closed -- and his black Eyes perpetually rolling underneath . thrō the fervency of his devotion and his delicate white hands exalted upon high -- when his prayer was ended -- I took my Leave -- My Companion was the Brother of Mrs. Mosley -- in the early part of of his Life his Father never allowed him to receive the least contradiction -- he has had a very liberal Education , and every encouragement given to him -- but very unfortunately has fallen into a bad set of Acquaintance from whom he can not liberate himself -- he poſseſses a very good Understanding , and No Man has a better Heart -- He often thanks me for the advice that I have given to him -- profeſses and I believe really has a sincere Regard for me -- and always speaks of me in the handsomest Terms -- the fair promises that he makes are soon forgotten , and he relapses into his usual course of Life -- he is in poſseſsion of a good fortu ne tho not yet of Age -- How shocking it is , my dear Mary -- to see a young Man of only twenty years of Age wh o by his Exceſses has totally ruined his Constitution , and brough t upon himself the infirmities of Old Age -- and tho an early Death is inevitable -- yet depending upon the shatt ered remains of a good Constitution -- he is still guilty of every act of inprudence -- how probable it is . that he will leave this world in a very hasty Manner , without one serious thought -- I really like this Man for his many good qualities , and wt . sin ce re pleasure it wd . afford to me to be the means of Reclaiming him -- 2 d . May -- I returned to Taxal , and found poor Eliz very much indisposed my Father and Sister both well and in great Spirits -- 3 d . Your Letters were just put in to my hands of the e nd of April -- I am made extremely happy my dearest Love to hear that you are well -- You may if you please tell Amaria . that I shall not write to her any more as I 'm quite affronted -- I shall with infinite pleasure leave it to you to chuse the furniture that we shall want , as I wish to submit every thing to your prudent Management . and I beg you will not look upon it as a compliment of course from a Lover -- because I have that confidence in yr- prudence and good Sense -- that convinces me that you w ill manage my Affairs much better than I can myself -- & if the house is to be furnished after we are married where am I to have the happineſs of living with my dear Mary -- till our own is ready to receive us -- I am just returned from Buxton where I have been to bathe and drink the Waters -- I have had a Rheumatick Headach for several days -- which is very disagreeable -- but it will go off , after bathing a few times -- Miſs D . desires I will , present her best Love to you and make her Acknowledgmts . to you for your goodneſs in purchasing an aumonier for her -- She and Eliza will be obliged to you to send them hats of some sort -- they dont wish to have 'em so very hoity toity -- they complain of havg none at present that are fit to be seen -- I think it would be very proper if you was to lay in a tolerable stock of eight guin ea Caps and every other Article of female Apparel in the same proportion -- I shd . like it vastly because you know my happineſs depends so much upon Yr- Dreſs -- I will send another Bill : and I must beg your pardon for having given you so much trouble -- Miſs F . and Miſs D are gone to Stockport today and will not return time enough for me to give you an Answer about the bo o t . I believe he wishes the money to be paid into the hands of an old friend of his in London -- if that shd . be his determination , I will desire that person to wait upon you -- if otherwise you shall know time enough h ow what to do with it -- I am very angry with myself for havg made a foolish promise to go by Wels bourne in my way to London -- I wish he was from home -- I shd . indeed be surprised if you cd . leave your friends without that Regret which I know you must feel upon that occasion -- it is a great addition to my Happineſs to know that you are deservg of their Esteem -- and I 'm very sensible that it is the greatest proof of yr- Affection that you can make so great a Sacrifice for yr- faithful John Dickenson -- I shall go into Staffordshire in a few days . My Love & c to every Body . Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street London
