Hampton 8 th Feb : Cariſsima et Stimatiſsima You see how I obey your injunctions au pied de la Lettre ; and write instantly to shew my Submiſsion tho ' I have not a word I can say by which I may shew my wit . Nothing however cou 'd set me a prating so soon , but the fear that the threatened diſsolution may disfranchise my Cover , and oblige You to pay two pence for that which in my Conscience I pronounce not to be worth one farthing . -- The time of our coming to Town seems rather to recede than approach : Several little domestic evils concur to retard it ; the worst of which is that Mrs. Garrick has had an ugly fall , which still confines her , tho ' no ill consequences , I thank God , are apprehended ; indeed she is almost quite recovered . I am sure she wou 'd send her love and a particular State of Your Orange tree if she knew I was writing , but I have not seen her since I received Your letter , nor shall , probably till this is gone , for we are a very fashionable couple , and see very little of each other -- by day at least -- At dinner we meet for good . You can never oblige me more than by giving me an opportunity of seeing Lord Stormont ; I think him infinitely agreeable . It was a Story of his -- faisons des Solecismes -- ( do you remember it ) that suggested to me the lines in the Bas bleu “ twas tiresome to be quite so clever ” Hannah More Bas Bleu , l.79 . & c You have put me upon the rack of impatience to know from whom this fine present comes . How cou 'd you , knowing my irritability say any thing that shou 'd excite my curiosity , and then barbarously refuse to gratify it . We live at this time of the Year , more secluded than any thing you can imagine and I never see the “ human face divine ” John Milton , Paradise Lost III . 44 . except of a Sunday at Church : I am shocked to death , for fear You shou 'd think I mean a miserable pun upon the Parson . Tell my dear Mrs. Carter I give her a dispensation from writing to me , but not from loving me . I grieve for her head Ach I wou 'd she were as exempt from natural as from moral evil : but she must be contented , excellent as she is , to hold her humanity by the common tenure , and to pay the common fines and taxes . -- Besure interrupt no drawings to write to me , but when you have an idle Minute You can never devote it where it will give more pleasure . I cant pretend to say that this is the Agreeable letter , for which I am in arrears to you , but it serves as well as a wittier to tell you that I am faithfully Yours HM
