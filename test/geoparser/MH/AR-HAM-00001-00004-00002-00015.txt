Dear Sir , On Wednesday the 7 th . Inst . immediately after my return from Suffolk I enclosed to you at Taxal a Post Bill for Twenty Five Pounds payable at Meſsrs . Ransom Morland & amp ; Hammersley 's And as Miſs Hamilton has this day receiv 'd a letter from Mrs. Dickenson dated the 12 th . Inst . in which you are so good as to send me your Compts . without any mention whatever of the Bill , I conclude it cou 'd not at that time have come to hand , I have therefore my apprehensions lest my letter may have miscarried or that the Bill has been taken out of it . Mr Greville by my desire directed the letter more distinctly than usual , & I myself saw it given to a very careful Postman whom I have known for some time . I have already sent to Mr Hammersley 's desiring that the proper precautions shou 'd be observed if the Bill shou 'd be offer 'd for Payment . If the Bill shou 'd have come to your hands I beg you will give me immediate notice . As I have a particular dislike to sending Bills in letters , I shall be much obliged to you if hereafter you will please to draw upon Meſsrs . Ransom Morland & amp ; Hammersley regularly as your Interest money shall become due , & I will take care to give them my directions for your punctual payment . The Bill wou 'd have been sent some days sooner had I not been detain 'd at Stanton by the illneſs of my Curate , which threw the whole busineſs of my Parish upon me for about a month . I propose to return there in the first week in June to continue till November & my whole Family is to follow me after I have been there about ten days & got things in order for their reception . I am happy to hear Mrs. Dickenson & my God Daughter are well . I remain with great regard Dear Sir , Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Servt .
