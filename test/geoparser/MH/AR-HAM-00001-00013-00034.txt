Sunday Morning April 23 d . 1786 My dear Mr. Dickenson I hope you were able to make out the scrawl I sent you yesterday , I was so compleatly tired & ill that instead of writing I should have prefer 'd my bed , -- but dear A Maria din 'd with us & she told me she had four & twenty pages allready written to your Cara Sposa I hope you will think that volume large enough , she looks very well , but I do not think she intends paying a visit to Lady W she said yesterday she could not , we beg 'd to know her reason , the answer was it would not be convenient , I have some notion it is on account of Bell who is has not been quite well all the winter , she is better now & her spirits are rather better . Sunning Hill is such a sweet place I wish you could see it , I can not enjoy it as I used to do , there is no spot nor place that does not constantly remind me of the dear improver of it , I can fancy that I see him , that I hear him , as I walk , I miſs him there far more than here , Oh my dear brother it he is such a loſs , you know not what a loſs it is to me . -- I will say no more , for it affects me more now than at the time we lost that best of friends of Father 's . -- I was happy in hearing that your good Father was recover 'd , I will now tell you that we were all very uneasy on his account when you were in Town as my mother was certain he was worse than he wrote you word he was . I hope you feel no more from the ugly strain that you complain 'd so much of when we had you for our guest , I do miſs you a little bit every now & then ; Mr- John Dickenson whom you saw is married & is very much improv 'd in her looks , her husband is an agreeable man , rather graver than you are if any thing too grave ; I hope she will be happy , though without flattery I do not think she will be quite so happy as a certain pair of my acquaintance . You say you will some time or other give me a little advice on a certain subject , their is no ones advice I would sooner take or be more thankful for than your 's & my dearest Miſs Barnard s -- I will look upon it as a particular mark of your esteem & love for me . Adieu I must drop for church , I feel as if their was thunder in the air , rain would be very acceptable every thing is very backward with us . her , told us she £100 at her death Monday Morning I think by my conclusion yesterday you will perceive that I was out of spirits , I was not well , but I am much better to day . We drank tea at Mrs : D .. s in the afternoon , we saw a picture of Mr. Hamilton painted by Lord Archibald Hamilton which Sr Godfrey Kneller has lately made a present of to the Duke of Queensbury , it has been painted ever since the year 92 when my Lord was about 19 years of age , he is dreſs 'd in Armour very handsome , & I think I saw a small resemblance of Mr : Hamilton Mr : H—— has in his poſseſsion a picture of Sir William Cunningham which he has promised to the late Duke of Hamilton for a companion to the other painted by Mr : H—— likewise the colours are still very fine . My Mother has just purchased a pr- of ponies , they are black & very handsome , they are now breaking , she is very happy at the thoughts of driving them this summer , I never saw her look better & she is very well , she desires her affectionate love to her dear Sr. Godfrey & her saucy husband , a gentleman with whom you have a slight acquaintance . You know I suppose that my publication will soon be en train , Miranda undertakes all the trouble for me , it will detain us a little longer in Town than I could wish . There are On thursday I went with a friend to see the stag turn 'd out on Ascot Heath , Mr. Collier was there & a great deal of company ; the King the master of the stag hounds had been very ill & was not able to attend the monday before , he therefore made his Apologies to Lord Hinchinbroke & told him he had been very ill of a fever , I give you joy my lord , a fever is much better than a stroke was the King 's answer , very comforting , I hope you think . -- Pray tell his majesty that Mrs : D—— is dead & has left debts to be paid to the amount of seven hundred pound , she had not a farthing of money about her , & Mrs : Bloodworth buried her at her own expence , this woman has been found out since her death to be a very great hypocrite who during her life time was thought to be very charitable & religious . ye- Queen desires her best compts .. to you & Mrs. Lenton -- When Mrs .. D . 's marriage was mention 'd before the Prince , she said O- . the Queen has many such wives as George he had his failings , but had a good heart at the bottom ; this is one of the reports out of many , I did not see Mrs .. F——t I just left Mrs : F 's a quater of an hour before she came , Mrs : Vernon ask 'd her if she chose to play at cards , she said no I thank you , we have been playing till I am quite tired , she had really been at cards with the P—— the whole evening . -- I will now conclude this dull & tedious scrawl with aſsuring my brother that I am with great truth his ever obliged friend & sister Mrs .. V : My affectionate & kindest love to my dear M .. Glover
