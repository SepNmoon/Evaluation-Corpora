My dearest dearest dearest Friend , Not knowing whether I am to have the happiness of meeting you this Evening , or not , at Windsor , I aſsume my Pen thus early in ye . morning ( for it is now j ust 5 o clock in ye morning ) to aſsure you how inexpreſsible my joy will be , if you inform me that I am to have that pleasure ; But if I am not to be so fortunate , I do in ye . fairest manner declare to you , I shall not have that ease , life , & content , which yr . presence always inspires me with , during our ſhort stay at Windsor . Whereever I am , you need not fear , my ever forgetting you even for a moment , for yr . dear image has so deeply imprinted itſelf in my heart that it will never be effaced out of it . I wish you to listen to a word or two more only , before I conclude my Letter , I wish you would take this toothpickcase , mind what I say now , I do not say accept , as in an exchange for the present you was so good as to send me a week or fortnight ago , and which to my ſhame be it said , I never have as yet even thanked you for it , an & for * the World says wherever any edged instrument is contained in a present made by one friend to another , their friendſhip does not subsist long . For as it is the object of my wishes that our friendſhip which now ſtands upon the firmest grounds should have an everlasting duration , I am desirous that even such a trivial thing as * superstition ſhould not interfere with . I hope this trifling toothpickcase will not alarm yr . delicacy , for as I am writing to my dearest Friend I write solely & truly what are the sentiments of my heart . Adieu my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend , & believe that I shall ever be yr . sincerely l a ffectionate & loving Friend . P.S . I have bid R E carry you this and call soon after for a little ſhort answer which I entreat you to favor me with . Adieu .
