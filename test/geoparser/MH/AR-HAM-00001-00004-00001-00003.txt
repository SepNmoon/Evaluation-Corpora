Dear Miſs Hamilton I have just now receiv 'd your very agreeable letter of the 20 th . of April , which by some accident must have been detain 'd upon the road as by the course of the Post it shoud have come to hand some days sooner . I must sincerely congratulate you upon the event you have communicated to me which on all accounts I think a most fortunate one . I can not sufficiently express what I feel on account of the generous conduct of your excellent & worthy Friends Ld . & Ldy Dartrey . next to that I am highly flatter 'd by this singular testimony of the approbation of your merit , for you may be aſsured that your conduct has been strictly scrutiniz 'd . Your situation will be attended with difficulties and will require the utmost prudence & caution , as you know , all the avenues of a Court are surrounded with flattery and deceit , but still I am confident that the same circumspection and good sense that have recommended you will enable you to steer a steady course & avoid every danger . You will naturally exert every power to acquit yourself faithfully in this important trust ; and tho ' your whole time may not be requir 'd , yet I am sure you will think it no sacrifice to devote it wholly to this single object , & this you will consider as the best return you can make to your generous friends . I am so far from thinking that there cou 'd be any doubt or objection to your acceptance of this offer , that I look upon it as a very great one , and as the earnest of future good fortune in store for you . My sincere good wishes will ever attend you ; nor will you have , I trust , occasion hereafter to remind me of any want of affection & attention as it wou 'd wou 'd be a real reproach to me ; cou 'd I be insensible of your steady attachment . Mrs. Hamilton has desir 'd me to expreſs to you her satisfaction upon this occasion & we both desire that you will present our Compts . to Mrs. Hamilton Mrs. Stratford also desires to be rememberd to you . I change my Quarters in about a fortnight as the term for which I took the House I am now in will then be out . I have got another tolerable one in Glocester Street n o . 12 . where you will direct when you favor me with your next I am My Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affecte . Uncle Frederick Hamilton
