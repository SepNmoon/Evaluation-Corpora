you can not doubt my Dear Miſs Hamilton with how much pleasure ( I may say transport ) I receiv 'd your note this morning . I feel much more , than I can poſsibly expreſs the high Honour of their Majesties commands . but as there must be some allay to our best joy ; the sense of my increas 'd infirmities is mine on this occasion . I have sent your note to Whitehall tho her Grace 's hour of opening her Eyes was not com e as soon as it is I am sure she will speak for herself my impatience will not let me delay a moment acknowledging to you Dear Madam how Sensible I am of their majesties condescension to me & you how much I am yr most oblig 'd and affectionate MDelany 27 th April 1782
