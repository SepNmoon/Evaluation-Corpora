Dear Miſs Hamilton I believe you are sufficiently persuaded that my regard for you did not originate from the circumstance of your flattering situation in the Royal Family ; and tho ' I may now lament your decided resolution of withdrawing yourself from it , which I shou 'd with difficulty have approved , had I even been acquainted with your motives for taking such a step ; yet you will find in me the same steady attachment through every change of situation that may be appointed for you . From my recollection of some particulars in our conversation when you was last in Town , I judge that you had not then taken this resolution . I hope you may never have reason to repent it & that after having made so large a sacrifice you may not be disappointed of the objects that prompted you to it . As you are to be so soon in Town I suspend any further reflections upon this matter till we meet . Apropos tomorrow being the 13 th . I am in your debt £ 25. if you wou 'd have the money before you come to Town let me know how I can send it you Mrs. Hamilton who is highly interested in your happineſs desires to be affectionately rememberd to you . I am Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful Humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton S t . James 's Street Novr . 12 th . 1782 .
