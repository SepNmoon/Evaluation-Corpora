Edinr- 25 th : March 1779 A Caution to Miſses . Young Lady 's having Franks laying by them , ought to enquire whether the Member who directed them has a Seat in this Parliament or not , to save their Correspondents the Expence of double Postage . Jas- Dundas has never had a Seat in the present Parliament . My Dear Madam , From your long silence I was so thoroughly convinced of your nonexistence that I had ordered all my old Blacks to be well brushed up . A Letter by last Nights Post soon convinced me of my Error . I must begi n by begging you may write no more joint Letters as Miſs N . is upon the point of changing her Name , & I go to Hopetoun House this day with the heads of the Contract of Marriage . The Gentleman is a Dr- Hunter , a Clergyman & the person I mentioned to you as talked of for her when I last saw you . His fortune is easy tho ' not affluent , & as my Sister has contracted her acquaintance to so narrow a sphere as that of the Godly , I think he is by far the best match she can expect . He is a worthy , religious , good man , rather enthusiastic a little in his Ideas , but that suits with her temper . I have before regretted to you the Line of Life Mainie pursued and I own I did not expect she would have made so proper a choice . Tho ' he is not exactly the man I could have wished to have had for my Brother in law , yet I am satisfied that She could not have done better . You may beleive we are all in a tolerable bustle upon this occasion . I am glad the Picture pleased . I think I was rather lucky in leaving London so soon after the beginning of my acquaintance with Sir Wm- W . The good man seems to have a tolerable opinion of me at present , God knows how long it might have lasted . Poor Mr Stanhope Well , I really pity you for the loſs you must have sustained by his Absence . That Wit , that Spirit , that inexpreſsible humour of his , was irresistable . I am ready to undergo any punishment you think sufficient to expiate & atone for my Offence . C. Cathcart is in good health . I 'm glad you like him , he was always a favourite of mine , Her Grace of Atholl is at present at Caroline Park . Affable , pleasing , dignified yet condescending , in short a perfect reformation . His Grace expected daily . You are the first who have mentioned the Stormont 's to me since my arrival in this Country . Adieu . God bleſs you and let me hear from you soon . I am this instant obliged to go to Caroline Park ( Sir A. Oughton s ) with the Contract & c Yours sincerely & Affecly- N—— I hope Miſs K. C . will be happy in her matrimonial schemes -- You do n't tell me who it is to .
