Somerset Street June 12 th . 1791 I received your Letter of last March at Bruſsells where it was transmitted to me from Naples . Nothing that falls from your pen My Dear Niece can offend me or any one else for you write from your heart and that fortunately is a good and a tender One . I have always liked what you have written on a certain delicate Subject & you and I think very much alike on that Subject . I shoud be very sorry to go out of England which I propose doing the 1 st . of September without ; without seeing you but I have still so much busineſs to do here & perhaps must go into Wales that I can not say exactly when I shall be at liberty & if I do come to you in August it can only be for a few days I must not think now of fishing or shooting . I shall soon know more of my destiny for I am fighting off from going to Wales if poſsible . My old Friends drew me away so much that poor Emma paſses her time but ill here but she has the good sense to know that it coud not be otherwise & will last but a short time when we shall get back to the very good Society which her excellent conduct has insured her at Naples . There is not a person on Earth she wishes to see so much as yourself nor to whom she thinks herself so much obliged Pray tell Mr. Dickinson how sensible I am of his kindn ess & that if he allows me to come to him & you the manner I am lodged will be perfectly indifferent to me Adieu My Dear Niece if you knew how have been & am still hurry 'd you woud pity me & I am now starved with cold after the hot weather of 3 days Ever yrs . affectly & sincerely Wm . Hamilton Mrs. Dickenson at Taxal Chapel le Frith near Buxton Derbyshire
