Wherwell 23 . Apl . 94 I am happy ma tres chere amie to date my letter to you from this place , I came here to dinner yesterday & recd . that kind of welcome reception which affords you & I so much gratification -- Mr. Iremonger looks vastly well & is very little lame at least much leſs so than I expected -- Mrs . I a little aged Mr. Laſss- I . looking vastly well , his daughter is an uncommon size for her Age & xtremely lusty -- Miſs I is very indifferent , she took an airing in an open carriage lately & caught cold , & is very feverish & looks ill -- I am now writing in her room -- & am desired to present her b e st Compts . to you -- Mr. Lethelier is here as you will see by the Cover & a Mr & Mrs Tighe niece to Mrs . I . -- The Newspapers arrived at Breakfast & have brought us charming tidings from the Duke of York -- I feel exceſsively rejoiced that he has done something so creditable , at least he has the merit of an extraordinary Action in which we lost so few Men & only one Officer -- it will be a very great gratification to the King and a fine stimulant to the luke warm in this country -- I am glad too that the Emperor was present at an Action which succeeded so well -- Martinique too has surrendered & forces are detached against Guadaloupe & St. Lucia -- & our forces are now bombarding Bastia the capital of Corsica -- I hope we shall do well & before the end of the Year sit down quietly in peace -- Another division of Poland is expected -- that is a vill a inous busineſs -- I delivered Mrs. Preston 's meſsage to Mrs . I -- I mean to set out for Windsor tomorrow morng & shall sleep tomorr ow night at Bags hot as I can not rea ch Windsor in one day -- When I get there I shall certainly have the p leasure of receiving a letter from my plaguer & I hope with good Accts . o f you all -- I will write to you fro m thence -- This place looks just as formerly . every body & every thing appear comfortable & happy & as the french say -- peace & plenty is the order of the day poor Dad is not here -- he was so drunken that he was obliged to be dismiſsed -- A Boy that was brought up here now lives wh- Mr. Bower as batman -- by whom the I.s had heard of the s ale of Taxal -- I did not forget but I omitted to bring my Spurs which I felt the want of yesterday & I do n't at this moment recollect any thing that I wish to say to you except that I love you dearly . I am & shall remain pour toujour le même mari tres affectioné et fidele J.D—— Mr. Tighe is going to leave a place about 7 Miles from hence it wd . not suit us & I only mention it as Mrs . I . has just been talking of Mr. T . 's library which contains 7000 Volumes -- he has laid out 5000£ in very few Years in Books & Mrs. T . had a very fine Library from her Grandfather -- they have their Rooms filled with them -- Miſs Irem . says the library was quite a Bugbear to the Country where Nobody reads -- They are going to live near Stourhead where Sir R. Hoare has given them a house -- in his Grounds rent free , as he wishes them to live near him -- this can be no Object to them as they appear to have a good fortune -- but when people dont want friends , Acts of friendship are forced upon & the Neceſsitous may go to the Devil -- I believe most people feel this -- Adieu Love to Louisa
