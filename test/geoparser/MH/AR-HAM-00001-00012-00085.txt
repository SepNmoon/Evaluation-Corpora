My dr Miſs Hamilton -- I have had ye headach so bad these three last Days that I am going to be bled ; I could not therefore think of Walking -- & should be delighted with your Company with that but that I fear I must put it off , as I think I must keep myself totally quiet after it -- as I am apt to suffer a Good deal from it the Day I am bled -- You can not think how great a Mortification it is to me the not seeing you , As I do flatter myself that had you formd the Walking party at an End yet that you would have done me ye favor to have indulg 'd me with your Company , which I aſsure you would have been a very Great deal to me -- for believe me my Dr Miſs Hamilton yr oblig 'd & sincere humble Svt Harriet Finch I shall take ye first Moment & have my Mrs Cook to wait on you Miſs Hamilton
