My Dst I desired William would explain how impoſsible it was for me to write this Morg , I am not very fit for it now , tho I thank God my Dear Angels are fast asleep , they have suffered a great deal this day , & tho Hawkins aſsures me ( & indeed I am convinced of it , ) that every thing is as right as poſsible , yet my Heart bleeds when I see what they actually do & what I know they must suffer before this is over , there never was two such Dear little patient Beings , which still interests one more But do not my Dear figgett about me , I am amazingly well , & my Spirits keep up really amazingly , Pennel Hawkins & Mr , are all kindneſs to me they have been with me to day from three till 9 & do me an infinite deal of good & contribute to amuse the dear Angels where they can be amused , God Bleſs you my Dear I feel to the bottom of my Heart your kindneſs , pray give my Love & D uty to every body . I can not write more , but beg you will tell Dr Ly Mrs. Smelt I will write to her to morrow for the last time , & that I thank her a thousand times for her Letter . -- pray give my sincerest thanks to Charlotte ( with my best Comps ) for his kind wishes to me faithfuly Yr- -- Mr Glover ten o ' Clock Wedy Night 7 th - April -- 1779 MCG Queens House
