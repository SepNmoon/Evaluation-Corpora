38 , S t . James 's Street 28 th - Febry- 1805 My Dear Sister , You have been pleased to call my last a laconic reply . In its being so , I conceive , consisted its principal merit , in as much , as both You & I were saved much trouble . The one in writing , the other in reading . But , it seems You will not be satisfied without my giving a more particular account , of what I do , what I see , and what I think . If that is the case , and I must obey , do n't be shocked when I tell you that I lead a Life of the most regular stupidity . From the time I have breakfasted , I walk for my health , till some Committee leads me to the House , where I remain till it rises , & then go to dinner . I have not seen Young Roscius , nor been at Concert , Opera , or Ball . At Ten at Night , I am always in my Lodgings , & between that hour & Twelve , I am to be found stretched out in my Bed , from which I extract myself about Eight in the Morning . Could the antient Virgin who prepares my sitting Room be persuaded to rise earlier than She does , I should do so too . The Drawing Room grows daily more intolerable . Good breeding is entirely forgotten , & rudeneſs reigns triumphant . The Queen looks old . She was very civil to me , hoped all my family were well , & did not put that teasing Question , Will you never present a Daughter of yours to Me ? The King , was occupied with his Ministers in deep , & secret consultation , and so , could not make his appearance . I am told that he is in perfect health ; but , not having seen him for two Years , till the day I went up with an Addreſs from the House of Lords , I thought he looked thin , and when he walked , bent forward in a manner , I never saw him do before . I understand , that he enjoyed the Fête at Windsor very much . On that subject I can not speak from personal knowledge , as I was not amongst the number of the Invited . Dont suppose , that I felt any mortification on the subject , as I never supposed I could be thought of , never having at any time of my Life been honoured by admiſsion to the Queen s parties . All my great connexions , Atholls , The LadCounteſs of Mansfield & c. & c. were there . By the bye , I have only seen the Counteſs once , & then only for a few minutes , having been engaged when invited to dine with her . The same thing occurred when the Portland Place Mansfield 's wished for me , at which , I presume , they were much disappointed . I have , however , graciously promised them to eat their Mutton on Monday the 11 th . of March . Whether I shall have an appetite , on that day or not , is doubtful , as I expect on it to receive accounts of Wilton Lodge being sold , or rejected , by the Public . You are quite right in saying that I have the best Wife in the World ; but , whether Mr. D . will allow that he has been as fortunate , I should very much doubt . I pray , You may not call on me for a Character , as I shall certainly speak Truth , and then , You know what You have to expect . I beg Louisa may get quit of her Cold , without delay , and that Mr. D . may not break his Neck after the Harriers , not feeling that I am in the humour to write Epistles of Condolence . So , I desire that Miſs may get well , & Mr. Dickenson take care of himself . A Forest near Alloa ! ! ! It may be so . The Clock has struck Eleven . Good Night . Best Love to all .
