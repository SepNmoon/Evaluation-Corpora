I have seen two other houses in Burlington Strt neither of which will answer for You -- One of them being to be lett up on a repairing lease ; the other furnished . I have likewise seen an Excellent house in Albemarle Street . Rent £150 . Adieu . My endeavours have been unsucceſsfull hitherto , but if I should meet with anything likely to suit You , I will make the neceſsary Enquiries . Your Affect . Brother N—— S t .
