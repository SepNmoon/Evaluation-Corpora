71 , Queen Street 12 th . Septr- 1806 My Dear Sister , You certainly ought to have told me , long ago , that You had received the intelligence I sent You about Miſs Skinner ; but , as I perceive something like contrition , for having neglected to do so , in the first line of your Letter of the 8 th Instant , I shall very condescendingly grant You a free pardon for the Offence . Lady N . returns You many thanks for the Poetry you sent her . The lines do credit to Mrs- John Hunter , and say nothing more than what was was true of old Bet Carter . She was a fine old Slut , though bearing not the least resemblance to a Woman . She had more the appearance of a fat Priest of the Church of Rome , than of an English Gentlewoman . Lord Melville ought to have been replaced on the List of Privy Counsellors , the moment his Peers had acquitted him of the Charges brought against him ; and , I have no doubt of the Sovereign having wished it , though his present Advisers seem not to be hasty in acknowledging the injury They have done him . I have not seen Lord Melville since he came to Scotland , being absent from Edinburgh when he was here , and it has not suited my convenience to go so far North as his House at Duneira . It is situated in a part of Scotland , subject to Earthquakes , and as Thunder & Lightning have rather been prevalent this Season , I have not trusted myself where Volcanic Appearances abound . Not that I have been entirely out of the way of Storms . For I had the happineſs of travelling twelve Miles in the Thunder Storm , on that dreadful Saturday , when so much mischief was done both in England & Scotland . Remember , that I am not answerable for Sir J . B. Warren & his Fleet . Yesterday 's post brought me a few lines from my Son , dated off Barbadoes the 12 th . of July , on which day the arrived there , and set sail again . We know , that they have , since that time , been at Newfoundland . Where they may be now , I have not a sufficient portion of the Second Sight to be able to tell You . The Princeſs of Wales is the most injured Woman , in Great Britain . The Prince , it is said , is soon to be in Scotland . A credit from Meſsrs- Coutts has been lodged at one of the public Banks here , for him & the Duke of Clarence . I do not , however , believe that they will penetrate so far North . As to the Cathcarts , I can say little . His Lordship & his Son Frederick only arrived the day before yesterday , and are to dine with me today . If they behave properly , I shall give them an Invitation to a Haunch of Venison , this day Week . Lady Cathcart and the rest of the family are with Admiral Elliot , at Mounteviot , where they will remain till his Lordship has fixed on a place of Residence for them , either in this Town , or in its Neighbourhood . The latter , is what they would prefer ; it will , however , be difficult for them to procure I have such a place as will hold them . I have no doubt of our being very cordial here . As a proof of it , he waited on me the Evening of his arrival , without my having taken any previous steps to induce him to do so . There are no Kings & Queens , or Windsor 's hereabout , and We are as Great as themselves . I wish I could have the satisfaction of seeing You & Yours sitting down to Dinner with them , in this House . I should vastly enjoy such a Meeting , and if Lady Mansfield could be of the party , it would be quite delightful . But , such happineſs , I fear , is not destined for Me . Pray dont tell me of your Husband s shooting . Had he really been a Sportsman , he would , long ago , have bent his steps to the Highlands to shoot . With best Love & kind wishes from all here to all at Leighton House , viz . Mr. D . Yourself , Louisa & my Countrywoman . I ever remain My Dear Sister Your Affecte- Brother Napier Edinburgh , Twelfth September 1806 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
