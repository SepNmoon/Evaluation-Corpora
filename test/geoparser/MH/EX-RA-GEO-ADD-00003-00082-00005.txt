Tuesday Eveg . 1 st June 1779 Forget you ! O Heavens forbid . You must have formed a very bad opinion of him whom you honor with the sacred name of Friend , if you could suppose , I ever should be capable of forgetting her , whom I not only looked upon as my best and dearest friend , but with whom I ſhould have been happy to have paſsed my whole life . As to the paſsion I have conceived for you , I aſsure you it is of the most honorable kind , and I do re aſsure you , that never any thought that could be injurious to yr . reputation ever entered into my mind . My love for you , for I can not give it any other name , is of the purest kind , totally formed upon the knowledge of yr . distinguished merit and excellent heart . But as you say you can not consistently with yr . honor listen to such proposals , I take heaven itself to Witneſs that I will not intentionally do anything which I think will displease you , and therefore I will as seldom as poſsible touch upon a subject which is painful to you on account of yr . strict regard to yr . honor wh : I declare to you is as dear to me on yr . account , as it is to yourself . I thank you ſincerely my dear & amiable friend for yr . kind wishes in my behalf , and I esteem them more from you than I do ſhould from anyone else as I know they ar i o se ou from the most disinterested and pure friendship that ever existed in the bosom of any mortal . May the Almighty pour down his choicest bleſsings on you , and may you continue to live in all manner of prosperity & happineſs , long to enjoy that health which I am afraid you have not had of late to so great a degree as I could wish , this is the dayly Prayer of him whose greatest happineſs it is to sign himself yr . ever affectionate , and attached Friend , as well as I hope he re after future . H——d GP . P.S . According to my promise I have burnt that dear & admirable Letter which has cost me many a tear sighs & tears . -- Adieu .
