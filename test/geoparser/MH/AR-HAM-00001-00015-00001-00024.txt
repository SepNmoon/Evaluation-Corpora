St James 's Octobr : 6 th 1787 My dear Friend ! I have been leading for this Month past an unsettled rambling kind of life , which has prevented me doing anything I ought , or wished to have done -- particularly -- I have not been allowed to write a letter , for chès nous nobody does such a thing , & I am abused whenever I sit down with a pen in my hand , at any time , but lately the House has been full of young Men , who have made it totally impoſsible to settle comfortably to anything -- we have been visiti n g too -- been at the Races -- & c -- Inshort my dear you have been constantly in my mind as well as heart , but I confeſs I have much to reproach myself on the score of writing -- I used you know to be an excellent correspondant , but then the intercour se was kept up briskly on both sides , you liked writi n g , had good Eyes -- & had nothi n g else to do -- now you are married have other occupations , other pursuits , of much greater consequence , and can not have time to write frequently to all those who love & are interested about you , cela est naturel et de raison , auſsi I do not expect it , & think you very good indeed if you kn now & then let me hear from you . I have two of your letters to answer my dear Friend tho ' I can not allow that I am two in your debt . So there is no chance of seeing you at Horton this year no nor any year -- it is decided & I give the thing up -- I shall never ask you , or hope to see you there , again -- as for expecti n g it -- I never did -- if I could help being vexed & almost angry , I should be inclined to think it very ridiculous -- There is more probability of our meeting in London to that idea I will attach myself -- & will indulge myself in that of seei n g your dear little Honble- Mſ . Gunning & enjoyi n g somethi n g of your society , in the spring -- I do not mean to be unreas onable nor do I intend to monopolize you , for I daresay you will come but for a short time & will be devourd -- that I expect , & must submit to get a bit myself , as I can in a scrambli n g way -- I wish your naughty Eyes woul d get well , I do not approve of their continuing weak for such a length of time -- what do you do for them ? pray do not use them too much , even to write to me , for I had rather not hear from you -- tho ' indeed you hav e so perfect a Secretary , that I can not but be perfectly satisfied when with his imitation both of your hand & style -- I believe I should not have discovered the differ ence pray thank him sincerely & return ing the very affece regards he sent me . Since your first letter I have been at Dallington , slept there & c we went to the play at Northamton with them -- I like Louisa vastly , she is very pleasing , gentle & unaffected I do not exclude Ly Cathcart by only mentioni n g her , for tho ' I knew him a little before , he improves much upon further acquaintance -- a very sensible young Man & by far the best bred one of the present age -- but I am quite in love to with the dear Boys , particularly not little , but great Ld C . who is the tallest Boy of 3 & ½ years old that ever was seen , & who was put into Breeches at 13 Months -- he is a prodigy to be sure je n'en reviens pas ! they are now in Dorsetshire at at Wm 's , from whence I fancy they intend returning soon , as they have been now gone some time . that name puts me in mind of poor Admira Digby -- is it poſsible my dear Friend that you should be still ignora nt of her Death which happened near two Months ago -- she suffered cruelly for many hours previous to that event , particularly so , for she had suffered much , for Months -- it was a happy release , for there had been no hopes from the beginni n g almost of her disorder , & nobody certainly could be better prepared for another world , or more properly detached from this , than she was . Ly Lucy I have not seen since Mr Digby 's Death he has been ever since with his relations & does not leave that part of the world , till the end of November when he will come for the Drawingroom -- he h as suffered much in his Health & more in his min d from anxiety & attendance -- I think he will never recover a loſs , that so entirely changes his way of life & all his plans & prospects of Comfort & happineſs -- his little Girl stayed with us till last Wednesday when I brought her with me and sent her back to School . I return again to Horton on Monday for three weeks in the Course of which time Ly Lucy & I are goi n g to make a little excursion to Bell 's & Sir G. Robinson s -- the latter are to have a great musical party at Kelmarsh on the 19 th , Mr Hanbury & other Singers -- I shall like that vastly , for I am not leſs fond of musick than I was . after the Acceſsion , I go to Mara s & then to St Leonards where I have not yet been this year , indeed I have been at Horton since the 8 th of June a few Days excepted when I have come up for Drawingrooms -- in Nov : I return to H . for another fortnight -- I saw Mrs Wilmot before she went into Yorkshire -- she looked very ill -- but I am glad to hear she is recovered & will enjoy herself at her Father s -- I think she returns in November , or before -- I shall see her then certain ly . I wish I could tell you anythi n g pleasant of your Friend Ly Wake , not that I know or believe anythi n g eſsentially blam able in her Conduct -- I am sure she is a very good Girl , as she is a very sensible one , but she is in a very bad style & way & will certainly get into a scrape -- i. e . make a very foolish & bad match -- there is a Miſs Thursby , Mr Armitage Brother , a very vulgar affected young Man , in a bad style & havi n g nothi n g who admires her , rides with her all about the Country ( that indeed she does with every Man at North : ! ) & they say will marry her -- in his absence she ( what the world calls ) encourag es other Men -- she only means to talk & laugh to amuse hers elf but it hurts her tho it is perfectly innocent of any bad intentions -- I wish she had you to give her some advice -- her Friend Sir Ges scampers about in the same violent way -- I have not told you I believe that we are all well at Horton perfectly so -- my rooms here have been new papered painted & c I have more Books , more Bookcases , tables & c inshort am perfectly comfortable & shall delight to have you by me to enjoy & add to my comfort -- adieu my dear Friend -- God bleſs you -- adieu -- Oh ! My dear what would I have given to have been with you at Calwick -- what a delight ! I should have kiſsed every step I trod -- how happy you must have been ! but you could not ever feel what I should have don e poor , dear Miſs C. Sutton ! To Rouſseau Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
