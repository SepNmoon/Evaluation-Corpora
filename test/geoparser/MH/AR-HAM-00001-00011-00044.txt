P. Grove Sepr : 5 th . I have begged to begin this Sheet to you , my dear Friend , to lament over the contents of your most kind Letter ; I can not say how sincerely I am concerned to hear how much you have suffered by the violence of the Storm , which must have hurried you most sadly besides the serious mischief that such an Inundation must have occasion 'd to your Dwelling ; I believe I need not say much , to aſsure you , how very happy I should have been in making you a Visit , I am sure you know , that it would have afforded me a particular pleasure & gratification , to see dear Miſs Hamilton so happy in her own Home , with so amiable and so good a Husband , & so sweet & promising a Child ; & I should very much have liked to see Grandpapa also . I must not indulge myself in telling you all that I wish to do , or should like to have done now I once again begin writing ; ( -- I am such a sad poor Creature upon the subject of Letter writing , even to those whom I love best . ) Lady Wake has , she says a great deal to say , & I will confine myself therefore to this side ; I must however aſsure you , that I never saw her more enjoyable & comfortable than she seems at present ; She walks a great deal , & does not suffer by it , as she has done of late ; indeed Cha . says she has been better most part of this Summer than she has known her for many years ; & I really think that She has been eſsentially relieved , by the discipline she underwent after her accident ; She certainly looks infinitely better : I have had very good accounts from my dr : Husband , who is at Lord Ducie s ; He returns sooner than I expected , & I leave my Dr : Friend in a few Days : how happy should I have been if you could have met me here . Adieu my Dear Mrs : D . with every good wish to Yourself , Mr : D . & dear Louisa , Your 's very Affly PC . I beg my best Comps : to Miſs Dickenson . -- My dear Friend When I read of the tremendous Storm of Hail Thunder & Rain wch . fell in Bedfordshire I little thought it had extended its alarming influence to your Habitation -- tho ' ( as is your usual custom ) you ma y k e the Evil as slight as you can , I am sure it must have sadly hurried your poor nerves , & must have occasioned you innumerable inconveniences -- the expence of repairing the Pipes & c , I hope will not be of the number , but be defrayed by your rich Land-Lady . The disappointment of not visiting you as I once hoped to do this Month is no trifling one I can truly say ; not that entre nous I ever entertained much dependance upon our dear friend from one cause or other , being able to come & had you been able to receive us , much as she would rejoice to see you in your own House , I do not think we could have managed it this Week & the last , it was quite impoſsible , as I had my House quite full of Company . it wd . delight you to see how well she is , especially as to her nerves -- indeed both your old friends have great cause of thankfulneſs for the comfortable State of health we now enjoy . My only material infirmity is increased deafneſs so much that I can seldom hear any thing said to me , beyond the Person sitting next to me . wch . of course makes me appear very stupid , & in fact deprives me of much pleasure in society of my friends . I am sorry your good Father in Law has a return of his spasmodic complaints . I think he will & Miſs Dickn will be happy to spend their Winter in your cheerful Dom e stic Circle -- & then I hope He will enable you to visit London in the Spring , wth . convenience . & comfort . We have seen a good deal lately of the Macdonald 's , & like them much -- they all dined here on Thursday with Mrs Weddell & Miſs Benson , wch . with dr . Ly . Cremorne & Madame de Nagell ( who wth her Sons have spent a Week here ) & Mr. Catton made a d e lightful Party , such as is seldom found in the Country I could not help heartily wishing you my dear friend had been of it . Lady Louisa & Madame de Nagell , both made Enquiries about you & begged to be remembered when I next wrote . The Chief Baron has sold his Place in our neighbourhood -- but they are anxious to procure another in it . the Ladies Montgomerys & Mrs Hunter are in Scotland . our Paper of yesterday mentions an alarming Riot at Nottingham on acct of the rise of Bread ; nor is it to be wonder at , considering the abundant Harvest , must have raise d their reasonable & sanguine expectations of returning plenty . I wish this Example may not spread ; it certainly will , unleſs vigorous measures are taken that Corn should be sold at a proper price . We have the finest Verdure imaginable I am sure you wd- think this place much improved since you was here ( Alas ! how long ago that is ! ) & Mr D . wd give me credit for being a pretty good Farmer . Charlotte is g one to see her friend Mrs. Burgoyne , & afterwards dear Richard & Jane . She left us yesterday & it never ceased raining the whole day -- our Glaſs is very low . Mr Antrobus is still confined , but hopes to get his liberty soon -- indeed tomorrow I hear he is to do duty in his Church ; & is shortly going to the Sea side . Mr Catton charges me to present his kindest compts to yourself & Mr D . his recreation this Vacation has been the study of Italian , in wch . he makes a very rapid Progreſs . We are read a new Book Modern Philosophy -- have you met with it . Madme Genlis has just published another Work , wch I am told has merit . the Title I do not recollect . My friend Ly Lilford is going to marry her Eldest Daughter to Mr. Stopford a clergyman Lord Courtown s Son -- he bear 's a very amiable Character -- but their Income will be narrow . Marianne has heard from dear Nanny Clarke -- she is pleased with her abode at Ramsgate & finds living there much cheaper than at Bromley . I saw her neices not long since . MA joins me in kind Love to you & yours . God Bleſs you my D ear Miſs C. Fanshaw on “ the Rose ” , by Cooper being sent to her by Ly Hesketh , wth a prohibition not to Copy the Lines . W hat wonder if my wandering hand Had dared to disobey , when Hesketh gave a harsh command and Cooper led astray ? Then broke this tempting Gift of thine , By Pen uncopied yet ; But can'st thou Memory confine or Teach me to forget ? More lasting than the touch of art , Her character 's remain , When written by the feeling Heart on Tablets of the brain . Mr Cooper to Miſs Fanshaw upon learning his Verses by heart . in my next Letter -- provided you ansr this soon . remember to give My k i nd Compts & M s to Mr Dickenson & his Daughter God Bleſs my Dr . friend Have you got Lines by Mrs Hunter supposed to be written by a mad Woman ? if you have , send them to me .
