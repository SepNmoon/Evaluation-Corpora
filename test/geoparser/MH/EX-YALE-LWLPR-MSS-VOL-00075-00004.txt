Bulstrode Sunday Morning 10 th . Decbr 1780 My Dear Madam When I had the pleasure of seeing you last in St J Place , you thought it not unlikely that Bulstrode wou 'd be Honour 'd by Royal Visit but I am very sorry to tell you that the Dſs Dr of Portd . is very much indispos 'd with a cold and confin 'd to her Bed and Chamber ; I hope tho her cold oppreſses her very much at present , that by her submitting to a little care , Slops , and warm nursing , they may prove as Efficacious as our good Friend Dr Turton 's advice tho that I esteem excellent ; I shall , you may believe my Dear Miſs Hamilton I shall be an attentive deputy , feeling as I do the consequences of such a Friend . The Dſs of P : has not mention 'd to Ly . Weyth . or Ly Stamfd her not being well , as she hopes her cold will soon grow better she wou 'd not at such a distance , give them the uneasyneſs of knowing she is not quite well . My Dear Madam you will soon perceive why I write all this -- I can not but wish the Honr you mention 'd may not at this time have been intended as that wou 'd leſsen the great mortification of being oblig ed obliged to give a word to the Wise wch may check an Honour and Happineſs so highly Valued by The Dſs Dr of Portland ; I dare not presume to name my own sensibility on the occasion : this is all entre nous , I have not said any thing of it to ye Dſs , she had but an indifferent night and Lyes quiet now ; I hope if her cold mends enoh for her Grace to go to Town as she proposes to have the great satisfaction of seeing you next week in S t . James 's Place -- in every place Dear Miſs Hamilton s most Obliged & most Faithful hum ble Sert MDelany To Miſs Hamilton at The Queens Lodge Windsor 10 th Decbr : 1780 Mrs Delany
