Taxal June 19 th 1785 Dear Mrs Dickenson I am so truly charmed at the delightful priviledge of addreſsing you by the pleasing name of Sister , that I am afraid you will think me very giddy , & inc o herent in my congratulations -- I aſsure you my Dear Madam , I look upon this Event as the most fortunate of my life , as it will be the means of introducing me to a person whose superior merit will be my cheifest ambition to imitate -- My Brother will expect me to be infinitely thankful to him for having given me an opportunity of knowing you , indeed , I am persuaded I shall never have it in my power to repay the obligation , but you may , if you please , tell him I think it an honor to be related to a man , who has had the fortune to engage the affections of the most amiable of her sex . Elizabeth intended to have written to you , had not her ill state of health prevented her . She desires I will present her most affectionate regard and flatters herself you will pardon an Omiſsion which nothing but Indisposition coud have prevail 'd upon her to be guilty of . -- I am Dear Madam with the most sincere Esteem S Dickenson I shoud be much obliged to you to mention to my Brother that I had began of a Letter to him , but a violent haddack has interruped my intentions . The weather is so hot that it is almost insupportable -- I intend to write by Tuesday 's Post . --
