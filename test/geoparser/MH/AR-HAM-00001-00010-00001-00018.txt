Monday in the sweetest manner that I would remember her to you & tell you , she had been enough in your society to want it . I aſsure you the manner was beyond the expreſsion , Miss A M Clarke showed me your Letter & said & did every thing that was obliging during my visit , she looks thinner & has not I fear quite regained her strength -- she told us that the day preceding before Lady Cremorne & the Queen & Princeſs Augusta had made her a visit which she knew of only ten minutes before , Princeſs Elizabeth had desired the K—— to to do this rather than to take an Airing only . I will now tell you how I came to go with the Q—— . I am a Trustee for poor Lady Wake 's Maid for £30 in the South Sea Annuities Mrs. Vesy wanted to be informed of the particulars of this Busineſs & wished to speak to me Lady C desired me to go -- accordingly I took my Papers & informed Lady Wake & Lord that I had appointed Lady C to breakfast with me the next day & to go with me to add the Dividends to the Stock which is now increased to £36 , this has been since done , I never see Mr. Frank Vesey I believe he goes in June therefore write soon if you can & our Servant shall take it . I think as there has been no Court , it would have been an obliging attention had he called on us oftener ; but I shall regret his absence from England the leſs . he is a very estimable & distinguished character & I shall always respect him , I never see CompteCf . the homophonous verb meaning ‘ enumerate ’ , for which the spelling compt was normal at the time . Soderini neither , Mr. Colle said he was much engaged with some Ladies & that he believed he would be sorry to leave England he believed & that he says he might remain here so I imagine it is some entanglement du Coeur , but it is only a conjecture I have heard lately from Italy my dear old Friend is well he desires his respectful Compliments to you thus , Italians have a respectful phrase which we can not translate Oſsequiare & in this the Chevalier expreſses it . I now answer his Letters in such Italian as I can & he desires I will continue to do it to make me perfect , I am He ssays he should have reminded Compte S of writing to you , but he was on a Tour in Puglia . my Letter bears date the 14 April -- Dear Sr. Wm . Hamilton breakfasted with us this morning though she was not very well I delivered your meſsage to her she goes on the 20 th of May I have seen her but seldom compared with what I could have wished but considering the melancholy alteration of poor Mrs. Carter 's , pretty often she is to dine with us before the 20 th - & Mrs. Vesey will I hope meet her in the Evening , Lady Rothes is a most kind friend she interests herself for us & speaks to me quite affectionately -- she advises me strongly to go to the Sea -- not because I am not very well , but because I have been she says much better this year which I impute in great measure to Sea Air & bathing at Ramsgate . I have had scarcely any bilious Symptoms since & hardly anything of that languor & dejection which always attended it . Mrs. C , being in Town is quite a comfort to me , she shows me great kindneſs & attention I most sincerely esteem her & I love her very much -- Lady Wake has also been very attentive to me I think her much improved & agreeable & sensible Miſs Wake is grown very much -- It is pity Miſs Charlotte has so much affectation in his manners . Do I write comfortably now ? I think I have answered yours almost verbatim -- Poor Sr. Wm . is at Chelsea & well in health I go continually to see her when she is in Town -- Mrs. Vesey & Lady Cremorne are indeed her true & invaluable friends just such as she deserved to find all that I could wish they do , We see my dear Friend the goodneſs of God in bestowing friends on Us even when friendship itself is over with us , justly may we say , his Mercy is over all his works & justly may we rely on him , Ld Cremorne says she shall leave London without anxiety for the care of her friend Mrs. Carter you know is gone , Lady Herries told me she found Lady Beaumont better -- Poor Miſs Foote is confined by the Gout I sent this Evening he is better than he has been -- I dare say Taxal has a thousand beauties Mr. Walpole , dear Louisa is among its fairest ornaments I regret I must not see her & Taxal for some time . Remember me to your amiable Partner , Louisa you say are absent I hope they will receive derive both health & pleasure from their intended excursion -- Tell my Brother I wish he had come I am dull without you . -- How agreeable did you make last Summer most affectionately I say Adieu I will send the Needles next time We are to go to S t : Paul 's on the 20 th to see & hear the 7000 Children & I shall then buy them -- but I will not now delay to send you News of the dear Children Miſs Dickenſons -- Wednesday I took advantage of a very cool day yesterday & called on A Clarke but she was out -- I then called on Lady Wake who has been ill -- she is apparently recovered -- but as the attack was of an alarming kind a fit -- I advised her to send for my Aunt Hardy who is her Physician -- . Restrain your wrath my dear Dr. Brocklesby if when I tell you that I walked afterwards to Lambeth to see my good friend Miranda & afterwards to Hanover Square to dinner -- It is the first time I have attempted such a Thing & I would not mention it but to shew you how well I am -- I have been much more tired with walking a mile in the extreme hot weather , but I do not intend to do this again so you need not scold -- I read your letter to Miſs Heberden I knew she would be pleased to hear it she was surprised surprised I had not told you Mrs. Glover was again a Mother -- she asked kindly after Mrs. H & as she is a great advocate for cold bathing for young Children I she desired I would recommend it to you for Louisa , I met Louisa en paſsant -- I begged he would have a Consultation for Mr. Jackſon Fanny sends her Love she has just called to say she will breakfast here on Monday with Mrs. Carter --
