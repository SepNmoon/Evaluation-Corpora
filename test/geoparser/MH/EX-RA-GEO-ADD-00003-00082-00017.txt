According to my promise to my sweetest Friend I resume my Pen this early in ye morning to inform her how much I was alarmed at seeing her & a certain other excellent tho ' governing personage in close converse together in ye . Window yesterday evening . I own I was very much afraid that it was upon that topic which of all others I dread ye . most , for where one really love s , one is always afraid of ye least instance which may be conducive to a happinesss separation . Pardon me if I still continue to harp upon ye same ſtring , it is so deeply sunk into my heart that I should absolutely go distracted did I even think that there was ye . smallest thing that tended to our separation . Relieve me I conjure you in yr . answer , my dearest , dearest dearest Friend , from all my pains . I flatter myself that you do not find yourself ill treated , slighted , or disregarded , if you ſhould ( which God forbid ) bear a little more if ye . load should not be too heavy for ye . sake of yr . unhappy friend who wld .. inevitably not survive it . It is true that my dearest Father loves a joke , and tho ' perhaps his irony may not be of so delicate a nature as my own , yet he never means any harm to the person against whom he employs it , tho it may appear as if he did ; I am sure he never can mean any to you , the bent of all his jokes is to make you laugh to that exceſs which he delights in . My dearest Mother I am sure treats you almost with ye tenderneſs of a Mother , and when she gives you any advice about laughing , or about any thing else , which perhaps tho ' she may put it in rather a ſtrong light , ( which I am sure I do not know that she ever does ) she always means it for yr . prosperity & wellfare in ye World , I know she does , I know she has a real esteem and affection for you . Next you are loved by my Sisters ' Governeſs , indeed I may say Governeſses , for the least , whenever she speaks to me or to any body else of you , always does it with the greatest affection poſsible , you are loved by all my Sisters , there is not a Servant belonging to any one of ye family houses that does not speak well of you , as to yr . humanity kindneſs , & civility to them . And last of all you are beloved by me to such an exceſs of paſsion , that it is beyond ye power of words to expreſs . I would now , ay most willingly , were this ye condition of my being eternally united to you , retire to some unknown place , give up all my future prospects in this World , and all its pageantry , and live in retirement , happineſs , and love with you . Judge then if such are my sentiments , whether I could bear to endure , the least thing that even appeared to carry with it ye smallest prospect of a separation , distraction & death wld .. then be my only lot . I have seen ye greatest and most celebrated Beauties of England , they never have made but a momentary impreſsion on me , but yr . dear image has imprinted itself so deeply in my heart , that nothing but Death , and Death alone can annihilate that as well as as every thing else . But sufficient for that at present , since I with such generosity resigned up my pretensions to that promise , ( allow me to call it generosity for you know not how much it cost me ) have you at least my friend at least I say ye generosity , knowing my sentiments concerning you , and ye situation of my mind , not to be too hasty , whenever you ( which Heaven forbid you ever should ) intend to make use of it consider it well over first , remember oh remember , if you have any tenderneſs for yr . friend , remember my caution , you never will think of making use of that liberty which I gave you by expunging that fatal promise unleſs you wish to see me lie breathleſs and lifeleſs at yr . feet . Think th no t , that I now speak from the warmth of paſsion , I do not , I am composed , & I am determined , determined , ( I repeat as in my last Letter ) yet determined , as ye unalterable decrees of fate . I ſhall for ye future in all my Letters treat you with a brotherly affection , and call you by the endearing names of friend & Sister , and no longer with ye impetuous paſsion of a Lover urging his suit , tho ' my sentiments as to our separation will ever remain ye . same . I shall have young Gray down with me from Town tomorrow I believe , about some other busineſs , I will have ye . Bracelet made up immediately , do you only send me yr a Motto in yr . answer to this to day , I will wait tho ' with impatience till Winter for ye . ring with toujours aimée . I think one of ye motto 's on ye back of ye Bracelet must be “ Remember , Remember , Remember ” , referring to my caution , and to my C sentiments I have declared to you concerning our separation , which the Almighty avert , as I see it will be conducive to many misfortunes . I have now nothing more to say , but to entreat of you to recruit yr . natural , charming and delightful spirits , and to let me see you as gay as you usually was . I know tho ' you sometimes look seriously at me , it is not a look of anger , but a mixture of tenderneſs , affection & friendſhip . Adieu ever dearest , dearest , & most amiable friend , et croyez que je vous suis infiniment plus attaché qu ' a la vie même , et que je serai au grand jamais Votre très affectionné Ami . P.S . Let me know as soon as you hear concerning any part of ye family going to W—— tho ' I can not accompany this Letter , at least my heart does , so keep it fast .
