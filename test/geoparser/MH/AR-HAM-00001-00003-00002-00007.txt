From Miss S. Dickenson Mrs J. Dickenson My Dear Sister As you was so good to express a wish to hear from me , I have taken a folio sheet which I intend to fill with the few observations I have made in our delighful little tour . The day we left Birch was very unfavorable . The rain was almost inceſsant for near two stages , & prevented our seeing some beautiful views with which this mountainous country abounds . we dined at Chorley and paſsed thro the charming village of Walton in our way to Preston . Sir Harry Haughton has a good house near Walton , & a good many Gentlemen of Fortune reside in the neighbourhood . The church appears to be a fine old building situated on the top of a hill at the foot of which , the Ribble winds its way in great beauty . I can say nothing of Preston as we only changed horses there . I believe there is very little trade there in that town & it is remarkable for nothing but par party animosities which are sometimes carried to an extravagant height -- We slept at Garstange & arrived in very good time at Lancaster to take a compleat view of that venerable old Town . Unfortunately for me we went first to see the castle , which is an object that attracts the attention of all inquisitive strangers ; as we enter 'd the Gate of these venerable remains of antiquity we found many of the prisoners in the yard some of the most unfortunate flocked about us ; the formality of the doors being locked the clanking of the chains & the Idea that many of them were to suffer entirely overset my weak spirits ; we went indeed to the top of one of the towers where I believe there is a noble extensive view of the surrounding country but for my part I cou 'd not see , the horrors of the place had so entirely occupied my mind that I thought I shoud have fainted upon the leads . I am sensible all this was very foolish but I coud not at that time get the better of it . The houses in Lancaster are many of them built of a beautiful stone finely variegated but the town is extremely irregular . I was very much pleased with two almshouses one of them founded by Mrs : Ann Dennison for Eight Old Maids -- the other was for 12 widows & widowers . They were extremely neat & simple & seemd well regulated . The Church appears a fine old building , the Steeple is not so antient . -- I was much delighted with a walk along the sea shore which revived , & did me infinite service . When we left Lancaster to croſs over the sands , I exerted all my resolution to brave the danger ; I once felt very much alarmed as the carriage before us seem 'd raised up by the stream ; but as it was too late to retreat I resignd myself to the event , & Thank God we came over without the least danger or even risk -- We are now at Flookburgh where we intend to stay till Saturday -- I went yesterday to see Lord George Cavendish 's House at Holker . The paintings I believe are very valuable , but as I dont understand them , my mentioning those I liked the best wd be very uninteresting to you . -- In the evening I w rode to see Cartmel Church which belonged once to a priory which is now no more , I believe there are no vestages left except an old gate way , which the antiquarians are undecided about -- I like this place extremely , the natives are open hearted , modest simple & unaſsuming in their manner & they greet you with the cordiality of an old friend , & with the respect of a stranger , which is a distinction I never saw so well preserved There is a large Cotton Manufactory establishd in this neighbourhood , which the advocates for trade are highly pleased with , but the thinking part of the inhabitants are of a different opinion . They in general observe that the people were able to maintain themselves before , that , tho ' their gains were trifling in comparison to what they now are , the price of provisi ons were then proportionable , that their children were well educated , their religious princip al le s attended to , and their churches frequented . The unhappy reverse of this is now the case , the works have been the means of bringing many strangers into the country , whose irregular lives will in time corrupt the virtue & the manners of the people , education is now in a great measure neglected , & the wealth which will naturally accompany an extensive trade , will be the means of introducing vice , immorality , & extravagance amongst them . -- I dont know whether you will think these reasons conclusive ; but I must own they have great weight with me . We intend to go to Ulverston to day , & propose seeing the Priory , the seat of Mr Bryddal . it is I believe a fine old building in very good repair . Monday is the fixed on to begin our journey to the lakes . I hope the weather will be favorable as the beauty of the views we are going to see will be determined by that -- I dont suppose we shall be long absent . I have an opportunity of sending this letter to Manchester . or perhaps I might have written still more I am grown so very good . My Father is in remarkable spirits the waters agree extremely with him . I drink a little but I act very cautiously , & never exceed a very small quantity . The marsh which lies very near us , is in some parts as soft & even as a bowling green ; I walked 4 miles on Saturday -- I must also tell you Mrs M—— & myself went in a little car upon the sands on Saturday Friday evening & were very much amused & dilighted -- I have seen an old tower which formally belonged to a Baronet or Knight of the name of Harrington , there is nothing now remaining of it 's antient grandeur , the greatest part of it has been pulled down to build a farm house . I believe I have sent you all the intelligence I coud collect . I wish I coud have met with anything new or interesting . -- I have looked about for sea weed but I find there is none on these sands ; the plants are the same kinds of those about Taxal , I have only seen 2 or 3 that I did not know . The timber in this country ( except a few in Ld George s Park ) is poor & considering owing perhaps to the sea breezes . There is very little fruit in this country but we have fish , particularly Cockles & Salmon in the highest perfection I often wish for you tho ' I believe there are some things you wd not entirely relish . I am impatient to hear from you , be so good to write to me at Birch & tell me all about Elizabeth . I think as little of her as I can help . -- I have been very tolerable since I came here I have been much commended for my improved looks . I hope Please God I shall for the future enjoy a better state of health or perhaps more properly of mind as the one is in me , entirely regulated by the other . Be so good to remember me affectionately to every one & believe me to be in every situation your sister & friend in the most endearing sense .
