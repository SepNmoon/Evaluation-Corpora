Clarges Street Piccadilly Janry . 17 . 1784 Yes my good Friend I receiv 'd your Letter from Albano and you will I fear give me little credit ; both for saying how much I was delighted with its contents , & what satisfaction it gave me again to have accounts from one for whom I retain the most lively esteem -- I could give a thousand reasons why I have not written to you sooner , I will not stop to dwell on those reasons , but proceed to give you that intelligence you require , because I know you too well not to be certain that your wishing to be inform 'd of any thing that relates to me proceeds from ( what must be so agreable to me ) your kind Solicitude for my happineſs . Before I can begin my little narrative , I must tell you how much I was pleased with the last kind letter you sent me by my Uncle Sir William Hamilton with the ingenious Specimens of engraving which I shall prize , because done by your hand -- I must also inform you that my Uncle & I have talked much of you , what he has said to me on this Subject has made me feel happy that I poſseſs the friendship of one who is so valuable a member of Society : & may I add ? poſseſsing Sentiments I so entirely approve Poor Lady Hamilton ! -- Sir William has shewn me letters which he found after her death , addreſsed to himself , which have affected me exceedingly & made me , if poſsible , still more Sensible of her worth . The alteration in my Situation requires some Explanation to an absent friend , if You find my letter too long , remember 't is in compliance with your desire that I enter into a particular detail of what concerns me . I was not educated with a view of living in a Court , and had not , consequently , every advantage which which that brilliant & exposed station required -- I had seen very little of the great World & my Father who had seen much of it had given me no favourable impreſsions . After his death my time & thoughts were wholly devoted to my mother , who 's ill health required every tender attention from an only Child . Some dear friends of mine who 's partiality thought me equal to the important task of Aſsisting in the Government of the Royal Children , and as the Queen was looking out for a third lady to be at the head of that establishment , they spoke of me -- as my family was well known , the Queen soon gain 'd the intelligence she required concerning me -- all this was the work of three or four days & without my knowledge ; it was then proposed to my Mother & me , & my friends urged me warmly to accept the offer . I took no part in the Affair but resolved to do whatever appear 'd Agreable to my Mother , who was prevailed upon to desire me to accept the honor -- in leſs than a week I found myself in a Situation I had never had the most distant Idea of -- I endeavour 'd to fulfil my duty to the best of my Abilities & had the satisfaction of being approved of -- I experienced great goodneſs & attention from her Majesty & distinctions which were not common -- I soon found however that a constant exertion & a life of fatigue I had not been accustom 'd to affected my health , which tho ' naturally good , was by no means equal to -- it required a stronger constitution than I was bleſsed with -- I had not time to poſseſs my own mind , my health & Spirits suffer 'd very much from leading a life of constant restraint , I felt myself unequal to it & regretted my loſs of liberty -- the Situation became irksome & I had few Opportunities of enjoying the Society of many most dear & valuable friends -- for it was totally inconsistent with the place I was in to ask permiſsion to live so much as I wish 'd with those persons whom I loved . I therefore took the resolution to entreat her her Majesty to allow me to retire from Court -- She was graciously pleased to write me a most Affectionate letter and desire that I would not quit her family , & attributed my request to the effect of low Spirits , -- You may imagine that my Affection for the Queen would not suffer me to preſs any thing in Opposition to her wishes & I promised to remain some time longer , I continued near two Years after this , & then again , from those Motives I mention 'd before , & others which it would not be proper for me to mention , I warmly preſsed for leave to retire & as I made a point of it Obtain 'd my wish . In my next , if You desire it I will tell you in what manner I am settled , & every other circumstance which to a friend may be interesting . Adieu let me hear from you very soon & I Promise not to delay answering Your letter -- tell me every thing which relates to Yourself , for believe me , You have not a more Sincere friend . than
