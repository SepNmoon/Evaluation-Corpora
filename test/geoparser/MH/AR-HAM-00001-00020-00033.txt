Tewin Water 27 th : April 1780 My Dear Sister , Do not imagine that your 18 Pens have been unemployed , rather conceive that they are almost wor'n to the stumps writing to such of my Correspondents as vouchsafe to answer my Epistles . Ungrateful Wretch , Naughty Brother & suchlike Courtly Phrases are hardly comprehensible to a Tewin Beau . But to convince you that I am poſseſsed of some good breeding and pay proper attention to the Commands of the Ladies , I ( now ( with the most profound Bow & in obedience to your positive injunctions ) wish you Joy , and give you full power to say as many pretty things in my name to Mrs- Jackson , as in the heighth of your condescension you may think neceſsary . Turn your Eyes to the Top of the Page & you will discover in pretty legible Characters the place where I now reside and where I propose to remain , and from whence you shall receive my opinion fairly upon such questions as you may chuse to ask . The Dowager returns you many thanks for your Stormont information ; but I who have more curiosity desire to know when the 31 st . of April will be forthcoming , that being a Day not to be found in my Almanack , and the names of the Persons fixed upon to represent the K & Q . I have just been puzzling my brains to discover what weighty matters I am to be consulted upon and after mature deliberation have resolved that the little God Cupid has been dealing about his Darts in the neighbourhood of S t . James 's . But who the Adonis can be , is far beyond my dull Genius to discover . Two or 3 personages have however presented themselves to my imagination viz . R——t G——v——le & J——k H——e . Miranda can easily fill up the Blanks . Had your Sylph been a Widower perhaps he might have been added to the number . Your Books have been a prodigious consolation to me , & I consider myself as really obliged to you for them . Adieu . Value my condescension & profit by the Example . I shall expect a packet from you by Saturday Nights Post , which I shall receive on Sunday at Breakfast . Beleive me your Affece . Brother Edwin Stanhope
