August 5 th . 1779 Thursday My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , I am infinitely obliged to you for yr . last kind Note , it calmed my mind , which yr . former had greatly disturbed , yr . calling my friend was sufficient to shew me that you was not really offended with me . Let me never I conjure you , hear you mention again yr . imprudence in accepting , it is now irremediable ; therefore I conjure you never mention it again . As to supposing , that you wld .. reproach me at any time with being ye . cause of yr . future unhappineſs which Heaven avert , supposing I was ever to be so , I am too well acquainted with yr . truly angelick disposition , to suppose you wld .. probably be capable of so doing ; were you or were you not to reproach me , if I supposed my self the Author of the smallest misfortune that can befall you , I should be the most miserable object upon Earth . Adieu There are Letters arrived from my dearest B—— W—— and as I am sure , my sweetest Sister takes a pleasure in every little joy that befalls me , she will be happy to hear that the accounts are exceeding good , I know not as yet ye contents of that , which he has written to his Father . Pardonnez moi si ma Lettre est bien courte , mais c'est que j'aurai bientot le bonheur , de vous aſsurer de mes sentiments en propre personne Adieu Adieu , Adieu trés chere , aimable , et charmante Sœur , et soyez persuadée que vous m'êtes plus chère que la vie même , Je suis vôtre trés affectionné Ami P.S . Nous n'attendons pas nôtre Ami M. de -S—— de si bonheur cette année , sa femme aiant èté fort malade chemin faisant , il a étè obligé de s'arréter , et ne sait pas quand il pourra repartir . I shall now soon have ye . happineſs of seeing you & conversing with you again . Notwithstanding yr . good advice concerning ridicule , ( which I entreat you to continue not only upon that subject , but upon every other where I You think you I want it ) I think we may encroach so far , as to have a laugh at the Quizzs & Babylonians , seulement entre vous et moi cependant . Adieu Adieu , Adieu , once more ever dearest friend , May Heaven shower down its choicest bleſsings , may it at last conduct you to that everlasting and only true felicity which none other can grant , where I hope we shall meet , never to separate . yr . sincerely attached Friend .
