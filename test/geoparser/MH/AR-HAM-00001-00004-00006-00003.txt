H Hamilton and Mrs. Dickenson -- If I were to be punctual and regular in any thing , I should depart I suppose from that family likeneſs , which I am flatterd in thinking subsists between the lady and me -- I can however aſſure ye most faithfully that I do not value myself on that part of the likeneſs ( if such there be ) for I honor regularity œconomy sobriety and chastity in those who poſseſs such virtues , when they dont make an outcry about such matters , which , perhaps were born with them which alltogether makes the longest sentence about chastity that perhaps ever came from my pen -- As to Mr. Dickenson that is clear another affair -- how the goods of this World , pearls and other valuables are disposed of -- Well often have I puzzled my brain to find out if it was poſſibl y e to see others mens property without invading it leſs or more , or as Bayes expreſses “ graſping it with the eye ” and I am clear that confeſſion tho not a rite of the Protestant Church has its inconveniencies and that there is little dependance to be had on human resolutions , so I am resolved I will make none but rash resolutions , that there may be the leſs gravity in forgetting them -- the mention of that rare bird may convince you that I have lately been reading your letter my kind friend Lady de V . and if I never thanked you for it till now , I do now by these presents thank you by wishing I could accept your invitation to Derbyshire , a Shire I have great attachment to -- Pray is little Mrs : D . solitary or does she begin to play with a brother or a Sister ? this by the way , as Wo Mankind is so unreasonable as to wish for additions to their happyneſs , that when they are going out of the World they may have the more to regret -- But I , having such a Woman as you were mentioning should lament first growing old , then going into some place where I might never see her again -- I , who could at any time eat a Woman that pleased me , what a starving life have I led -- Here was lately a West Indian who seldom spoke to his wife , or looked at her , yet she had a most elegant pair of eyes , and a turn of cheek , chin and throat that was eternally saying come eat me -- yet that miserable wretch never sprung from his chair in a transport to seize the dear Villain by the throat and act the loving cannibal . I heartily wished him dead and sent into everlasting redemption -- After all , such is the incertainty of that capricious animal man , that I cant promise if I were marryed to just such another but I might in a few years call her Madam -- a proof of conjugal death -- If you have never seen Marlows Angler , buy it , & fancy that you could give better Derbyshire Views that the editor has -- Louisa or I I am certain could , for my brain is at this minute pencilling small views for you to replace those you should cut out -- there was a delicate , pretty Girl ( a Mr : Gilpin ) at Matlock when I was last there , who took a fancy to a scratch of mine of Middleton Dale , by her , I remember some of the sweet scenery about the wells , the clear gravelly road , the living water of the pebbly river , the hanging clifs adornd with varied Shrubs , miſs Woodhouse s eyes smiling so well a pleasing countenance to which luxuriant brown hair served as a back ground -- I never forget pleasing prospects -- and now do you know that my hair is far more gray than bay , & c but I follow the advice of the Psalmist , if wrinkles encrease set not your heart upon them Psalm 62:10 : “ if riches increase , set not your heart upon them ” . -- such symptoms of departure do not entirely quash my spirits , and truly my reflexions are seldom of the gloomy cast tho ' I allow a little tinge of melancholy to steal upon my leisure when I think upon certain pleasant people who I am not very likely to see on this side of doomsday -- It would require a considerable consumption of Sea coal for all the fireside conversations I have in store should we three meet again Miſs W . , Macbeth 1.1 . -- It is a question with me which of two of us should be the first silent , there must be a sort of conveniant treaty set on foot Shakespeare being umpire , I could divert myself with drawing up Articles but that our conversation may be differr 'd without great detriment to the parties -- pray tell me of Mr. D . , there appeard to me a good deal of Soul in her body , of life in her eyes , and a shrewd intelligence which well directed ( not controuled I think ) would bid fair for making a clever fellow a happy man , what say you . Page 5 th . -- It is a kind of holiday to me to get rid of letters of letters of busyneſs and fly to my quarto paper , so , as I was saying here I am ( in my 58 th Year , whisper it to Mrs : Waddington ) not half so happy as if I had a companion of the right sort , another myself , yet much happyer as Banquo 's Witches expreſs themselves , for because I care little about conveniencies , and delicacies , and what people say or think -- by people , I understand Mob of any rank in life -- but what the Devil ails the man , he talks as if he did not know his own mind -- stay -- I am a great admirer of all that is admirable -- the sweetneſs of flowers makes me religious , the harmonies of Nature in general delight me , but Woman makes me devout , that is such a one as N o . 1 -- N o . 2 -- and so on -- but I want a sympathizer , and men dont know how , besides indeed they are not made for it -- they have rough faces & rough manners , and are millions of times more selfish -- thus I am myself for example , so I want a vis à vis of a different cast of Character smooth & soft that would temper the quirkishneſs of the Man , and teach him how moderation & considerateneſs are better & more estimable than hate & willfulneſs -- I have my own will at present in most things , & so I shall probably from being only old & unmarried , degenerate into a downright old Batchelor , precise , positive , impatient of advice & controle -- The foresight of this probability is not flattering -- one comfort I have among others , I am not yet turned a hoarder -- Wine does not grow old my cellar , nor have I a hidden groat in the world -- my servants tho have been 14 , 8 , six years with me and are not tired . I farm , garden , read , have some pleasant society , that reminds me of what I have enjoyed in times past -- very faintly -- the beautiful & singular prospects these Islands afford , would well fill a large pamphlet , I do not find time for the sauntering stile of drawing I used when in Dovedale , Castleton dale , Matlock & c or -- & c One of the capital amusements your situation at present affords , must be travelling about which implies , search after reasonable pastime , and useful variety -- let me recommend to you , ( not a tour ( for your knowlege must better direct you than mine ) but objects which you are not far distant from , Ilam Mr. D . s in Staffordsh -- Wetton Mill and the fairyes cave not far distant -- Bolton Abbey Castle in Craven -- Hardwick a seat of Mr : Port -- Keddleston -- tho Chatsworths a tiresome piece of old dignity & bad taste -- let me entreat you to get the complete British Angler with plates by Wale -- there is a simplicity and natural Stile which is perfectly in tune with my youthful taste , which I have not yet lost , and pray order one for me to the care of the Duke of Devonsh Lime Street London to whom addreſs any letter you may have the kindneſs to greet me with -- I shall view it in a twofold light , provided it should suit your fancy -- What a Vandal am I , not to have enquired after the little cherry cheekd girl , that has hold of your heart by one of its strongest tyes ? You I dare say think her cherrubic , or Cherryrubic -- perhaps by this time you are contemplating with divided affection her little brother -- I hope you will take occasion to compliment and any thing more you please John Brickwood Esqr . Mercht as wife & Mother if so it is -- I thought that under so watchful & vigilant a hen as used to hatch her she might figure to great advantage -- She had a uncommon face characteristic & nearly handsome , a very pleasing form , then pretty well formed , and a very cunning & intelligent cast of countenance , announcing , what ? do you tell me , I shant paſs for censorious with you , if we are agreed , tell me . We are at this time preparing not to be afraid of the Spaniards -- I wont lead you about our rocks or our fortifications , nor will I ( it is now so trite among my correspondents ) regale you with Oranges , lemons Citrons limes Shadocks , grapes , pomegranates dates , olives , mulberries all in disorder and so most beautifully diversifyd by the negligent skill of Dame Vertue , nor of Anchovies & whales -- I can tell you of these things more knowingly than Mrs : Waddington who never was here -- I wish you would help to marry young Waller to a man you approve -- She is to my eye and to my understanding a valuable piece of Household furniture -- she will die if she hangs too long on the bough . I would marry her to better than a Prince if I could -- now if you dont think this too long a talk let me know it from your own Authority . I am not by any means tired of writing to you , but there is reason in many things -- my letters remind of the two grains of wheat & c no matter if my friends provoke me , I must tell them that were I as tedious as a Prince , I could find it in my heart to bestow it all upon them & continue me in your favor . Adieu M . H : H . when I shall have red your letter more than twice or thrice , I shall have a chance of knowing how to answer it -- It contains qu . which shall be ans . happy years and many , and to Mrs : D . 's gr . gr . gr grand Children -- England -- Louisa . Taxal Chapel le Frith -- Derbyshire
