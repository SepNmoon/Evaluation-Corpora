My Dear Miſs H . This Fog makes me so generous /as you have a Cold & I should grieve to have you increase it by coming out to me/ that I must send this to tell you Princeſs de Dasckaw & c does not come here this Eveng.- I did design not to send you this Intelligence , in hopes of seeing you to day & tomorrow also /for She comes tomorrow Eveng : / but as ye : weather is so bad , I thought it wd : be ungenerous & cd : not ansr : it to my Conscience -- now I have acted so greatly -- I hope if the Fog should disperse & you be able to come out , that I shall have the pleasure of seeing you this Eveng : tho the Princeſs does not come -- & tomorrow because she does -- perhaps you wd : dine here also & meet Capt : Salvyn who Ld : D has asked ; pray do if you can . I hope yr : cold is better I have got one too -- our best Compts : to Mrs.- Hamilton , I fear this Fog affects her Breath -- it does mine in a slight degree -- Adieu Je suis tout à vous PD Friday Morng : To -- Miſs Hamilton James Street Westminster
