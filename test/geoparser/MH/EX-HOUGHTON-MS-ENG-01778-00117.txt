Bristol Novbr . 18 1782 My dearest Madam Your very kind letter has caused me the utmost astonishment . Mo st heartily do I congratulate you on your emancipation . If you found that a Court life and happineſs , were incompatible you have acted nobly in daring to regain your peace of mind of by sacrifices , which to so grateful and good a heart as yours must have been painf ul I represent to myself what a struggle you must have had before you acquired firmneſs enough to form your resolution , or courage enough to declare it . I rejoyce with you that those difficulties are at an end , and that you retire with the esteem and affection of a wise and good Queen ; this last I think w as a bsolutely neceſsary to the ease of a mind so delicate as yours . -- I am not well nor have I time to say many words , but I mad e i t a duty not to let another post go out w ithout bearing you this slight testimony of my regard . -- I hope we shall have man y comfortable meetings . -- I shall be due to d ear Mrs. Garrick about the 8 th . or 10 th . of Next Month ; pray let me hear from you before that night time ; tho ' I shall scarcely , I fear go so soon , as my removal depends on a very aged and infirm Father , whose declining state makes my schemes very undecided . I am much flatter 'd by your early communication of your plan . Do let me know every thing that concerns you , and believe me most faithfully my dearest Madam Yr . ever obliged H More We always stay at Hampton till Feb : but I shall get at peep at you in Town
