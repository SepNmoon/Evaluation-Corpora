50 Mortimer Street , London . June 8 th : 1809 My dear Cousin , I began to be apprehensive , from your long silence , that something was the matter and am very sorry to find that my fears were just . I am lately returned from making a visit of eight weeks to my dear Father , and thought the time was approaching when I should see you in London , when I received your letter saying that you have given up the idea of coming , for this season . I am , however , happy to find that you are recovered , and that Mr : Dickenson and my Cousin Louisa , are well . I am afraid the old Gentleman has been ill , by Mr : Dickenson 's long visit to him . I have the pleasure to say that I left my Father very well : he was very much affected by the death of poor Mr : Greville , and I was glad that it so happened that I was with him at the time . Both Lady Mansfield and Lord Warwick , were very attentive in writing him preparatory letters , during the illneſs of Mr : Greville . -- I wrote to my Father yesterday , and delivered your kind remembrance . I fear he will not quit Bath , tho ' he does not like it : a removal he dreads ( very naturally ) as a serious operation . Were it not for that , I think he would spend the remainder of his life in London , which would be a circumstance at which I should much rejoice . While I was in Herefordshire , about four years ago , I amused myself with translating into English Blank Verse , one of the Tragedies of Count Alfieri ; which I suppose is what Mr : Morgan alludes to . He never heard me read it ; but may have seen the manuscript , in the hands of one or two people to whom I lent it -- Mrs : Peploe , for one , from to whom I was indebted for the reading of Alfieri 's Works in their original language . I have not read Miſs Hamilton 's “ Cottagers of Glenburnie ” , but shall do so , on your recommendation . I think her “ Memoirs of Modern Philosophers ” , very clever . She is , I believe , no relation , though of Scotland . -- I have not heard any thing of Mrs : Garrick : I suppose writing is become troublesome to her , or you would , in all probability , have had tidings of her . -- I was at two Concerts , while I was at Bath , a private one at Miſs Wroughton 's and Mr : Rauzzini 's Benefit , at the Rooms ; at which latter , Mr : Braham and Madame Catalani sung : I need add no praise to that account . My Father has not heard Mad : Catalani being afraid of crouds . At the play I have been but once since my return to town , and that was on the occasion of Mr : Lewis 's farewell , having been 36 years in the profeſsion , and not leaving , at this day , by many degrees , his equal , on the Stage . He was much agitated , and so were all his friends . -- Covent-Garden new Theatre , will , they say , positively open on the 11 th : of September . What is to be done about rebuilding Drury-Lane , I do n't know . Mr : B—— is still in the same place . Sad work indeed , as you justly observe , has been paſsing , both in the moral and political world . The Paper of to-day , however , states , that Bonaparte has experienced a defeat on the Banks of the Danube . -- Pray give my love to Mr : Dickenson and Louisa , and remember me to Mrs : Bloſset , & c. How come the De Salis 's to be Count and Counteſs , all on a sudden ? I suppose by inheritance . -- I am in expectation of soon seeing , in town , some Irish friends of mine , that I met at Bath . They went thence to Cheltenham ; and I hear one of the Daughters is married , en paſsant . I do n't know what to say to those quick elections , but am sincerely interested for her . I must leave off now , having scrawled over all my paper . Very truly yours . Jane Holman . Mrs : Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire Single
