I ſhall be out of all patience with you , if you do not ride today ; and do not pay that bad Compt : to Mrs : Hamilton 's Understanding , to ſay you can not leave her a couple of Hours alone . -- You ſay , you my dear friend , you are now ſo much upon your Guard , you do not know are at a loſs to expreſs myself yourself in any Stile . -- With your prudence & good ſense , behold you then invulnerable . -- While I shall eve r lay myself open to Thoſe I believe my Friends . -- My best Wiſhes my dear Miſs Hamilton , ever attend you in every Attack & Defense , for I am ſure you will intend no Harm either with your Tongue or with your Pen . -- You forgot again mentioning our Lame friend . -- Adieu -- Your affecte : & c J.H .
