Dear Brother , I was really concern 'd to find by a letter I receiv 'd some time ago from Ly . Cathcart , that you thought you had reason to be displeased with my conduct towards you ; & particularly that I did not show that confidence in you , that you have so just a claim to from me . Tho ' there may be some appearance of foundation for a censure of this sort , yet I am sure , that upon reflexion , you have too much candor & humanity not to make the reasonable allowances for the caution neceſsary to be observed in my perplex 'd & unfortunate circumstances . I am conscious to myself of being incapable of the least reserve with you , when we are together , but still there are some things that it wou 'd be imprudent to communicate by letter ; let me therefore finally aſsure you , & I intreat you to believe me having never yet deceiv 'd you , that my silence to you , upon things that you have a right to be inform 'd of , can proceed from no other reasons than those I have mention 'd . I am already unfortunate enough , & must therefore feel the most sensible regret in being deprived of your friendship , upon which I have always relied & which wou 'd at all times be a real comfort to me . I paſs my time here but very heavily , when I may change the scene is as yet very uncertain tho ' I am determin 'd not to reside here much longer . My presence in Ireland will I fear be soon indispensably neceſsary , for my affairs there are in as bad a state as poſsible from Mr. Buttle 's having totally neglected them , he will not now condescend to acknowledge the receipt of my letters . I have added to this the chance of losing my Manager in the North who I hear is very ill. Let me caution you not to employ Mr. Buttle any more & not to let him have the keeping of any of your Papers . Your Leases are at present in the Hands of a Person whose honesty I can answer for , I think he shou 'd be caution 'd not to trust any of them out of his hands without your positive orders which I will remember to do the next time I write to him . I beg to be remember 'd affectionately to Mrs. Hamilton & to my Niece . I am ever Dear Brother , Yours most faithfully and Affectionately Frederick Hamilton York Novr . 23 d . 1763 . Mr. Frederick Hamilton Nov . 23 d 1763 . from York
