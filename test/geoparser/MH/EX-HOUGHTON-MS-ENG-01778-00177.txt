The day I dined with dear Mrs. Delany , I came home very serious ly ill and have never been out since . I am now recover 'd and hope to take wing to morrow . I am as you will believe so harried bringing out this little hasty Poem on the Subject nearest my heart , that I have only time to say that I will write when I have been long enough in the world to pick up any thing . Give my love to the Sposo , and kiſs the Brat for me . -- Mr. Walpole is charmingly well , and sat a couple of hours with me , since I have sat up for company . I spent the Christmas at Boyle Farm ; The new house is quite complete ; all the decorations are Miſs Boyle 's own doing .
