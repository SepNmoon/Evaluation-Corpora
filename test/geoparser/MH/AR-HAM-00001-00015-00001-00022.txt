Horton July 5 th 1787 My dear Friend ! Where are you , what is become of you ? que faites vous ? why do you never write -- you wrote me a few lines , weeks , nay I believe Month 's ago which I answered immediatly , promising me a longer letter soon -- you were in distreſs , in anxiety about Mr Dickenson 's Father who was ill in consequence of his fall -- what is become of all this ? he is well , I hope , quite recovered , & you have forgot , even the source of your misery -- Mr D . your dear little Louisa , all happy all well ! I like to think so , to please myself with the idea but why will you not allow me to hear the account , the confirmation of your happineſs from yourself . pray , pray write my dear Friend -- surely you have not forgot that your letters give me the greatest pleasure -- I will now tell you somethi n g of myself -- I am here depuis deux jours -- I spent a fortnight here immediatly after the Birthday , when I brought Bell down ; whom my Father had been so good as to leave with me , from the begin n i n g of May when he came to fix here -- I returned to London for a Drawingroom & staid almost a fortnig ht & here I am now for the Summer -- Summer it is thank God at last -- for when I was here in June we had fires every day -- now indeed the weather is heavenly , intensely hot , but we keep ourselves perfectly cool in the Salloon , where Bell & I have made our comfortable etabliſsement , & where we loll , & indulge our disposition to idleneſs for hours . Ly Wake was here in my absence , Bell says that , she is very well and Miſs Wake vastly grown & improve d we are going this Evening to Courteenhall , the very first visit I shall have made , but I am impatient to see Ly Wake , & to have some comfortable conversa tion with her , in London we met two or three times but you know what a morning visit is there . I had the pleasure of seeing Ly . Cremorne the other morning at Chapel at St James 's , she stayed as well as myself to receive the Sacrament , & I had only an opportunity afterwards of taking hold of her hand & asking her how she did -- she looked well -- I pitied her from my Soul . tell me my dear what are your Plans for this Summer , & how far I shall enter into them I will tell you what is my destination -- I remain here till the 5 th of September without any interruption . I shall then return for two fortnights , one about the end of September & beginning of October , & one the end of October & begin n i n g of November -- Now my dear tell me when you come into Northamtonshire for I conclude that you are under some promises to Lady Wake and the Cathcarts , whom by the by we are going to tomorrow , I flatter myself we have entered into your plans -- we depend on seeing you & Mr D . & I shall really be seriously angry with you if you do not come whilst I am here -- let me know what I am to hope for -- think my dear Friend that you we have been here six years , that you have been almost as often in Northamtonshire , & yet that 3 hours are the outside of the time you have paſsed with me -- I am thank God very well & recovering my looks a little -- delighted to be here , to be at liberty , to have no dreſsing , to go to bed at 11 & to breathe fresh air -- I am quite happy , in excellen t spiri ts , singing & laughing the whole day -- do y ou know me my dear Friend from this descript ion come & see how you like me -- come amongst us & make us happy -- God bleſs you & yours & continue to you , long , long all the Bleſsings you enjoy -- we all join & love to you & Compts to Mr D -- adieu once more , your affec CMGunning To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire single Sheet Honble Miſs Gunning July 1787
