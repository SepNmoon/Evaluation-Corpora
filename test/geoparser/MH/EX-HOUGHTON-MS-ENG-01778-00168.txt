Bristol July 5 1785 I have been sick , my dear friend , and I wou 'd not disturb with any thing so inauspicious as sickneſs the first moment of your happineſs , a happineſs which I sincerely believe and heartily hope , will be as durable as your life . My warmest congratulations and most affectionate good wishes attend you both . I was vastly happy to be delivered from the secret of your marriage with which I groaned and travailed . While I was at Mrs. Boscawen 's we went to Ken Wood , there I flatter 'd myself it wou 'd all come out , for Mrs. Boscawen had been continually inquiring when your happy day was to be , but I pleaded ignorance with the most natural air in the world . -- At Ken Wood however no discoveries were made , Lord Stormont had been very faithful to You . His lovely daughter said , in being preſsed to tell the day , that she hoped it wou 'd be soon , but she did not at all know when In paſsing thro ' Town , I received your kind little Note , which I intended to have answered at Oxford , but I behaved very ill there and kept my bed the whole time ; however dont waste any compaſsion on me , for I am tolerably well again . -- I return You a thousand thanks for the most precious of all books , a present I shall value thro ' time and thro ' Eternity ; a present which adds the highest value and confers the truest lustre on our friendship by informing us that it shall be immortal . A pleasant consideration this , and one that is worth cherishing , more than the busineſs and bustle of the world allows us to cherish it . I long to know the history of your life and adventures since we parted ; every thing that relates to You will be interesting to me . remember I left you setting off for your little retirement in the Country ; where did you go ? how long do you stay in town ? I had a letter , need I say a very agreeable one , from Mr. Walpole , he told me he had seen you well , and that he was terribly afraid You wou 'd make an excellent Wife , tho ' the treatment our dear Mrs. Vesey had met with from her abominable husband was enough to turn the whole Sex sour . He has made me quite rich and proud by his elegant present of books . I have read again the Mysterious Mother , with fresh admiration of writing , which is indeed admirable , and wi th fresh regret at his choice of a Story , objections to which can not ever be got over . But the more I read it the more I am surprised and sorry that he never shou 'd have turned his thoughts to dramatic Writing ; in point of character , and dialogue I think it much superior to any thing on the Modern Stage , and he has certainly seized the true Spirit of compositions of this sort , The curiosity is excited to a degree of impatience , and the interest never slack ens and he has contrived to throw more dignity round tha t excellent-execrable Woman than other Poets h ave given to their unstained characters . I am disappointed of A frank , but wo n't wait for it any long er Horace Walpole is with Mrs. Montagu -- Let me know where Mrs. Garrick is and all about her , that I may write to her . I have this moment a visit from the Russian Prince Mrs. Vesey -- do you know him ? -- write soon . Commend me kindly to Galitzin pray give my Compts to Mr. Dickenson Yrs . most truly Miſs Clarke To H More Clarges Street Piccadilly London
