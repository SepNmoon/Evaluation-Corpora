Dover Street 3 April 1782 My Dear Will King considering the Storms , and Violence of the Elements ; can not help , enquiring after my Friends , retired into Rural felicity ; to expose themselves to all the fury of it , and the danger of catching colds ; it will give me great pleasure to see you return safe , without any inconvenience ; and shall take the first opportunity of seeing you are so -- . news you can not expect , as every thing Bon Ton has left the regions of smoke , and , rather than be so vulgar as to remain ; are gone to be blown or wash 'd away in the Country : And the few odd folks that remain , are so busy talking of who is in , or , who is out : that news is totaly forgot , Miſs Hamilton was married Sunday evening the Bishop of Durham very ill with the Gout ; Mrs. Boughton was married yesterday to Miſs Mary Shirley Capt : Smith s nephew , Mrs. Tracey so bad with the Gout he was obliged to make Mr. Shirley his Deputy , to give his daughter away -- so matrimony and Gout , are much about -- I have had a letter from Naples , dated the 3 rd . of March from Caserta , in answer to mine ; Gen : Tryon spight of all our acusations , declares herself not guilty and tho ' at a loſs to acount , for her letters as well as ours being lost , seems to feel herself quite inocent : and says you ought not to complain as you are in her Debt , but as she sincerely loves and wishes you well She will write and tell you so very soon , she also promises , a letter to her old correspondents in this House : and clears herself about having wrote to Lady Hamilton as it was in answer to half a Dozen he had sent her -- She says the Court has been very gay by Mr. Beckford & the Grand Duke 's being there but that She has had so bad a winter as to health and nerves that She has excused herself to all the great fêtes ; but that She went to a private one Ducheſs of the Russia gave them and at which She did her the honor to present her to them . She describes the Queen as a very ugly little man : the length of his nose to his upper lip , longer than the nose itself ; very tottering , & weak in make , as well as constitution ; which one expects from a man that was declared incapable a few years ago of living , and that would not be suffer 'd to it , if he had ei g t her spirit or health to make a figure -- his Princeſs has person enough for both , being remarably tall and large : so that their apearance must be rather laughable , especialy as their fondneſs is so great as to Kiſs and toy in public , on which occasion her Highneſs is obliged to stoop or the little Prince could never reach her -- I should think if he has any feeling , he must have an Awkward one at Naples , as the Embaſsador from Ruſsia , was so great a favorite with his first wife as to occasion her to be poisoned : and as that may have been told his second it pleads some excuse for the great fondneſs She shews him : as she must be in continual dread of the like fate -- this acount a gentleman gave me that is lately returned from abroad and makes me no way envy the Brilliant situation of of such great Princes and Princeſses -- after all it is only Splendid Misery ! and our humbler lot by far the happiest at least having the power of chusing our situation , if we are unhappy , there is leſs room for compaſsion -- the weather has been so bad my Mother has not been able to get out , but has begun Aſses Milk and I hope you will find her much improved -- we all joyn in best wishes and in hopes of seeing you with Lillies & Roses from the Charms of Country Retirement remains Dear the Great Duke Your Affectionate Friend Miſs Hamilton Wil : King The Queens Lodge Windsor --
