Dear Mrs. Dickenson I am extremely glad to hear that you are recovering so well after your confinement & that your little acquisition is also in so good a state Mrs. Hamilton & my Daughter who desire to be rememberd to you , saw Miſs Ann Clarke yesterday , who gave them this agreeable information . You will do me the favor to give five guineas for me to your Nurse , which I will repay you with many thanks by the first opportunity . I have a Paper to be signed by you and Mr. Dickenson relative to your Bond which I discharged last year ; I suppose I may have a chance of seeing him in London , if not I will send the Paper to him , with the neceſsary instructions . My House is advancing extremely well , its situation is beyond measure beautiful & I believe the plan will not be disapproved of , my great object is that it may hereafter be worth to my family nearly the money that I shall expend upon it ; it is no doubt rather upon too great a scale for me , but you know when something moderate only is intended , our ideas enlarge as we advance , this is too often the case , & if we parry the censure of vanity , it is difficult to escape that of want of proper resolution . dont expect news from me , in such a place as Bath every thing is known immediately -- Robert is very well & grown a great size , the last time I saw him , when Madame Chauvet reproach 'd him for having a dirty face he answerd , je vous demande excuse c'est ma barbe Madame . I beg you will present my Compts . to Mr. Dickenson & believe me Dear Madam Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street N o . 248 Feby . 19 th . 1787 - Mr. Hamilton Feby 1787
