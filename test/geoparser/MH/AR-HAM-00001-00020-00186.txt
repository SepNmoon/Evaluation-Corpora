Wilton Lodge 1 st . August 1803 My Dear Sister , Will you never leave off your old Tricks & Must the labour of shewing that You are in the wrong , always be thrown on me ? I really admire the composed aſsurance , with which You are pleased to abuse me , in your Letter of the 23 d . July ; but , am by no means in the humour ffol for bearing unmerited Reproach . You know , are conscious , and can not deny , that You never answered my last Letter , written three Months ago ; that You are in the constant habit of treating me in the same way ; and then , forsooth , it is very extraordinary that I do not write to You ! ! ! I tell you once for all , that those who expect Letters from Me , must fire Gun for Gun , Letter for Letter , or else , my Ink shall not blot paper . Why should I waste my precious time , in scribbling nonsense to You , if You do not chuse either to return the same , or some of your blue Stocking Sense ? Major Cathcart , I apprehend , was not much concerned about the situation of my family , as he never enquired after them , from the time he heard of their illneſs , even unto this . Thank God , we are all in general health again , long ago . The influenza made a pretty General Attack on my Wife , Children , & Servants , but was civil enough to keep clear of me . Whether this proceeded from Respect towards His Majesty 's High Commiſsioner to the Church of Scotland , or from awe of my Dignity of His Majesty 's Lieutenant for Selkirkshire , I can not determine ; perhaps , you may , in your superior Wisdom , be able to account for it . Having now got to the bottom of my second Page , it is neceſsary to impreſs on your Mind , the exceſs of my condescension in writing to You at all , worried as I am in wi th Militia Acts , Supplementary Militia Acts , Defence of the Country Acts , Army of Reserve Acts , & innumerable other Acts to explain & amend the foregoing , with which I am daily & hourly pestered . I have rode more miles within these last six Weeks , attending Meetings of Lieutenancy , Justices & c. & c. & c. on all these important matters , than I believe I have done for six Years before . Tell Mr. Dickenson , I have suffered grievously , from the Saddle Sickneſs , and having five four more Meetings to attend between this , and the 16 th . of this Month , I know not what the consequence may be . We have had remarkably warm weather , and a dreadful Storm of Thunder & Lightening , which damaged several Houses , and killed many Sheep . I have not heard , of any human Life having been put an end to by it , in this Neighbourhood . I hope it has done no mischief with You . What a dreadful murder those Irish Villains have committed on Lord Kilwarden & his Nephew ? With such Foes internally , & Bonaparte without , the Autumn promises to be a busy one . If you run away from Beds , we may perhaps see You in your endeavour to get to some Cavern among the Highland Hills . I had forgot , that such Places may be found in Derbyshire . Wherever You & Yours take refuge , my best wishes & those of my Rib , will ever attend You . Therefore with hearty & cordial Love & affection to all at Leighton House , I remain ever My Dear Sister Your faithful Friend & Brother Napier Hawick , Second August 1803 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier . 10=9co 11=7
