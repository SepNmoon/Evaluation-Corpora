An Elegy after the manner of Sternhold & Hopkins Maria writes -- “ The Lizard 's dead ; ” An Elegy demands . In vain I beat my empty head , In vain I ink my hands . The Muses when invoked reply “ Your Pen You may resign , “ Our aid to Thee we 'll e'er deny “ The Sword is only thine . ” In strict Obedience to their Will I 'll paſs my future Days , And thirst to gain the Laurel still But pine not for the Bays . Tewin Water 2 July 1782 . This is the third sheet of Paper sacrificed to the Manes of my Dear Sister s Lizard . I received your letter in one of those many idle Hours which You say I am poſseſsed of . I instantly scribbled down the above Rhymes , and begun a Letter to You -- was interrupted , the Letter was thrown aside -- begun again -- and a second time thrown aside . Not for want of Affection , but from absolute downright Lazineſs . This confeſsion you must at least allow to be honest . The more busineſs a person has to attend to , the more time they find for doing it . But a Man who has nothing to do , loses an hour in the morning and is employed the rest of the Day looking for it . You may abuse me if you please , but this has literally been the case with me . The K . frenzy is now pretty well over -- The pretty Face & hand pleased for a Day -- was toasted for a Week and now gives way to the remembrance of one , who might have made me happy . I this morning received a letter from Lord Cathcart informing me of the Birth of his Son . I really rejoice very much upon this Occasion , He does not mention the Graham 's ; neither have they wrote to the Old Lady . I do not think she is exactly pleased with this . She begs to return you her best thanks for the Medallion in Paper . It was exhibited to every Visitor 'till one more favoured than the next was permitted to take it to copy , since which it has never been heard of . It grieves me to say that she has not been well lately . The influenza has hurt her considerably . She complains of swellings in her Face and a pain in her Ear -- eats little -- sleeps ill and her Legs swell . This is between ourselves . Ly . C . would never forgive me if she knew I had told you of her being indisposed . I hope however , the warm weather which we ought now to expect ( for we have not had above five Summer Days this Season ) will be of service to Her . Adieu . Beleive me ever Your very Affectionate Friend & Brother N——
