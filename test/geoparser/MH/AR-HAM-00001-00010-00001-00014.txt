Feby : 5 th 1782 This day must not paſs my ever dear & amiable friend without a Line from me -- yet I shall expreſs to my dearest friend very imperfectly the pleasure I feel in reflecting that it is her Birthday . May this day often very often return and always be attended with pleasing reflectxions to yourself as it will ever be dear to all who love you , among these am I too ambitious in desiring to be numbered ? with those near your heart ? As every return of this day has confirmed to me the happineſs I poſseſs in your friendship so may the future birthdays prove to you the sincere affection & perfect esteem with which I am & will be Yours Anna Maria Miſs Hamilton S t : James 's Palace
