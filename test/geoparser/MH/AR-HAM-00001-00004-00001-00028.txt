My Dear Mrs. Dickenson I beg you will accept my best thanks for your very obliging letter , which Mr. Greville brought me a few days ago enclosing the long & very satisfactory detail of the Academy at Brunswick , which I shall carefully lay by in case it shou 'd be an eligible plan some time hence to finish Robert 's education there ; at present tho ' there might be no objection as to his age , yet he is too little advanced in knowledge to receive benefit there ; but I have the satisfaction to acquaint you that he is really improving very much , & Mr. Chauvet has aſsured me that he is now satisfied with him . I am very glad to hear that Mr. Dickenson return 'd to you in good health , we had much leſs of his company than we cou 'd have wish 'd , & I am sure he is very obliging to represent the small attention it was in our power to shew him in so favorable a light . We all think extremely well of him , as he deserves . In spight of the Amusements of this Town I aſsure you , his impatience to return to your society was visible . I am glad to have it in my power to inform you that I shall be ready to pay £1025 being the Principal & Interest due upon your Heretable Bond on the 13 th . of May next . As this Bond will be Personal Property which I may convey by Will to whom I please , it will be neceſsary that Mr. Dickenson shou 'd make a Conveyance of it to me in the name of some Person as my Trustee , to guard against the objection of my appearing both Debitor & Creditor at the same time . I will write immediately to my Agent in Scotland for the proper Instrument & instructions , leaving a Blank for my Trustee whom I have not yet fixed upon ; but at all events the money shall be paid upon the day above mention 'd , upon my getting a proper discharge from Mr. Dickenson . The Heretable Bond shou 'd be sent to me without loſs of time for I apprehend it may be necessary to send it to Scotland . The money is at this time in Mr. Hammersley 's hands & shall be paid in the manner that will be most convenient to Mr. Dickenson without putting him to the trouble of a journey to receive it . We have all been in a most terrible alarm , which thank God is now over ; poor Ld . Brooke has been in the utmost danger at Winchester from a putrid fever & sore throat Lady Caroline & James Peachy have been there several days & I believe are not yet return 'd to London . Ld . Warwick was also with him ; I saw his letter to my Sister which was very satisfactory ; he was so well that he was to leave him the next day . We have no plan of any excursion for this summer & I rather think that I shall stay in Town the whole of it , saving my money , & attending to my Daughter s education who is still in the hands of many Masters . I think she is improving & have the satisfaction of being told so by others who may be better judges . Mrs. Hamilton & your cousin desire to be affectionately remember 'd to you & Mr. Dickenson to whom I beg you will present my best Compts . believing me ever Dear Mrs. Dickenson Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Bedford Square April 13 th . 1786 .
