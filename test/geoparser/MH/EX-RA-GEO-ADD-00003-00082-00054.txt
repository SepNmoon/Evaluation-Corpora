Satry . Morng . Octbr . 23 d . 1779 -- My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , Miranda I thank you very much for ye . Books you was so good as to send me , I have not as yet been able to look into ye . first you sent me , as I ha d v e still a little more to read in order to finish another Book which my Brother was so good as to lend me , & as my jaunts to W——r you know , are not famous for leaving me much time upon my hands , I could not read much while I was there , however I will now immediately set about reading ym .. & will read ym .. with great attention , & mark ye . s parts according to yr . permiſsion that I like best . Oh my Friend since I wrote this Yesterday Evening a Scene paſsed upon my account , which gave me infinite pain pains and drew tears from most of ye . Bystanders . Upon my entering my Mother 's Room last Night , who should I see there to my great surprise but ye . poor Ducheſs of A——r , I thought she looked very grave and particularly so when I made one bow to her but with an Air of affection or rather of tenderneſs yt . struck me very much . She , as well as many other people have reckoned me ye very image of her poor late Son to whom I was always singularly attached , as I always looked upon him to be , a very honest , open goodhearted young Man which he really was notwithstanding all his wildneſs . Well then soon after I had been in ye . Chamber , & after some mutual expreſsions of tenderneſs had paſsed between my Mother & me , which recalled to her memory her Son 's tenderneſs towards her , which was always very remarkable , ye . Poor Woman rose out of her place in an agony of grief , & retired into another Apartment . There my a m iable Mother soon followed her to sympathise with her in her grief , every body immediately gueſsed ye . occasion of ye sudden emotion of ye . poor D——s when my Mother returned & declared yt . to be ye . reason which I have mentioned above . I saw ye . tears trickle down my Mother 's Cheeks for I saw perceived she cd .. not help putting herself in ye . same situation to which her affection for me , ( which I thank ye Almighty , I may say is very great ) prompted her . My heart felt very much for ye . poor Woman , so that it was painful to me to refrain from tears for some time . I know what my Mary Bertie wld .. have suffered had she been present , not only from ye knowledge I have of her excellent heart , but from what she felt upon a similar occasion . But enough of this melancholy subject for ye . present I am afraid of interesting yr . tender feelings My Miranda too much for yr . Spirits , for I am always very much afraid , & indeed avoid as much as is in my power mentioning any such dismal subject , for fear it shd .. be detremental to yr . health , because I know how much you love to brood over such melancholy topics . I am sorry my dearest friend & Sister yt . I am not to have ye . happineſs of yr . Company at W——r , you know from what I have often told you yt . it is not flattery when I tell you it is so to me , however tho ' I have ſhall ye first Afternoon I am there seat myſelf upon yr . Chair & think how many happy moments I have paſsed with my Miranda in yt . spot & how many more I have yet to come tho ' I have you not in person with me , yet I have you always with me for yr . dear image is so thoroughly imprinted in my heart yt . nothing but Death itself can eface it . I am my dearest dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , friend Yr . sincerely affectionate Brother Miranda . toujours de même . P.S . Pray excuse ye abrupt conclusion of this Letter for I am hurried away by Palemon . Pray let me have a long Letter from you upon my return from W—— as you shall have from me . We have had good accoun ts from my dear B—— A——d -- A . A . A . toujours chére .
