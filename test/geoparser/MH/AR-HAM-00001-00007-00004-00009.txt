13 th - Sepbr- 1782 I think it scarcely neceſsary to inform my dear Miſs Hamilton how much I felt myself flatterd by her kind remembrance of me -- I consider her present as emblematical and I shoud risque a Comment on it , had I not been informd that she looks on me in the Light of a sawcy Poet & fastidious Critic -- If she had calld me a poor Poet -- well but how a fastidious Critic ? I find it very awkward to addreſs you in the third person , it seems to mark a distance different from that which arises from respect -- I have read Warton 's verses they are I think good , I shall say no more at present but shall leave the subject for future Canvaſs during the many many melancholy hours I have spent alone this Summer , my thoughts have not been wholly unoccupied , I have read much , & if to little purpose on points of Improvements , still I hope the Labor has not been altogether useleſs -- I have written a small Poem which I mean at some future period to present submit to your Criticism , altho it must have rather the appearance of vanity , since I never coud boast of any such favor from you , when at the same time I know you have had it in your power to oblige me on that head . Beleive me the fastidious Critic in judgements on your works woud subject himself to an imputation of Partiality . The Lobster Claws are now before me , I look on them with pleasure ; I understand you sent them with smile ; they have , I know no t how , a power of soothing the soul into a sweet Complacency ; you are a Naturalist & can perhaps explain this power inherent in Lobster Claws ; for my part I never saw any like these . Adieu & beleive me unalterably yrs J. F . Miſs Hamilton Queen 's Lodge Windsor
