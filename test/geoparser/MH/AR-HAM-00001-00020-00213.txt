Edinburgh , 25 th . April 1807 My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 12 th - Instant has remained unanswered , because it was not in my power to say anything about my Appointment , as His Majesty 's High Commissioner , till this morning , when I received Lord Hawkesbury Letter Announcing its having taken place . So , now I must hunt about for my Purse Bearer , my Aſsisting Minister , my two Pages , my four Ushers , my Eight Footmen , my Two Chairmen , Macers , Confectioner , & c , & c , & c. I desire You may feel the full force of the Obligation You are under to me , for sparing this precious moment , which ought to be employed in making my Arrangements , such as Contracts with Tavern Keepers , & Wine Merchants . I am just going to order Wines of all sorts , and also Gin , Rum , & Brandy , the Reverend Divines not being much accustomed to drink Claret , on other occasions , feel it neceſsary to qualify that Liquo r by fortifying their Stomachs with a Dram . We shall have some squabbling on the first day of the aſsembly , as there is a Clerkship Vacant , which , though not worth above £80 , or £90 pr Ann . has been considered so consequential , that the late Ministry have left no stone unturned , to procure Members to be sent up , who are inclined to support their favourite Candidate . The friends of the present Ministry have been equally active , and , I believe , have secured the point , but , as I take no part in the busineſs , I do not venture to ask much about it . The appointment of Procurator was Vacant last Year , and the Election was carried against the Candidate of the late Ministers , by three to one . From this , You will understand that “ All the Talents ” had not won the affections of the Scottish Clergy . When I first went to Parliament , Lord Grenville appeared to me so sensible , so much in earnest , and so honest , that I would readily have pinned all my political faith on his Opinion . His conduct , when last out of Office , and when last in Office , almost gives me a disgust at Politics altogether , as Sincerity does not appear to be a neceſsary Virtue , in that Science . His worthy Nephews are chuckle heads . Your young Chief , the Marquis of Douglas deserves the Grand Knout & a Trip to Siberia , for his folly , ( I had almost written wickedness ) for exposing the confidential communication of the English Merchants , to the Ruſsian Government . Adieu , My Dear Sister , My Purse Bearer is just announced , & I must conclude , wishing You and Yours every poſsible benefit from your Jaunt to Cheltenham With best Love to You all , I ever am , Your faithful Friend , and Affecte Brother Napier Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds
