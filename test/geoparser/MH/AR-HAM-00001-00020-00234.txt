27 , S t . James 's Street 20 th . April 1809 My Dear Sister , I have been detained here a Week longer than I expected . But I told Lord Liverpool yesterday , that I would depart on Monday . As the Parents of my Servant live within three miles of St. Albans , I mean to sleep there that Evening , to give him an opportunity of fulfilling his Filial Duties . On Tuesday , I trust , I shall be with You about two O'Clock , and shall remain till Wednesday Morning , when I purpose to proceed to Archy Cathcart 's . With my best Love to Mr. Dickenson & Louisa , I ever am , My Dear Sister , Your Affectionate Brother & faithful Friend Napier Best Compts- to my Countrywoman . My black Seal , is for Lady Cecilia Johnstone 's Son , who died lately .
