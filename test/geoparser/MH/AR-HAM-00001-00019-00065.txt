Yours My dear Ward came to hand only a few hours ago , occasioned by my having been from home on a jaunt to Stirlingshire and Schaw Park / Ld Cathcart s/ otherwise you may be persuaded I should not have been so long in anſwering so kind a letter from one I have so great a regard for & who I am extremely sensible does me great honor by her friendship , which I am in hopes will still continue , all I shall ſay in regard to yours , is that it was wrote like yourself with that delicacy , friendship , & good ſense particularly the Characteristic of Miſs Hamilton that few or none could can come up too , Believe me that I am extremely obliged to you & Mrs Hamilton for that kind concern you both shew to me & I thank God my health is ſince I have been in the country greatly mended for the better & so is my spirits tho I must ſay very , very little effects both at times , tho I do everything in my Power to keep both as they should be & am in hopes that if I can get this Winter over I shall reestablish my health entirely . I was extremely obliged to you for your long letter ſome weeks ago with your most entertaining description of the places you saw with L in yo ur jaunt with Lady Wake to Bath & c but you will forgive me in not anſwering that letter particularly till I get home & have more time on my hands than I poſsibly can have abroad tho I must just mention one thing which is that if you do not take a little more care of your health than you have done lately by your own account , you may ruin your constitution entirely , allow me to scold a little my friendship for my dear Ward entittles me to do it to Miſs Hamilton , you are too sanguine ( if I may be allowed to make use of the word ) in your pursuits of any thing you like , for which reaſon after its over your body suffers & you get a fever which brings you to deaths door & you are surprised that your constitution of body , is not as strong as that of your mind believe me my dear Ward too much fatigue is not the thing for you , you think yourself much stronger than you really are , witneſs you r meeting with your mama after your jaunt , those fitts will become more frequent if great care is not taken to prevent ſuch a sensibility getting the better of a Constitution not the strongest in the world . If I have ſaid too much I beg pardon of Miſs Hamilton and make no doubt but any ward will forgive my doing my duty as a Guardian . You may be ſure I shall ſend you ſome more of these odes if I can get them but the author is not always in a humour to oblige me and has really threatned that the last I sent you would be the last of his compoſition in that way & he is rather of the Mule Kind when he takes it into his head & is not fond of that sort of writing however I shall do my best to oblige you Lord Cathcart & family join my three eldest young folks in best wishes to you & Mrs Hamilton & I hope you will not forget me to her in the most affct manner & Compliments to all my friends in Northampton -- Has you & Mrs s made it up yet ? that is a story you will not trust me with however believe me to be wth the greatest truth My dearest Ward Yrs most affctly Shaw Park Sepr , 6 th - 1774
