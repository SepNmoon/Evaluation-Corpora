Febry . 15 th . 1786 My dearest Mrs. Dickenson Dear A Maria has had an answer from Doctor Warton , you will not tell her that I sent you a Copy of it , as she desired me not to Show it . The letter is as follows -- Dear Madam -- I most certainly should have paid my respects to you in Town , if I really had not been nearly hurried into a second illneſs by having so much to do in so short a time , & this also must be my excuse for not calling on Mrs .. & Miſs Glover . I must aſsure you it was impoſsible I should take amiſs any part of her letter .. if she meant that paſsage in which she says she would not trouble me to write Mr. Glover 's Life , it most certainly , can not be that paſsage for the plain & clear fact is , that thinking attentively on the subject I easily saw that I had absolutely no materials to go upon , coming , especially , as I did so late in Life into Mr Glover 's acquaintance , that of all knowing the busy scenes in which he had been engaged . So that in truth I could not write the a Life having no facts to build upon . As to the publication of the peices we mention 'd , I am sure Miſs Glover was welcome to my op p inion , but I still think that it might be improper to publish the Memoires though they appear to be very curious . As Mr Glover himself mention 'd Mr. GloverCadell Cadell for as a printer , I should imagine it might be right to employ him . But I am griev 'd to say that I greatly fear Miſs Glover will be disappointed in what the booksellers will offer for the Copy . For Alaſs the real & intrinsic value of the Peices will not be consider 'd but what is likely to sell ( as they call it ) If the second part of Jason should be acted I should think it may be very advantageous . Now my dearest friend tell me what you think of think of the letter , & if you have not wrote you will now know what to do . I have seen the Provost of Eton , who was so good as to ask Mr. Cadell what he would give me for the Copy of the Athenaid he enquired the length , when he heard it was thirty Books , he said it was too long , that he could not answer for its selling , adding that if I chose to have it curtail 'd that he would undertake to publish it & that we should share & share alike in the profits & loſses , but if I did not chuse to have it alter 'd , he would print it for me in the common way , which is in fact for me to be at all the expence , anxiety & trouble of publishing it myself , then in all probability the account between me & the printer will not be settled for years . You see what Dr. W : says about Jason , Dr. Roberts , the Provost of Eton , & Mr Collier think it is better not to publish the trajedies , but to print the Athenaid alone & see how that will take with the public , if it takes , then to publish all the works , you will not wonder , that I am very anxious with all this upon my mind , I wish I had you here to consult with , you must write to me & tell me all your thoughts upon this the above written subject , I am perplex 'd & bewilder 'd , one thing I am resolv 'd upon , which is not to part with them for a triffle , that I think my dear friend will be doing my dearest Father s memory an injury . What do you think of Doctor Warton 's writing a kind of preface , instead of a life , & making an apology for the length of the poem & saying that had the Author lived it would have been shorten 'd & much corrected , but that I was unwill i ng for the public to lose a poem of his writing & therefore had by the advice of my friends publish 'd it in its present incorrect style . I ask your advice , knowing you will give it me with sincerity . Tell me whether I shall write to Dr .. W myself , & tell me what I shall say to him . I have got a frank for you , A. Maria & myself take it alternately to get them , She call 'd here last night & look 'd very well , she was going to Mrs : Gunning 's in Old Burlington St .. -- On Friday M r .. D—— dines at Mr. Hamilton s , we all go in the evening , Mrs. H—— has had a very bad cold & cough she is grown thinner . -- My charming Brother never comes near us , he has £950 a year a single man , does not keep house , is only in Lodgings , constantly dines out , & yet is not able to keep a carriage , he is I make no doubt very much in debt , he call 'd the other day on A. Maria , but made no enquiries after us . It is a dreadful thing to have bad Children , Alas , my dearest Father experie nced it too much , I hope the Amiable Lady Wake will be happy in her 's , I make no doubt but that Sir William by his tender behavior & aſsidous care to please her , tries as much as poſsible to make her some amends for the loſs she has sustain 'd , A child can not behave too grateful , to such a parent as Lady Wake . My dearest mother behaves in the kindest manner to me , she will not suffer me to pay any thing for my board , but I live with her exactly as I used to do when my Father was living , you know she does nothing in a little way , & you will be happy when I tell you , if poſsible we grow more attach 'd to each other every day , She is I thank God perfectly well in health , & the charming society of your excellent husband has improv 'd her spirits , you are bleſs 'd in each other , he seems to be never so happy as when he is talking of you , when he receives your letter 's they are saluted every time he reads them , I wish all men were like your Dickenson & all women like yourself what a paradise should we live in , I am only afraid we should be too happy for this mortal life . God preserve you long for each other is the ardent wish & your ever oblig 'd & affection ate Mary Glover pray present our Compts . to Lady Wake & the rest of the Family Mrs. Dickenson M Master
