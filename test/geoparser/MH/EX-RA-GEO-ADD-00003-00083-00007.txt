21 August 177 9 Ah my friend you little imagine what a terrible black list I am going to produce -- it may sound harsh , but as I am detiremin 'd to have my conscience perfectly free & never to deceive you I must say you have lower 'd yourself in my esteem -- if you think it worth while to repair the fault you have committed -- keep to yourself what I am going to say for if you do not I will not take upon me to answer for ye . consequence , after this preface -- I desire you will recollect what you said & wth . whom you convers 'd ( particularly ye . Eveg . of yor . B.D . ) -- I have warn 'd you not to trifle wth . my feelings , -- I have more sensibility than vanity , & believe me the latter never will receive any gratifications at the expence of ye former ; I need not explain this further , you have penetration enough to find out what I mean -- the only favor I request is , & wch . I do very earnestly -- that you will not reproach your confidant with want of secrecy -- I acknowledge I shall have no ambition to be rank 'd among ye . number of yor . friends if they are all of the same claſs -- yet again my friendship must remind you -- you will suffer more than you are at present aware on , if every insignificant character is to be deem 'd worthy of your confidence . among the other reprehensible things in your conduct , & wch . I mark 'd down in my memory -- is the indelicate ungentlemanlike & wicked practice you have thought proper to adopt of Swearing -- think what a pleasant circumstance it was for me . the morng . of ye . Review to hear a man ( who stood near ye carriage I was in ) saying to another -- “ what was ye . P in such a paſsion about ? ” -- “ in a paſsion repeated ye . other ” -- why Yes replied he “ for just now when he came riding up alone to ye . attendant he “ said damn the fellow -- ye . Devil take him -- “ where is the Devil gone ” & c. & c. & c . ” after this remarks were made upon such language having been made use of by you . I declare to you I cld . have wept with vexation & that vexation was added to by your trifling conversation with Ld : Lothian & c -- the expletives -- upon my word -- & upon my honor a Man of real honor never w d venture s to make use of unleſs to a truth -- they never ought to be used as “ words of Course in common conversation ” this was your excuse to me . I wd . recommend you to read a paper in the Connoiſseur upon this Subject -- I have not the book but I recollect that I was pleas 'd I have such a detestation of any thing relative even in ye . most trivial occurences of to deceit -- that I must tell you You say vanity it even extends to ye piece of Myrtle that was taken & thrown away immediately after . -- Adieu you have paid me a number of fine Compliments . I can not say I can pay yo . any upon your judgment & taste respecting Beauty -- yt . how ever is of little consequence -- as to ye . other perfections yo . fancy I poſseſs I shld . be well pleas 'd to find ym . out , or be able to attain ym- farewel I have acted honestly by yo .. I have told yo . truths , ye . conversation of yr . fencing Master may be more pleasing to yor . taste -- he will boast of yor . condescension & c but I shall feel that I act as a real friend ought . have acted more honestly by you -- I have told you truths . the conversation of your Fencing Master may be more pleasing to your taste he will boast of your condescension & c. but I shall feel that I act as a real friend ought farewel . before I close my Letter permit me to add a few lines more & pardon me if I have already trespaſs 'd too long upon yor . patience . If I cld . poſsibly foresee that ye . attachment yo . at present paint in such strong terms wld . be more than transient -- or wd . hereafter influence any of yor . actions -- I declare in ye . most solemn manner -- I wld . take a step ( wch . though I was certain wd . embitter all my future happineſs in this world ) wch . wd . effectually put a bar between us -- I never will betray yor . confidence to a human being & I never will be the cause of Your acting improperly . I have somewhere read -- “ greater “ Virtues are neceſsary to preserve ones friends than to acquire them ” The Monthly Review for April 1750 , p.436 , a translation of some of the aphorisms in A. Goudar , Pensées Diverses ; or , Miſcellaneous Thoughts , in French , London : Vaillant and Meyer . . & again “ let us have a care above all things , “ yt . our kindneſs be rightfully founded , for where there is any “ other invitation to friendship than ye . friendship itself yt . friendship will be bought & sold . he derogates from ye . dignity of it yt . makes it only dependent upon apreciable circumstances ” Sir Roger L'Estrange , Seneca 's Morals by Way of Abstract : To which is Added , a Discourse Under the Title of An After-thought , 12th edition , rev . by Nathanael James , 1735 . London : Dormer , xviii.178 . . I do not know if my memory has been faithful in ye . above quotations but ye . sense will serve to explain my sentiments . One quotation more & I have done conclude Some positive persisting fops we know , Who if once wrong , will needs be always so ; But you with pleasure own yr . errors past And make each day a critique on ye . last . Those best can bear reproof who merit praise Alexander Pope , An Essay on Criticism , Part III . My friend Adieu
