5 th Septr- My friend -- I am not going to torment you with my usual remonstrances on the impropriety of our correspondence -- my heart & mind are satisfied as to the perfect rectitude of my intentions both now & hereafter -- Our coinciding minds & similarity of sentiments promise the continuance of a friendship beyond which I wish not to see -- there is only one circumstance wch . preys upon my mind , & wch . I own the idea of w ch . renders me at times very unhappy -- it is the unfortunate nece≈øsity of acting in a clandestine manner -- it hurts at once my delicacy & my pride , & if by any unforeseen chance it should hereafter be discovered -- the two persons most dear to you , would naturally judge me with great severity -- This event , were it to happen would absolutely break my heart -- for I never could have courage or resolution to make my own defence -- indeed how could I excuse my conduct , being so conscious of its being apparently wrong -- Your Mother would detest me as being a most designing artful character -- not a human creature -- I am well persuaded -- not even my best friends would do me strict justice -- though they might judge differently on ye . affair -- How would those who are devoid of sentiment deride the declaration of a disinterested & pure friendship subsisting between persons of such different situations in life I will teaze you no longer on this subject
