Play tomorrow , I will therefore put off dining at your House tomorrow as I know that the night you go to ye .

I leave it to you to make a polite & proper excuse to Sir Robert Gunning -- I shall merely get a glimpse of you This time for we return to Windsor on Friday , but the next excursion we make , will be the last for some time -- most probably till Easter -- The Queen had me the honor of coming to my apartment ( when I was writing I was interrupted writing to you by hearing the Queen s voice , she did me the honor & pleasure to bring her work & sat with me a long time in friendly converse -- I find by her , The Princeſs Royal does not go to The Play Therefore I shall not , as I expected , gain an Evg . -- I have got through Luc i an , have you ? -- East Bourne July 23 d . 1780 I went to Beachey head , would I could convey to you the sensations of my mind on ye . sight of ye Stupendous scene made more awful than any idea I could have formed -- I believe I mentioned before , having seen these Cliffs -- but then I had not seen them to advantage ye . same advantage , as the tide had prevented our going far enough -- You tell me you love me more than ever -- I feel gratefully sensible -- You warn me to guard against the Queen -- Ah my Dr- why so ? I know she is good & amiable , I have always loved her since I knew her , & if she has true friendship for me , wch . I think , & hope she has , -- it surely must be perfectly disinterested . I well know mine for her is & ever shall be so . If you do not believe this -- You know me not Adieu my Dr . frd- 4/ The fatigue of standing upwards of 3 hours last night , as we did not play at Cards , has made me paſs a very bad sleepleſs night , I am not yet up but I roused myself to send you the earliest intelligence that her Majesty ordered me to advise you to use Leeches to your gums , she said they would prove a certain remedy -- Mrs : C : did so yesterday & it removed the pain she had suffered for 10 days . S t . James 's Palace 1782 East Bourne August the 14 th 1780 I took a pleasant ride of 12 Miles yesterday afternoon Mr. Farhill was my Esquire , we attended my kind Friends who came here on purpose to visit me in their way to Tunbridge -- viz : Miſs W : King -- Mrs- Genl- Tryon , her Daughter , & Mrs : Leland -- I was not the least tired wch : I should have been had I walked only two miles -- Mrr . F : has been so obliging to get me some franks for you from his Brother in Law Coll . Tuffnel -- he appears an amiable young Man -- indeed I think both Mr : Fisher & himself are equally deserving -- they are great friends wch : is a happy circumstance -- for they have an insolent overbearing Man to deal with in the Governor , who is better calculated for a negro driver than the situation he is in -- The Man however is not unpleasant in his manners to Ladies , or his superiors -- he has seen much of the world & lived in good society , -- & he enlivens conversation by anecdotes . He told me he was wth . Lord Townsend when Ld . Lieutenant in Ireland -- I believe Aid de Camp . He also went to Italy & c. with the rich Young Pelham . 5 8 th . June 1780 Friday Eveg I expect you early tomorrow Morng . -- what times what dreadful times , what horrid Riots -- The Dear King ! how does he shine like a constellation , but I should say like a true Christian -- I am firmly persuaded Lord George Gordon is insane -- my heart has ached too much for me to put pen to paper -- twenty times have I begun writing to you -- I hope you have been happier than myself -- we go to Eastbourne at 5 o Clock on Monday Morng . Her Majesty kindly wished ( this a secre t ) to detain me with her , but as she had told Lady Charlotte Finch she should chuse either to have Miſs Goldsworthy or myself , & Lady Charlotte chusing me , I am to go -- yet the Queen was affectionately pleased , as she told me she thought Sea air & Bathing would do me good & she should have great pleasure in corresponding with me I wish I could convince you that the Queen has real sensibility -- 23 d S . Eastbourne 23 d . Sepbr . 1780 An expreſs arrived this Morng . that her Majesty was safely delivered of a Son -- the Princeſs Royal wrote me a kind letter also of information -- I hear we are to leave this place in 11 days -- do not my lovely friend let your family jarring take such hold of your spirits Pardon me , but I think you all seem to contrive to torment each other -- wch . is most strange as you are so extremely , & I may say , so uncommonly attached . 6 ) S t . James 's Palace 1 st . Janry 1782 -- It is not in my power to go to you this Morng -- let me know how you do , & if ye . pain in yr- face is gone . It will afford me great happineſs to know the new Year smiles upon you , & that you enter upon it in Health & spirits -- May you , from henceforth , enjoy every happineſs Virtue & goodneſs merit , & which I think you deserve -- I hope our friendship will continue in this world , & when we quit it may we hope to meet in the next , & may we merit that Heaven wch . is the reward of the righteous . tenderly Yours Mary Hamilton East Bourne Suſsex 8 th June 1780 I told you I had seen Herts Herstmonceux it is about 10 Miles from hence , we did not rail at the ravages of time , but at the mean wretch who destroyed this noble Pile of Building , far from the time of Henry the 6th- till within these 4 Years it was in habitable repair , nothing but the outside walls are left standing wch : while they last will be a Monument of shame to Mr : Hare -- it is situated in a fine Park well wooded , the Ground is finely disposed , & a view of the great Ocean crowns the prospect , the Present owner has just finished a Modern House near this once Noble Castellated Masion with its Materials -- the Architect they told me was Mr- Samuel Wyatt -- a Man in Vogue : Herstmonceux was built by Sir Roger Fiennes in 1423 . The dimensions of a most noble lofty spacious Room is still to be traced . Addison wrote his comedy of the 7 Drummer or Haunted House when on a Visit to this Mansion -- a suitable place to create such ideas -- The ancient Furniture & curious carved woodwork of this room is in the new House . East Bourne August 31 st . 1780 I feel so much for you my Dr . friend that I sincerely regret I can not be with you & aſsist you in attendance on your worthy Father -- I hope your Sister is very attentive , but I ought not to doubt it , as I believe she has a good , & an affectionate heart -- & it is at such a time when one feels -- how much we love -- how much we owe -- how much we should lose -- endeavour Dear friend to keep up your spirits , I know you will from every right & good motive . I told you in my last of our having been a little excursion -- it was to Ashburnham , the Seat of Lord Ashburnham 's abt . 14 Miles from hence -- a very fine situation -- the Park is 7 Miles in circumference -- the Ground finely disposed by Nature , and highly improved by 15 years labour & skill of Mr- Browne -- I dare not presume to say that If I was the employer of Brown I should suggest some alterations wch . would be more accordant to my ideas of picturesque beauty -- but I may say to you that I think my great Uncle Charles Hamilton s taste would have made this place more renowned for true simplicity & c & c & c -- The views from many parts the views are extensive -- they told us one might see to the distance of 60 miles -- there are 8 . there are charming rides through the Park , -- Water -- & c & c , & a Noble view of the Sea on wch . are easily distinguished Veſsels sailing , without the aſsistance of Glaſses , & to crown the scene the Downs rising to the Clouds Sky , we had a distinct view of the Grand ruins of Battle-Abbey , wch- appeared but two miles distant -- I believe it is four -- I regretted we could not go to it -- It is memorable for being raised upon the Spot where Harold s Body was found , by William stiled ye- Conqueror , as a pretended attonement for the horrid quantity of human Blood shed in that encounter . I am informed Battle Abbey Called the Conquerors Abbey ( Built by William . ) is charmingly situated , it belongs to Sir George Webster , & it is now partly inhabited by a L W idow Lady Webster . It was pointed to our observation , at no great distance , an eminence called Standard Hill , the place where William the invader , or Conqueror , erected his Standard on landing . The Abbey was one of the most magnificent edifices of that kind in England -- It was reduced to a wreck by the furious zeal of the Reformers The Gates I am told remain , which are very grand . In Ashburnham Church is kept the Shirt the unfortunate Charles ye first wore the day he was beheaded , & the Sheet wch : covered his body . An Ancestor of Lord Ashburnham was Groom of the Bedchamber to the King , & out of attachment contrived to get & preserve them . The shirt is what we should think 9 . think very coarse Linnen -- it has a Vandyke falling down collar similar to what we see in the Portraits of this Monarch -- & of the costume of that time -- it is curiously ornamented with variety of stiches in needlework by some skillful sempstreſs , or perhaps Sailor -- N : B : not in colors but white Thread . I likewise saw the King s watch wch he gave his faithful Friend & Servant , Mr. Ashburnham , the morning of his execution -- it is finely enameled in colors withing ( on Gold ) withing & without . -- has no glaſs but shuts up like a Box . I saw the D ai ry wch . I admired -- it is well furnished with fine Old Delf , China & c -- in it is a Milk Pail , called Queen Elizabeth s , it was brought from Greenwich -- it is a pretty round small pail of white wood , with a round plain silver handle , & broad rims of Silver , encircle the top & bottom of the pail , These rims are engraved , & there are arms -- but not those of Elizabeth -- but like those belonging to the Shirley 's . -- The House suits the situation , The Rooms are Large , Light , & handsome ; -- the furniture neither old , n or very modern , n or elegant . Lord Ashburnham had intentions of new furnishing it , but poor Ly : A 's miserable state of health preventing her being so distant from medical advice in London makes him defer it ; -- I was obliged to leave Ashburnham without seeing the Gardens wch . I regret -- I hear they are in ye . stile of his Majesti es at Richmond -- but wth . greater natural advantages . 10 ) March 24 th - 1780 -- To what my friend am I to attribute your extroadinary change of manner & coldness towards me , it was your Father & yourself who courted my acquaintance -- I by no means sought yours -- you may remember you both engaged Miſs Tryon to bring you to my apartments at S t - James 's -- Your Father almost with tears intreated I would let you be rank 'd among the number of my friends & I recollect paid me many fine compts . on ye . character he had heard of me & c & c -- You have ever since ( till your return from Bath ) -- expreſsed in the warmest terms that I was , ( excepting Sr : Rt : your Brother , & Sister ) the dearest to your heart of any other human being , & from the extroadinary proofs , of your by the confidence , you placed in me I really thought I was . You are become a votary to diſsipation & I lament to observe you now aſsociate with persons I shun , & whose conduct you have condem̅ed , It is not the first time I have been disappointed -- but I am not yet grown calous , & I own I am wounded ; -- In you I expected to find steadineſs of character superiour to those Moths whom it is easy to predict will soon or late fall victims to dangers they seem to court . 24 th : March 1780 I am very sorry to receive so bad an account of your Health & spirits , one should imagine the diſsipation you are so constantly engaged in ( 11 in would rouse the latter , however prejudicial it may & must be it may be to the former . Mrs : Vesey desired me to ask you to go to her on Saturday Eveg -- she is removed to their new House in Clarges Street -- if you have no objection to meet any thing so stupid & sober as myself , I will make a point of being there for otherwise I despair of seeing you as our time draws near for my quitting Town -- with Their Majesties -- the 3 e lder Princes Pſs : Royal & Augusta -- we go on Sunday and are to Windsor & shall not return till Wednesday sennight -- The rest of ye . Royal Children remain in Town wth . Ly C—— Miſs G—— & c & c as usual -- Adieu you will ever find me the same . My excellent friends Mr. Smelt , Mrs : Carter , & c Breakfast with me tomorrow . 24 th . March 1780 You think my note cruel & unkind , & I felt even more than I expreſsed -- I require nothing more of you my Dr . friend than that you will be consistent -- let your own mind be the guide of your own actions -- I did not doubt but that you had an affection for me , but I am too honest not to say , that it appeared to me , in proportion as you seemed to court the notice & acquaintance of ye . Great the Daſ s hers of the hau t-ton you shrank from me -- I have had such painful proofs of ye . mutability of ye . human heart that I did not condemn you , but regretted my loſs , -- hence I justify my expreſsion , & make it 12 ) it agreeable to my feelings ie . “ That I should always be the same ” Come to me at ½ past ten o'clock tomorrow Morng -- Adieu I have only time to add that I embrace you with tenderneſs and sincerity Mary Hamilton I am delighted with your Hungarian , 't is from the conversation of such persons one gains what Books can not teach . -- I wish you would keep away from such crowded dinner parties -- I do not wonder , with your very delicate health , that they make you ill ! The variety also of smells , & particularly at the German Tables you mention -- A Dish of smoking Sour Crout will at any time affect one sufficiently to overcome all desire of eating for that day , though it was often at my Father 's Table , I never could endure it -- The worthy Genl Freytag has tried to bribe me various ways to relish it but without suc̅eſs we are great friends , but I think I shoud be still a greater favorite wth him could I conquer my dislike to Sour Crout . ( 13 Lady Betty Compton s Gardens , Eastbourne Sea Seat Septr . 4 th . 1780 You will my Dear perceive from whence this is dated that I was detirmined this post should not depart without a few lines to you -- Lady Charlotte Finch remained at her own Lodgings to write letters , -- Princeſs Elizabeth & my sweet engaging Child Princeſs Sophia are playing about like innocent Butterflies in the Sun , & culling the wild flowers on the Graſs , whilst I am watching them , & yet scribb l ing to you , to prevent your thinking any occupation either of duty , or pleasure , or diſsipation could render me unmindful that you was not well , I earnestly wish you would see our attentive , kind & skilful Doct . Turton oftener , it may be extremely improper for you to continue , for any length of time , medicines , or even the Bath water -- change of prescription may be requisite , & you , by continuing to take what might be have been beneficial a month ago , you are , perhaps doing yourself great injury . -- I am likewise very much concerned for Sir Robt . Gunning -- & sincerely glad Dr Jebb attends him , though the Physician from R . might be a skilful man , he ha d s not ye . same chance of being of service to him , Dr Jebb , on the contrary , by knowing his constitution can prescribe with greater certainty . I hope my Dear to have a few lines from you without fail , by return of post -- Mrs . Fielding , to the 14 ) great happineſs of the proud Parent , was safely brought to bed of a Son on the 31 st . . Lady Charlotte had an expreſs with this most welcome intelligence , Mrs . Fielding never was so well before , my most dear & amiable friend Lady Dartrey , & her Mrs Fielding s worthy Aunt Lady Louisa Clayton were with her at the time , & the latter is to be with her till she is recovered . Lady Charlotte Finch has been very anxious about her favorite Daughter & , entre nous , thought it no small hardship that she was not excused by her Majesty attending the Princeſs Elizabeth , & c to Eastbourne , & though I so very highly respect & love Lady Charlotte Finch , I must say I think as she enjoys such great pecuniary advantages & for herself , & family , from the King & Queen , & has been so greatly considered , it is to be regretted she does not exert herself more for the advantage of the Royal children , & c & c. You will rejoice for me when I inform you my friends Lord & Lady Dartrey are arrived at East-bourne , as there will not be any impropriety in their visiting their Royal Highneſs 's , & joining our parties , I shall have the heart felt comfort of seeing them often -- I hope I shall be able to persuade them to remain as long as we shall -- They have their sweet Girl with them ( 15 I had a most gracious & affectionate little letter from the Queen on Saturday , she tells me it is the last before we shall m e et , -- that she wrote it in my room , & reminds me of sitting with me there last year -- The Princeſs Royal & Miſs Goldsworthy have had an open rupture ( this must be sacred ) I think them both to blame -- Miſs Goldsworthy is most praiseworthy and indefatigable in the duties of her station , but she wants softneſs of temper & manner -- nor do I think her either qualified by education or Birth to be Subgoverness to the Daughter of a Monarch . -- I have a most sincere affection for her , not withstanding -- & flatter myself she regards me equally . Mr. Edwin Stanhope -- my perpetual torment , has taken it into his strange pate to send me such a Volume of incomprehensible jargon -- five pages of Verse , & as much in prose , we will laugh over it when we meet -- I never answer his letters , & very often do not read them havg many packets by me unsealed . Adieu the wind blows my paper about -- & my Dear Children wish me to play wth- them -- I have scribbled so rapidly I fear you can can hardly decypher what I have written . Ever the same towards you Mary Hamilton Remember me kindly to Sr. Robert -- Your Br . & Sister . 16 ) 18 th . Septr . 1780 Eastbourne I am grateful for the scrap you sent me my friend , God grant you may soon be enabled to write longer letters -- I hear Miſs Tryon is ill , & suffers much -- I trust your resentment is softened , for though you might be offended , your superiour sense & the uncommon advantages of education for a female wch your Father gave you , ought to raise your ideas above such miserable trifles . I think her Majesty will never be brought to Bed -- no account from Windsor to day . A shocking & most awful event happened yesterday -- My nerves are still too much agitated for me to give you any regular acct . -- A Thunder storm , 2 persons were killed by Lig h t tning Lightning , & a 3 d . much wounded , It was miraculous from the situation of our House that we escaped -- those also that Prince Edward , & Lady Charlotte Finch occupied was were in the direct line Adieu the Post waits -- Your true Friend Mary Hamilton 7 th . Septr .. 1780 -- —— writes to me that the Ducheſs of Argyle & her Daughter Lady Augusta are constant in their attendance on Windsor Terrace , which I much wonder at , as her Majesty does not invite them them to her Evening parties -- surely this must be particulary mortifying to the Ducheſs -- I must own , in confidence to you , I do not think the Queen to blame , as the Dſs . 's manners towards her ( 17 her -- ( I grieve to sa y it , for she has invariably been attentive & kind -- & I may say , affectionate , to me wch . she said she owed , whenever I expreſsed my acknowledgments , for my Father 's amiable interference in persuading his Cousin The Duke of Hamilton to marry her -- of wch . she has repeatedly told me the whole history ) this is a long par enthesis I repeat I grieve to say the Dſs . of A : manners towards the Queen wch . I have been too often witneſs to , has been provokingly haughty , not to acknowledge , most improperly & unprovokedly insolent . Adieu , my Dear , I have many other letters to write -- Yours in true confidence , & Sincerity Mary Hamilton East Bourne 15 th June 1780 Our journey was very pleasant , the weather fine , the Roads good , & the views beautiful , particularly from East Grinstead to Ukfield , from whence the prospect was more confined but the Fields were covered with charming Verdure bounded by luxuriant Hedge-rows -- abt . 10 Miles from East-bourne it is barren flat , & dreary . Nothing could exceed the loyalty of the people , This circumstance after the recent melancholy confusion & uproar in the Capital was particularly pleasing , & of course , highly gratifying to their Royal Highneſs 's . every Town & Village through wch . we paſsed shewed testimony of respect & attention -- Bells ringing -- firing & c & c & the roads lined with people , who strewed flowers & rushes , & flung Nosegays into the Carriages , when we alighted at an Inn we were covered with the flowers which the poor Women showerd over us -- Prince Edward s Governor Mr Bruyeres rewarded them by throwing Silver -- & he gave money at the Towns & Villages for the Bell ringers -- & c abt 7 Miles from this place a large party of Men on Horseback , some with their Wives & Daughters behind them met the Royal Children & after giving them 3 Chears turned their Horses & escorted them to this Habitation , wch . was surrounded by all the people of the neighbouring Villages -- The Sailors on ye . Beach fired Cannon at intervals the whole Eveg . . A large Cask of strong Beer was placed there by Mr. Bruyeres orders & was emptied to the ( 19 the Healths of the King & Royal Family -- all this was very cheering to ones spirits after the horrid transactions in London . The reconciliation of the King to the Dukes of Gloucester & Cumberland is now made public , they were introduced on Tuesday to the Princes & Princeſs 's with the restriction that their Royal Highneſs 's were not to enquire after the Ducheſs 's of Gloucester or Cumberland -- They are to be at the Drawing room to day , & the Elder Princes are to meet them .

Mrs : Fielding writes word Lord E . has been laughed out of his intention , of 20/ marrying L MW . by his gay companions reminding him of his former declarions declarations never to marry -- Lady Egermont will be hurt , for she told the Queen how happy & pleased she was wth . the intended match & that her Son would marry . Adieu my Dr . MH East Bourne 17 th . August 1780 Mr. B.Budé has written you a Note which I inclose -- he read it to me -- he is not amiable but he imagines I am the dupe to his external appearance -- Mr : Fisher & Mr : Farhill are very ill treated by him , so are all Prince Edward s Domestic 's , he is quite hated by them & I fear deservedly so . I want you to apply to your Father in my name for the relief of a poor Widow Gentlewoman , I am raising a subscription -- your F . desired I would never would scruple applying to him for objects of real distreſs -- when we meet , if he wished it , I will tell him her name . It is sufficient for the present to inform him her Husband was a Clergyman , he died abt . a Month ago , & left an amiable beautiful Wife with 6 Children -- from a variety of circumstances , chiefly I am told illneſs they had been sometime deeply involved in debt . The Creditors are now in poſseſsion of all she has , this stroke added to the loſs of an affectionate Husband has overwhelmd her . I leave it to you my Dr . friend to plead for my poor Widow .

I am pre-resolved to shew this poor Dutch Woman every attention -- for though I am very certain the Queen will be most kind , gracious & generous towards her , I well know others will slight her , or , at least , shew her moon shine civility . Adieu my Dr . frd . Mary Hamilton Queens Lodge Windsor 25 th Novbr . 1781 My Dear -- we go to Town tomorrow The family to settle for the Winter -- Her Majesty & the Princeſs Royal & myself return on Friday to this place to attend his Majesti es hunting party These excursions for some time , are to be from Friday ti ll Monday . I have great delight in looking forward to your return , if you keep your word , & arrive the 6 th .

Mary Hamilton 26/ Queens Lodge Windsor 14 th Jan 1782 -- I suffered many hours of anxiety on your acct . my Dr . frd . wch . I certainly might have been spared had your letter been given to the post the night it was written , for though you did not date your letter I imagine it was written on Friday night , for you had so seriously promised I should hear from you , & I did not till yesterday -- I can not tell you what uneasineſs I suffered on Saturday , particularly too as no post went form hence that day & I could not contrive , even to send a meſsenger , to enquire after you , I hope & trust you have seen my friend Doctr . Turton . I can not place any faith in ye . skill of the person you told me of -- You aſsure me you feel “ rather better upon the whole ” -- I will hope you neither deceive me nay yourself . -- The King has had a Cold & her Majesty is not free from one , therefore I do not imagine they will venture either to the Play or Opera before the Great Drawing Room . The Queen enquired after your health . We have had a most melancholy gloom cast over our whole party , indeed my spirits have been so much affected that I do not expect to get the better of it for some time -- I have not leisure to enter into any detail -- Doctr . Arnold who this day week was under this Roof in perfect health & good spirits is now in the most deplorable of all situations , -- confined as a lunatic & raving Mad ! Adieu My Dr . Ever most Affy . Your frd . Mary Hamilton ( 27 From Sr. Wm . Wake s Eſ U pshire Farm Eſsex 26 th . Sepbr . 1783 My Dr . frd . I do not imagine I shall have the happineſs of seeing you for some time , unleſs you could go to Courteenhall -- this requires explanation -- Sir Wm- Wake has proposed that Lady Wake should pay a visit to her Father & Mother in Yorkshire , & my amiable friend has entreated me to go with her , & Mr & Mrs. Fenton have kindly invited me to their house -- if we go we shall stop one day night at Courteenhall & I will take care to inform you when I am to be there -- Sir Wm . has busineſs wch will detain him in Eſsex , therefore our party will consist of Lady Wake , her eldest Son , his Tutor & myself -- we shall stay a Month , I believe at Mr- Fenton 's -- Sr. Wm . left us on Sunday to attend Northampton Races & c he is expected back to day . I hope he will bring good accts . of Sr. Robert , & that his Domestics & Neighbours are recovered from ye- late epidemic disorder . -- I am writing to you in ye . Garden -- not seated in a “ Proud Alcove ” or Gothic Temple but in a little humble shed -- how I wish you were with me -- but yet I rejoice that you are at this time gratifying the wish of your heart in hastening on to a beloved Father -- I am delighted you have so fine a day for your Journey -- Yesterday the weather was agreeably pleasant & Dr . Ly . Wake endulged me in a scheme I proposed that we should all dine in the Forest -- we spent a most agreeable day . -- pray say many civil things for me to your Brother & aſsure him I am very sorry he is so angry wth . me -- had it been in my power I certainly would have spent some time at Horton -- Adieu I shall write again in a day or two my love to Bell , Compts . to Sr. Robert . 28 ) Bullstrode Decbr . 9 th . 1783 I told you my Dear I would acquaint you why I prolonged my stay with the Dr. Ducheſs of Portland tho ' I earnestly wishd to see you . The Ducheſs and Mrs. Delany so warmly & affectionately preſsed me to continue with them till they went to Town that it was hardly im poſsible to refuse , but Mrs. Delany being for three days extremely ill made me no longer hesitate -- These two Dear friends wanted the attention & friendly aſsistance of a third person to keep up their spirits , & I flatter myself my endeavours had that effect -- it was very touching to observe their tender solicitude for each other -- Mrs. Delany exerting herself to appear better than she was , not to alarm the Ducheſs , & the Dſs- using every effort of her reason to conceal from Mrs- Delany her anxiety ; she is now pretty well again , & indeed in surprising health as in leſs than a Month she will be 84 -- her birth dates wth . ye year -- Her faculties are not the least impaired -- her sight only excepted wch . has been failing sometime , yet she reads , & writes as well as ever , & employs herself in various works -- The vigor of her mind -- the activity of her limbs , & the sensibility of her heart are the same as when she was young . I have so great a n veneration & love for this most excellent of women that I could talk of her without ceasing -- I am every day more charmed with her , & I think myself very fortunate in having had opportunities of benifiting by the contemplation of such rare human perfection , & receiving instruction by listening to precepts which I trust will ever be engraven on my mind . I am sorry my Dear to hear that Dowgr Lady Carslisle is returned to England as I imagine it ( 29 it will make you lose many pleasant hours at Carlisle House -- for you certainly will endeavour to avoid the society of a Woman who has been so infamous , & , as Lord Carslisle , it is said , has shewn her great kindneſs , it is probable she will be much at his house . 10 Decbr . I had intended sendg . you a long letter as I have a thousand things to say to you , but Dr- Mrs. Delany has taken up my time & she has not been so well to day , she had an indifferent night & has had a bad head ach , I have just attended her to her apartment -- it is ten o'Clock , supper just ready & my Dear Ducheſs will wait for me -- If you have no franks send your letters to WhiteHall . Lady Weymouth left us yesterday , she had been here three days -- My Uncle Sir Wm : Hamilton was to have come here again next Saturday -- but he has written to inform me that his Majesty has done him the honor to invite him to Windsor for two or 3 days -- I believe I shall be in Town the 18 -- tell me all your plans Adieu my Dr . ever Yours Mary Hamilton This date can not be correct for it would make Mrs Delaney 103 years old she died 15 April 1788 19 th . Janry 1803 -- Mrs. G.Glover under ye . most unpromising exterior poſseſses every good quality of the heart , her principles are founded on rectitude and she is the warmest & most steady friend I ever met with -- to esteem her as she deserves one must have more opportunities of knowing her than that of a mere acquaintance , & her manners & language are destitute of that polish wch . are requisite in that society to which her Husband belongs , & wch . she , from her Birth , tho ' not from her education , has a right to be in 30 ) to be in . Mr : Farhill called on me this Morng -- & brought me a poem wch . he has written , & had printed a Dozen Copies printed of for the gratification of his friends , who requested him to do so -- it is an imitation of one of Juvenals Satires -- the title of it is Nobility we will read it together . I sat an Hour with Mrs- Delany this morng -- she was very well & in charming spirits -- Mr. Bryant came in & we had a pleasant chat -- Mrs. D enquired after you & expreſsed much concern that you had been so ill . I dined at Mr. Jackson 's & was much entertained by the prattle of Beau Tutteridge who was one of the Guests -- had I my dr . little Burney 's talents I could amuse you by a description of this good natured coxcombical being . He boasted to me that he was the Original from whom his Royal Highneſs the Prince of Wales , & heir apparent of the Crown of England copied , viz his Buckles , snuff boxes & so forth -- but the Prince unfortunately does not have his hair dreſsed in the same stile as Tutteridge 's , therefore he condemns it as very outre & unbecoming . I return 'd to my old Friend Leonidas immediately after dinner as I had promised , & read aloud to him the whole Eveg . . I read a Manuscript Comedy wch . he wrote 30 years ago -- the only comedy he ever wrote -- The Story is taken from ye . Arabian nights Entertainments & ye . Persian Tales -- it is very entertaining & very moral -- interesting also , but not a single dash of ye . sentimental -- he wrote it in 16 days & though -- it has never been corrected it might go to the Preſs . ( 31 1 st - July 1784 Clarges Street My Dear friend I do not wish to pry into any secret you do not think proper to communicate , all I require is the continuance of the affection you say you have for me -- I have the highest opinion of your understanding & well know how inferior I am in judgment to you . -- I am extremely apprehensive that I shall not be able to visit you at your Father s this Summer -- my Uncle Sir Wm . Hamilton has engaged me to execute so many commiſsions for him that I see no end to ym- if you was but 10 or 12 Miles from Town I could easily go to you , because I could return when it was neceſsary -- one of the commiſsion is to superintend the progreſs of a n Drawg & engraving by Cipriani of the fine Antique Vase . 2 d . July Friday -- Lady Clavering has just left me , she told me you had invited her to spend a day at Horton on her way to the North , she is waiting for Mrs. Peachel s being brought to bed wch . she hourly expects , & after ye : 3 d . or 4 th . day after that event she intends to set out -- now if there is any posſibility of getting my Uncle s busineſs in a certain train , for I know it can not be finished , I shall certainly accompany her & stay with you as long as I can -- I have settled this with Lady Clavering & you must inform me where you intend to meet us in your Father s carriage , & when & where the Coach sets out that your Servants always go in -- I shall send her maid by that conveyance 32/ conveyance -- ( I shall not take one as yours or Bell s can dreſs my Hair ) as I am to take her place in Lady C . Chaise -- a Miſs Goring is to accompany Lady C . -- we shall travel with post horses . My mind is quite set in this scheme -- yet I own I have my fears I shall not be able to manage it If I did not love my Uncle Wm so well -- I could almost be out of humor with him , he might have thought it could not be agreeable to me to be forced to stay in Town & set aside all my Summer engagements & disappoint so many of my friends If he was in London & I had the pleasure of his society I should be made amends , but he is rambling over the Hills & far away I was my dear quite affected with your narrative of the little Boy Sir Robert has so benevolently taken under his protection . I am astonished to hear that Mr. Thursby has acted so inconsiderately as to leave his eldest Daughter to her own Guidance at Freestone . -- Lady Wake informs me she dined lately at Abington , there was a large party & Miſs Thursby acquitted herself very well ; I am sorry you will not have an opportunity of seeing her this Summer as I am much interested abt . her both for her own & her late mother s sake , & I had hoped she would reap great advantage by forming an acquaintance with you & Isabella . I suppose you have heard of the death of that vile Woman the Dowg . Lady Harrington , what a dreadful end to an infamous life ! perhaps you ( 33 you have not heard the following particulars 33 concerning her wch . I will relate as I can depend on ye . person who informed me -- Lady Harrington was perfectly well & in high spirits the whole day , was out all Morning & dined with her friend Mrs. Abington , the Actreſs , when she returned home in the Eveg she found some cause of displeasure against her Porter and fell into a dreadful paſsion -- the man saw her stagger & thought she was going to fall -- he caught her in his arms , the miserable wretch was struck wth- death , all she said after the Porter had placed her in his Chair , was , “ dont leave me , ” she remained there two hours -- The Apothecary found her a melancholy object , her tongue hanging quite out of her mouth & black , she lay insensible till 4 in the morning and then died -- what is very surprising no one has yet taken upon them to give any order respecting the Body -- her Servants sent for a Shell in wch- they have placed the Corpse wch . is dreſsed in White Sattin & a lace Mob cap , & every one who chuses is admitted to see her -- I have heard of several Young Men of the Haut-Ton who have been to look on this awful spectacle -- God Grant it may excite some profitable and lasting impreſsions on their minds -- Genl . Craggs was with her when she breathed her last & he is too deeply afflicted 34/ to give any orders , & they say that is also the reason why her Executor Sir Alexander Crawford has not yet acted -- What a striking leſson might this event be to the vicious , & to those who do not strive to check their paſsions -- how dreadful the thought that a human creature should thus unprepared , & unrepenting rush into an awful eternity ! I have been told that whenever this unhappy creature was ill , she used , in transports of despair to say -- I can not die ” -- “ I wont die ” -- enough & too much on this melancholy subject -- The Prince of Wales is ill again , he went yesterday to the Queen to make an apology for not attending the Drawing room as he was indisposed , & he had so great an opp r eſsion on his breath that he could not speak , this my worthy friend Mr. Digby told me . The Ducheſs of Hamilton is so ill that Sir Peter Burrel & her Mother are gone expreſs to Scotland -- the Duke is drinking himself to death as fast as poſsible I am now much taken up with my Cousin Ly . Stormont who is come to Town to l a y in Lord Stormont s always joins us in the Eveg . & I find this this very pleasant , Adieu ton chere Amie ! Mry Hamilton ( 35 ) Monday 12 th . July 1804 Clarges Street You will my dearest very easily comprehend how much I am mortified & disappointed , & you too , to my great concern will I know be equally so ! -- for I am obliged to tell you that I can not accompany Lady Clavering tomorrow & I also greatly fear I shall not be able to Visit you at Horton this Summer -- I will however still hope when you go there between the fortnight Drawing Rooms that I can then go with you -- Mrs. Walsingham has sent me a most preſsing invitation to go to her next Sunday . -- I went to her on Saturday at her Villa at Thames Ditton with Mr : Pepys , we got there to dinner & I returned by 11 this Morng . -- , she inquired kindly after you ; -- Yesterday , Mrs. Garrick , the Ducheſs of Bolton , Lady Catherine Pawlet , & Mss . Boyle dined with us -- Mrs. Walsingham 's Son staid all night -- I like him -- ( notwithstanding some reports I have certainly heard to his disadvantage ) -- he appears good humour 'd , sensible , & polite -- I was really very much pleased to observe that Mrs : W : & her Son seemed to be on affectionate terms , he is uncommonly attentive to her -- Miſs Boyle quite adores her Brother , & , he is , I think , fond of her -- it was really a pleasure to see how happy she was to enjoy his society . I have promised Mrs. Walsingham to spend a few days with her very soon again -- as I can run down to her in the intervals of the great affairs I am concerned in for my Uncle William . People may say what they please , & you , even you , but I have ever found Mrs : Walsingham steady , sincere , & consistent , towards myself -- & I should be very un- 36/ ungrateful indeed if I did not acknowle g d ge it to every one who chuses to abuse her -- I will , some other time give you what , I think , her true character , there may be , & I fear is , some austerity , but how few are her equals in strength of mind , & mental acquirements . & c , & I can with truth maintain she is truly religious , & not devoid of benevolence , wch . many aſsert , for she has insisted upon my acquainting her with any object deserving of relief wch . I might feel interested for , -- & was seriously displeased I had not applied to her for a poor Woman & her Daughter whom she heard I was anxious about -- & without my asking , gave me something very handsome for the poor distreſsed creatures . The Ducheſs of Argyle has resigned her place as Lady of ye . Bedchamber to her Majesty wch- was I am told , accepted without any expreſsions of regret -- Lady Harcourt succeeds her , and is delighted with the distinguished honor she has received by the appointment . I shall spend the whole day tomorrow with Lord & Lady Stormont , if I am not obliged to stay at home , -- on Wednesday Morning I am to have Sir Wm . Hamilton 's people with me -- then go to Lord Dartrey 's at Chelsea to dine , & return on Thursday Morng -- I have written in the greatest haste having a thousand things to do at once . & a quantity of letters to answer Heaven give you health & protect you my dr . frd . Mary Hamilton ( 37 23 d . August 1784 Clarges Street My dear -- If I had not been disappointed in seeing my , delight , of a Cousin Charles Cathcart I should have written to you on Saturday Evening -- I got a bad cold by walking home instead of having my Chair , by wch . my feet got wet -- O how I lament my poor dear Parents brought me up to be a fine Lady . -- I saw Coll . Cathcart last night , he desired me to tell you aſsure you that his friend & yours was well , as he had lately heard from him ; he would not advise you to write , as it was so uncertain if any letters would reach him . Coll . Cathcart has promised to give me further information before he goes to Scotland , wch . will be in a few days ; he spoke very highly of Mr. Young , & said he had often heard him speak of your family in terms of of gratitude & sincere affection . Mr. Young is now at Madrás & my Cousin told me that he believed his deteremination respecting his continuance in the regiment would be by what he did . I hope my Dear I may be able in a day or two to give you a more satisfactory account I must conclude , Ever tenderly Yours Mry Hamilton Enclose to Viscount Stormont Portland place . 20 th - Sepbr- 1804 Harwood Sunbury Middlesex My Dearest I came here last Sunday & am engaged to remain till next Monday , when I go to Lord Stormont 's at Wandsworth Hill for a week , after that I go to my two Dear Old friends at Bullstrode where I shall make a long Stay , -- I recd a letter from my amiable friend Lady Wake who is at Sir Wm- s Riddlesworth Hall Norfolk she desires me to look out for a Governeſs for her Daughters , I 38 ) I thought my Dear that you had got one for them -- pray write to me immediately -- I have recd . a letter from Madame Busche she makes me many apologies and entreats the continuance of my friendship & c & c -- The worthy Genl . Freytag whom I made my confidant i f n this strange & unexpected conduct of hers , has cleared up the mystery , but under promise of my not repeating what he told me so I shall not , even to you -- Let me hear very particulary how you do & if you have lost the pain in your Hip -- I wish you wd . inform me of what you are doing , & sometimes of what you think -- if you should be so graciously inclined enclose your Packets to Viscount Stormont Wandsworth Hill , & he will forward them in case I am gone frm . thence to the Dſs- -- Dog of Portland s -- This is a quiet comfortable place , & I receive great satisfaction in observing that my friend Mrs. Jackson is very happy as a Wife & Mother she has 3 sweet little Girls , & has the means to live in an hospitable & agreeable stile -- Adieu I will my Dearest , write longer letters when I have got rid of ye : cold & inflammation in my Eyes Wandsworth Hill Octbr . 5 th - 1804 You will have been surprised my Dr . frd- not to have heard from me before now , but my Eyes were so bad all the time I was at Harwood that I really had not spirits to write to you & indeed it was not prudent for me to use them more than I could help -- The day I arrived -- wch . was on Tuesday the 28 th - I met Doctr . Ford & he kindly advised me to leave off the eye waters I had been recommended to use , as they were all too strong , & did more harm than good -- he ordered me to put 1 Grain ( or 2 at most ) of White Vitriol in an ounce of Elder flower water , & to Bathe my eyes with this mixture several times a day -- I have done so & refrained much from reading & writing & my ( 39 my eyes are now well -- now you have the recipe , you can prescribe it , to any one who has inflamed Eye lids , for that was my complaint . I recd . your little note at Harwood & your letter after I came here . Mrs. Walsingham has sent me a most kind & friendly invitation to meet you next Saturday at her Villa -- I am very sorry it is not in my power to accept it , but that is the Day I have promised the Ducheſs to be at Bullstrode & as I have already disappointed her by not going 6 weeks ago I can not venture to put off going , tho ' had I not fixt the day I should not have been able to resist spending a few days happily with & Mrs. Walsingham at Thames Ditton . My Uncle William informed me that the Ducheſs of Argyle is ordered by her Physician to spend the Winter at Nice ; when he was with her in Scotland this Summer he thought her looking very ill , & grown extremely weak -- I am truly concerned she in so declining a state -- Lord Stormont will take me to Town on Thursday , & I will call on you before your dinner , for I had rather not dine with you at the Maids of Honor 's table -- & If I dine there I shall offend my Uncle Frederick -- & two or three others -- & I wish to be alone at home a few hours -- I am very sorry I can not receive you in the Eveg . as Mr. Hamilton has sent word he intends coming to sit with me , provided I shall be alone . Mr : Dickenson s father has been dangerously ill & he has not been able to go to London . I hope my Dear that I shall find you free from complaint -- what a general state of suffering as Yours ! Lord Stormont intends taking me & his Daughter tomorrow to see the Duke of Northumberland s fine Villa at Sion -- Adieu ma Belle & chere Amie Dure á jamais notre Amitie ! Mary Hamilton X This mention of Mr Dickenson proves that this letter should be dated 1784 & not 1804 see page 42 40 Bullstrode Park 19 th : Octbr . 1784 I sent you a few lines yesterday my Dear in a frank of Lord Stormont s -- how unfortunate I was not to be able to spend two or three comfortable hours with you as I had depended on doing the day I was in Town . -- surely my Dear aſsurances of friendship from me must be wholly unneceſsary for you will know that my heart is sincerely attached to you -- yet the conclusion of your letter was gratifying to my feelings . I wish you was here with me -- you would be charmed in contemplating the virtues of the two friends -- you would delight on their conversation -- their manners -- & you wld- be much pleased with the stile of living & every thing around you -- here you would find a constant fund of rational & instructive amusements -- & , notwithstanding the advanced age of the Ducheſs & Mrs. Delany you would find constant good humour & chearfulneſs made their society as desirable as their Virtues , good sense , cultivated minds , & knowledge of the world make it equally instructive & entertaining -- I hope your parties took place , I know how agreeable they would be & how much Mr. Walpole & Mrs. Garrick would be pleased to meet you as you are very much admired by both . I have this moment recd . a letter from Lady Wake with the most comfortable acts . of herself & Marianne -- she aſsures me that she has not suffered in health by the anxiety she was under on her Dr . Girl s account who is recovering fast . Sir Wm . also was getting better -- this last fit of the Gout having been leſs violent -- Ly . W . does not mention when they shall leave Riddlesworth Hall -- but this illneſs of Miſs Wake s has put a stop to their going into Yorkshire . 20 th Wednesday -- you ask me how long I shall remain at Bullstrode -- I have promised the Ducheſs to stay with her till Christmas when she settles in Town ( 41 Town for the Winter & she has in ye most friendly manner insisted most that Mr. Dickenson shall make his intended visit to me here -- as to your question when our affairs will draw to a conclusion , I can only tell you I believe our union will not take place for some time , perhaps some Months -- we mutually wish to shew every mark of deference to Mr. D : Senior -- who wishes to arrange & set tle every thing between himself Son & Daughters before we are united . 21 st . Thursday -- Miſs Hannah More writes me word she has lately made an acquaintance with a poor Creature whose whole life has been devoted to the lowest affairs , such as Milking Cows , selling the Milk abt . ye . streets of Bristol , & feeding Swine , to support a miserable existence , & procure food for 6 small Children -- & yet who writes most excellent verses , she has a fine imagination , stored with abundance of images , a great variety of poetical expreſsion , & an ear so finely tuned , that in 500 lines Hannah More was not able to detect an unmusical one -- she has very noble sentiments , & what is infinitely better good principles . She is select in choosing words though she has never seen a Dictionary -- in short this poor Creature is a prodigy -- Miſs H. More has promised to send me some of her Verses , & as I imagine you will have as great a curiosity to see them as myself I will copy them for you . I want to know if you have read Coxe s Tour -- through Poland Ruſsia & c , & how you like it , I am reading it to ye . Dear friends in an Eveg , & have almost got through the first Volume , I like it very well on the whole & He appears an impartial writer .

Could you not contrive to pay me a Morng visit from St. Leonards Hill . Did you see the Dſs . of Argyle when she was in London ? I fear frm . what I have heard that she can not live long -- how did she appear to you ? for I hope you did see her Ever yor . friend Mry : Hamilton 42 . Some of these letters , which are evidently copies of the originals , & apparently in the handwriting of M rs John Dickenson ( née Mary Hamilton ) are dated 1803 and 1804 . But as they are signed Mary Hamilton , & she married Mr Dickenson ( to whom she became engaged on 18 th June 1784 ) on 13 th June 1785 This must be incorrect & the proper dates are probably 1783 and 1784 and the se date 183 or 1804 may be the date on which the letters were copied Besides , in one of the letters , dated 1804 , reference is made to Mrs Delany who was born in 1700 & died on 15 th April 1788 .
