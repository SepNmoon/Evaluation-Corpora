Wandsworth hill Augst . 27 th - A thousand thanks my dear Miſs Hamilton for your kind Letter I have the pleasure to tell you that our dear Lady Stormont goes on vastly well she has been up for a little while these two last days & continues nursing her Boy who is in perfect health -- she begs the favor of you to present her duty to the Queen with many thanks to her Majesty for so graciously enquiring after her -- I aſsure you she is very prudent & takes great care of herself -- I do n't think if she was otherwise that I could be any check upon her for I dont believe she has so great an opinion of my matronly care as my good friends at Windsor -- I am highly flattered by all the civil things contained in your Letter and Postcript concerning me , & only wish I deserved them -- I aſsure you , you may be quite easy about Lady Stormont for she is amazingly well & so tractable that she readily submits to every thing Nurse Hill orders -- Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton accept the sincere good wishes of all your friends at Wandsworth -- & believe me yr . very affecte . Elizath . M. Murray Be so good to present my Compts . to Coll . Greville and tell him I had a letter yesterday from Ly . Frances Harpur who says she intends coming to Town in about a fortnight in her way to Margate --
