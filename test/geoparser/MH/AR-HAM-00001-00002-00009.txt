Loughboro ' Sunday Evg 19 -- March 1786 Now my dearest Wife I begin another journal -- but this will be dull & uninteresting -- as I shall have little else than mere Matter of fact to write about , and but a small variation of that -- You my Love have a warm interest in every thing that concerns your Husband , and therefore trifles will not be unacceptable to you -- Your excellent heart will inform you much better than I can , how much concern I feel at any Separation from the woman I so sincerely love & esteem -- but I hope yr D—— will he is going to London to see Mrs. Racket his Wife who has got a Feveret -- poor dear Mrs. Delany how I pity her -- She will be sadly tormented by that Madcap -- Dr- Heberden has been call 'd in , so I suppose the Complaint was rather more than a Vagar y i e -- I sent a Meſsage to Mrs. Delany I jogged on thro dirty roads and over hard pavements to this place , where I hope to sleep , but I am forty nine Miles from my dear Mary -- Oh how I miſs your charming Saucineſses -- dont you sometimes wish for me at yr- Elbow -- I shd . be very happy to be there -- Adieu ma tres tres chere femme Je vous aime avec tout mon cœur -- bon soir mon Amour
