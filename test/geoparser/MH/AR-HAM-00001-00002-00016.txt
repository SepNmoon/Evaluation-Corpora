Sunday Evg -- 11 oClock 21 June 89 I was quite ashamed of the Letter which I wrote to you on Friday , for on looking it over , there appeared to be a mistake or a word left out in every line -- it was written in haste & there was not time to send you a better -- a thousand things were omitted as I would not delay a post to inform my dearest Mary of my arrival at this place -- That Mr Wilmot told me that Lord W . had proposed to the town of W—— two members in opposition to his brother and Mr. L—— Lord Arden & Mr. Gage nephew to Lord Gage & great interest was now making to secure their election -- As I told you before I spent a most agreeable day with the More 's -- and my astonishment was great to hear them make use of so many vulgar expreſsions in common conversation -- I shd . think their Reading & Hannah 's observation would have cleared that Rubish from such pleasure grounds -- Sally has a lively imagination -- but she rises into the third Heaven too often -- she is an agreeable woman notwithstanding -- The Housekeeper Betty has a notion of old English hospitality -- for she loaded my plate so often that I was ready to fight rather than burst -- They shewed me some drawings of a young woman that they had educated , which was very beautiful She is now a Governeſs or rather an Usher at a School -- She came to them at first in the capacity of a Maid of all work for 50 s / a year wages -- The young Ladies finding that she was ingenious , set her copies & taught her to write some instructed in one thing & some in another & She made such wonderful improvements that Miſs Mores thought she deserved to have every advantage -- She was therefore taught every thing that might be useful to her -- She writes an uncommon fine hand , draws well , dances , understands needle work & c. & c. & to crown their generous intentions -- is very grateful -- Mrs. Yearsley is universally despised -- there are only three or 4 people who take any notice of her -- in speaking of her , I said that in my opinion Miſs H. M . ought to have taken notice of that woman 's justification of herself , as it was too well written to be treated with contempt , however fallacious She might know the subject to be -- Miſs Mores said , they had always been of my Opinion , but Hannah thought otherwise -- Sally was of opinion that ten Lines would be sufficient ( just of facts ) to convince the world of the injustice of the accusations , to clear up Hannah 's character to the World , & expose the notorious falsehoods in Mrs. Y . s publication -- They spoke with great affection of Dr. Stonehouse who now resides at the Hot Wells , his health is so indifferent that he has given up his Duty in ye- Country -- he was vastly pleased with Hannah 's Elegy on his excellent Wife Clara 's Husband is dying of a loathsome lingering disease -- She all Ease & Gaiety -- I am to spend a day or two with the Mores at Cowslip Green & shall pay a visit to Dr. Stonehouse -- Monday morng 6 oClock I wrote the other page last Night & thanks to my Candle could go no farther -- I have been reading for an hour and half a pamphlet called The Royal Interview , a very masterly performance & very scarce it supposes a Conversation paſsed between the K & P of W in which the K . points out the impropriety of the P 's conduct & ye- glorious oppy which he has lost of becoming the Idol of the British Nation of attoneing for all his follies & being admired & respected by all the World -- I am now enjoying myself in the only way in wch . I converse with my dear Mary -- you see I dont keep very bad hours -- I meant to have bathed this morning but it rains so hard that I shall defer it -- I will now go to the Pump room & when the Water is comfortably settled in my Stomach I will resume my Journal -- First I ought to tell you that Mrs Rundell & c made a thousand friendly enquiries about you & Louisa -- Miſs R . is very tall I am afraid she will be 6 feet without her Shoes -- Fanny is grown thin & tall Margaret at School -- I shall not go there too often -- & I hope they wont force me to dine there -- tho I have been asked -- Sally Nicolls wished me to live with her -- as she has room enough in a very good house & in a pleasant situation -- She talks of leaving Bath in ten days -- when I put ye- Letter for you in the Post Office I found one there from Jacson -- very friendly -- expreſsing a concern for the neceſsity of my coming to Bath , giving me a kind invitation to Richmond if change of air was neceſsary -- also a literal answer to my questions -- disapproving of the Ton line & speaking of Dear Nanny s versatility in a manner that gives me concern as I see he never will forgive her leaving us last summer I have answered his Letter -- Friday -- I dined at my Lodgings -- Our dame Keeps an excellent Table She is a Gentlewoman -- her Husband , a wine Merchant -- they are civil obliging and attentive -- I give a Guinea a week for Breakfast & Dinner & Supper & Tea in the afternoon if I choose it -- & 7/6 for my Bed Room , wch . is a large one -- I drank tea at the Rundell 's -- called on the Earle 's who are just returned from Cheltenham -- They seemed a little hurt that your Ladyship had not wrote to them -- I made a tolerable apology , aſsuring Mrs E . that I knew you had a very great Esteem for her , but that you did not know that she wished to keep up a constant correspondence -- that you have a great many correspondents wh . took up a great deal of yr- time & the attention you paid to Louisa prevented your writing to many of yr- friends & c & c -- they seemed very glad to see me & invited me to dine with them en famille on the 21 st -- I call 'd on Mr. Herschell Frere du Philosophe , & fixed with him about my learning to play upon the violincello -- he is esteemed a good master -- I staid an hour with him & he shewed me the Method of polishing Mirrors , he makes Telescopes & is going to make one to look at the Georgium Sidus his Bror . is making one that will be 40 feet long & 5 feet in Diameter -- when the mirror broke which the Philosopher had been polishing for 14 days & nights -- he only said “ well we must set about another -- but I will have some tea first ” -- 20 -- Made my Coup d'eſsai on the violincello & have some hopes -- he has promised to be very honest with me & tell me if I am likely to succeed -- in case of fair prospects -- the purchase of an Instrument will require cash my sweet friend -- Called on the Rundells , & I am very sorry to inform you that Mrs. R . says there are not the least hopes of Miſs Foote -- I called on Miſs Milnes when , to my great astonishment , I found Sally Nicolls quite at home -- after paſsing an hour a mon gré I went to the Isted 's where I had a very awkward reception -- I could not prevail upon a little black Boy to announce my Name -- two people stood staring at me in the paſsage and as I entered the Room a Lady came out attended by Miſs Isted who took no Notice of me -- I was obliged to walk up to the end of the room to the old Lady who turned up her Spectacles saying 'who is it ! who is it ' -- in a little time Miſs returned & was comfortably vulgar , sported a little Northamptonshire wit on the fineneſs of my complexion & concluded by a preſsing invitation to dine there “ which must be more agreeable to me than a Lodgg house ” -- tho ' it might appear so to her -- I declined the Honor -- Good God ! what a difference Manners make in a human Being -- how bewitching is Elegance and an unaffected attention & how disgusting is Vulgarity -- ! 21 -- I did not bathe , but drank the Waters -- I shd . have concluded yesterday by saying that I left my home at the Vanbrugh 's are not you sorry for them ? Mr. V . I hear bears his loſs with great composure -- Mrs. V—— 's Nerves were more than usually agitated -- you know she is always very figitty . You will have seen Accts . of the fire at the Opera house , from they had 12,000 -- P r . An . -- I went to the Abbey Church , and called at S. Nicoll 's -- Mr. Earle , Mr. Rundell , Mrs Holroyd 's Cards I found at my return -- at 4 I went to the Earles where I dined en famille with very little additions and spent a very agreeable day -- pray tell my Father it has poured a deluge to day -- that it rains almost every hour & setting aside climate I believe there falls as much rain here as at Buxton -- the few fields of graſs that are cut look in a sad condition -- I have only seen two that were cleared , which were in Worcester . All sorts of Garden stuff is in the highest perfection here -- We have in this house several officers -- a Mr. Cox an Irishman a very gentlemanlike man -- we have also two West -- -- Indians -- the wildest of human beings -- indiscreet thoughtless , good humoured , inexhaustible Spirits hard drinkers , irreligious , & c & c & c & c 's -- without End -- you would be exceſsively grieved to hear all that is said of yr- friend Ton . p—— Ah my dearest Love , what will become of this unfortunate Country -- at Bootles a certain person said he wd . be drunk that night , on acct . of York 's safety upon wch . great numbers followed into a room set apart for royal topers -- some climbed on benches , some on tables to see & hear what paſsed . -- when the P . said he w . give a Toast a solemn silence prevailed -- & the followg words were uttered by the Heir to the Throne -- “ Here 's to all our Friends , and Damnation to those Relations who dont love their families ” this was a dutiful compliment to his Mother -- as to the meſsage alluded in the Letter wch . we read together in the papers -- it was too unmanly , too infamous & too obscene for me to write to you -- the basest mind , & the most corrupted heart must combine to invent any thing so horrible to one 's feelings -- & without any provocation but the Gentm . being a Friend of Mr. Pitt -- it is the general wish of the army that the Ball had gone thrō the D—— of Y—— 's head or his heart -- 22 . I called upon Miſs Nicholls & Mrs .. Hockiss who resides in Bath -- and drank the Water , but did not bathe as the morning was so wet -- Spent the day at home -- our Madcaps who have been at Bristol for a few days are returned & keep us all alive . -- 23 -- Bathed this morning -- we have a very high wind , but is fair -- at one I drank the Waters & am going out to make visits -- Scraping goes on very well -- My bleſsing to Louisa , Duty & love & c where proper -- Adieu ma inestimable femme -- Je suis toujours le Même J.
