Edinburgh 29 th . Decemr- 1779 I must begin , My Dear Sister , by telling you that the affair of Miſs L . was settled a Week ago , Not to my satisfaction . She approved of the Method taken & said it was what She would have wished -- sensible of the Merit of the Party -- but the thing was impoſsible , & begged that no further Notice of it might be taken on either Sides . When we meet perhaps I may talk more fully upon upon the subject , than I should chuse to put upon paper -- indeed the theme is not the most agreable I could fix upon -- The footing you are upon with your Uncle Frederick pleases me much . I hope he has done you the utmost justice , if not he deserves to be flogged . I do not think Old Ly- Cathcart means anything by her enquiries . Perhaps it was intended as a reproof to Ly- S—— for not paying her proper attention . I generally write to her once in three Months . The Atholl 's treated us so cavalierly , en paſsant , that I do not propose calling for them , should my duty bring m y e to London this Winter . They did not so much as send a Servant to enquire after Us . They 'll find me as Saucy as they can be Ly- S—— could not poſsibly comment upon my Answer . It was wrote with Spirit , I wo'nt allow it to be called Saucy , and it was true , a word You people about Court hardly know the meaning of . Nothing is yet settled as to the time of my Departure . I expect orders every post . My Company consists of only ten persons , including Serjts- Corporals & Drummers & Private s . Great Marlow , Bucks , is the Town , where they are at present stationed . Sir A. Oughton is in England , but you do not mention his having been at Court . I fear from that circumstance , his health is not such as I could wish . Adieu . No more Apologies , but write when convenient , without being upon Ceremony . I can write no more , the first part of my letter having renewed Ideas , I should wish to forget -- Poor Lord DeLawarr . I am really concerned for him . Yours Affectionately . N——
