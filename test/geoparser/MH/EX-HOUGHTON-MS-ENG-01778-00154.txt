Bristol 2 Nov : 84 My dear Friend Will the excellent Ducheſs dear Mrs. Delany , and Yourself , forgive me for not instantly obeying Your commands in sending some Verses of my poor Poeteſs ? I staid out a w eek longer than I design 'd , of course did not get Your letter in time . The more I see of this Heaven-taught Genius the more I am charmed a nd astonished with her . It is with grief I perceive that her bitter sorrows have tinged her Soul with melancholy ; the terrible circumstance of seeing a beloved Mother die of hunger is ever before h er Eyes , and her Verses continually allude to i t -- My present plan is , if Heaven bleſses my endeavours , to put her into a small Farm ; she implores not to be put into any employment which must make her mix with the World , and rob her of her beloved Solitude . I have no wish to make her an idle or a useleſs Being ; she has duties to fill the smallest of which is of more importance in the Eyes of Heaven than the best Couplet that ever Dryden made . One day I found her in a state of despondency I expostulated on the sinfulneſs of it ; soon after she sent me a long Poem , the conclusion I which I send you without any Alteration -- To Stella -- “ Believe me , gentle friend , I cou 'd complain ; “ But what avails the deep repining Sigh ? “ When Heav'n afflicts none shou 'd oppose the Plea , “ For who shall hold the Arm that thus has wreck 'd me ? “ Say , bright Instructreſs , Soother of the Soul ! “ Whose flowing Numbers , strong as Jeſse 's Harp , “ Despair ne'er heard , but loathing left the Soul , “ Dire Fiend , whom sounds of joy cou 'd ne'er allure . “ O say , for strong-ey 'd Faith has borne You far , “ Beyond the gloomy Chambers of the Grave , “ Speak loudly to my late-corrected Soul , “ That sure reward awaits the blameleſs Mind , “ Else will I give the strenuous struggle o'er , “ Throw up your Angel Mind as painted Shade , “ Or notion strong from early precept caught , “ Rove thro ' the Maze of all-alluring Sense , “ And this side Jordan every hope shall fix ; “ Mere ravings all -- these crude Ideas die “ As Faith to Calvary 's Mount directs my view , “ Nor will I lose , thus humbled as I am , “ My dear bought claim to Immortality . “ Excuse me , Stella ! lo ! I guideleſs stray , “ No friendly hand aſsists my wilder 'd thought ; “ Uncouth , unciviliz 'd , and rudely rough , “ Unpolish 'd as the form thrown by by Heav'n , “ Not worth completion , or the Artist 's Hand , “ To add a something more . -- Such is the Mind “ Which Thou may'st yet illumine ; tis a task “ For Angels thus to raise the groveling Soul , “ And bid it pant for more than earthly bliſs . “ Then shew Heav'ns op'ning glories to my Eyes , “ And I will view Thee as the Fount of Light Which pierc 'd old Chaos to his depth profound , While all his native horrors stood reveal 'd . My dear friend if you are not all wonder , my Enthusiasm has exceedingly misled me She has a bright and glowing Imagination and so exact a Taste that her Epithets are as happily chosen as those of our best Poets . I shall be impatient to know , if the Admirable judges you are with , and Yourself think of her as I do . Take another Paſsage “ Blest Pair ! O had not Souls like Yours been given “ The dubious Atheist well might doubt a Heav'n ; “ Convinc 'd , he now deserts his gloomy stand , “ Owns Mind the noblest proof of a creating Hand . Many thanks for Your friendly communication about the State of your Affairs ; You account very prudently for the delay . Let me hear from You soon and believe me ever most affectionately Yours H M
