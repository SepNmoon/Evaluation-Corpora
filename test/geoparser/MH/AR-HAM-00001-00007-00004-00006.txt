My good Miſs Hamilton I feel myself so much obliged to you for the Pacquet which Mrs. Newton was so obliging to send me this morning , that I look upon myself as bound to take the advantage of the very first Post to return you my best thanks . I very frequently lament the want of opportunities of paying my respects to you . Tis an odd circumstance that tho ' we are engaged in the service of the same family , & within a distance leſs than twenty miles , we should be as much strangers to each other , as if we were in two different Countries . I was very happy to discover the handwriting of Miſs Hamilton , & no leſs pleased to hear a good account of that very valuable woman Lady C . whom to know is to admire . Her Letter was particularly pleasing to me , because I had been anxious about her for several weeks , past , not having been able to learn a syllable about her , or Lord Winchelsea in this neighbourhood . I enclose to you the other Letter you entrusted me with . At present I know not what to say to the principal subject of it . It is so very delicate a matter to venture to recommend a person for so important a Charge , that one ought to use the greatest care & circumspection : I will certainly take the earliest opportunity of paying my respects at Kew , but shall say nothing upon the subject , unleſs it is first mentioned to me . When that opportunity will present itself I can not tell , as my Collegue is upon his leave of absence : I am not without hopes but that I shall have it in my power to pay my visit on Saturday , as P.E . expects to be summoned to Chelsea on that day , and Mr.B . gives me to understand , he beleives my attendance will be dispensed with . One part of the letter you enclosed to me pained me much ; Tis that , in which great anxiety is expreſsed about your state of health . I hope to God there is no reason why your friend should be alarmed . Pray take care of yourself on the approaching Festivity . I am afraid you will suffer for the neceſsary consumption of spirits , & exertion on that joyous occasion . But I ought to recollect that I am trespaſsing upon time , which I am sure could be much better employed : I shall therefore conclude with signing my self My dear Madam Your much obliged most obedient Servant Prince Edward Mr Bryuyeres at the Queens Lodge Windsor
