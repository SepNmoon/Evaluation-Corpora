Wolverton September 5 th 1808 My Dear Cousin I am very much concerned that it will not be in my power to wait upon you & Mr Dickenson tomorrow but the accounts of the death of Mrs Cathcart s Sister in law Mrs Taylor ( who was widow of Coln Stephen Fremantle ) leaving some very unprotected girls together with an alarming manner in which a Nephew of hers is returned in Portugal renders her so unwell & uncomfortable that I can not leave her just at present . I will as soon as I can which I hope will be very shortly make you a visit in the mean time remembering us mos kindly to Mr . & Mi≈øs Dickenson Beleive me most Faithfully Yrs AH Cathcart
