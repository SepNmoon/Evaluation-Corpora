Taxal Janry : 21 st : 1771 my dear Miſs Hamilton before you did me the honour to write to me , I told you I was the worst Correspondent in the World . & I have not deceiv 'd you . but how is it poſsible you shou 'd wish for a Letter from me , who in this little retirement can find nothing , which deserves to be the subject of one , to a young Lady ? my whole employment is my Family & Children ; if you cou 'd see some of them , I think they wou 'd divert you , but that which is pleasing to a fond Mother , is too insignificant to be committed to paper . but I shou 'd think nothing triffling , which wou 'd in return procure me a Letter from you . You will easily gueſs , who is the bearer of this , by his complexion ; he has had great disadvantages by being brought up at a Country School , but I hope your fine Town will polish him . You ' l excuse me not saying more at present , I woud not let this opportunity slip by without paying my compts- . to you , tho ' I am under a good deal of Anxiety upon parting with my dear Boy . Sally often talks of you with pleasure & gratitude . I beg you will present my best respects to Mr & Mrs : Hamilton , & I am Your Affect & oblig 'd S Dickenson Mr D : desires I will give his Compts : to you , tho he has not the pleasure of knowing you . To Miſs Hamilton Northampton
