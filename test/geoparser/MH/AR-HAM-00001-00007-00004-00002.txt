I take the Liberty of informing you , my dear Miſs Hamilton , that I deliverd your kind Invitation to Mrs Tufnell , who thinks herself very much obliged , and will with great Pleasure accept of it , if she is in Town at the Time of the Prince 's Christening : this is not altogether certain ; she hopes , and requests therefore that you will not disappoint any one on her account . -- Do you ever now take a Trip to Eastbourne ? or are you totally engroſs 'd by the gayer scenes of Windsor ? Mr B . read me a Paſsage from a Letter of your 's this morning : as if by magical Enchantment I was transported to Beachey Head , the Sea , and a much more delightful Object on my right hand ; on my left -- but I will not tire you with a description of my Reveries ; weak minds alone delight in them ; as however they make me happy , I hope I may be permitted sometimes to indulge them ; to describe them , I 'll own , is unpardonable . When we left E.Bourne the weather no doubt must have cast a Gloom on our minds . Fisher never spoke a Word till we were arrivd at Herstmonceaux and I did not feel myself at all disposd to disturb his contemplations ; so on we went sad , and silent . The good folk at Battle gave us an hearty welcome on Sunday night , and a Dance on Monday Evening . Such Belles , and such Beaux ! Oh Guardian Angels ! my Fellow Traveller was obliged to take some Peppermint water before we went to Bed : he is I think at present by no means well ; so very delicate a Constitution requires more care than he gives it -- I have lately preachd on that head , he hears me very politely , and goes on his own way : a little Patience however is requird in a Work of Reformation : I mean to preach again I wish I had your Powers . Mr Roberts says he never saw t s o great an Improvement as in Princeſs Elizabeth : That your every wish , and Endeavour may be crownd with an equal succeſs is the ardent Prayer of your sincerely aff . Friend and obl humble Servt John Farhill Kew Octr . 18 th My respectful Compts wait on Lady C. Finch Miſs Hamilton Queen 's Lodge Windsor
