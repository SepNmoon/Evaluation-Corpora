Edinburgh 1 st . July 1784 . I do confeſs , My Dear Sister , that the contents of your letter did surprise me not a little . It is so long since I have heard You mention Mr. D—— , that I naturally concluded the Letter you wrote him two or three four Years ago had put an end to his Hopes . When you consulted me at that time on the expediency & c of the Match , I fairly , candidly & honestly gave you my Opinion . I shall be again as open and not hesitate to say that Mr. D . 's present conduct seems to prove him strictly sincere in his Attachment to You and perfectly disinterested in repeating his Proposals . Removed from your Office near the person of your Royal Mistreſs , he can have no ambitious views of increasing his fortune from your Interest with her . Your own private fortune is not sufficiently great to suppose that to be his temptation . Your own worth and intrinsic merit can alone be the inducements Mr. D . has had to appear once more as an humble supplicant on your Imperial Will . I must therefore be of opinion that your friends can not disapprove of your making choice of him for your Husband . The Seige of Troy has been a Joke to the Seige poor Mr. D . has been obliged to carry on , & if I rightly understand your letter You intend to be so unmercifull as to prolong it till next Winter . As this is perhaps the last time I shall have a right to advise , I beg leave to say that I recommend it most earnestly to You not to delay this matter but to put an end to it as soon as poſsible . This I think Mr. Dickenson has a right to expect after the length of time he has waited for Your Ladyship 's hand , and as you know I approve of expedition in these matters , I insist on your paying implicit obedience to my Commands . I sincerely hope You will find all your ideas of Matrimonial felicity compleatly answered and when I add my wishes for your being as happy as Maria and I , let me tell You I have not said a little . She says she is thoroughly rejoiced that You think of becoming One of Us , being confident that few people poſseſs the qualities neceſsary to render Matrimony happy in a greater degree than You do -- My Commiſsion as Captain in the 4 th . or Kings Own Regiment of Foot is at last Signed . The Regiment is now on Dublin Duty , but as the Review is over for this Year I have applied for leave of Absence for as long a time as my Commanding Officer may think fit . It would be very inconvenient for me to leave Britain this Winter as I shall probably have busineſs before the House of Peers relative to the Sale of my Entailed Estate , which may make my presence in London neceſsary . I shall then hope to be not only introduced to Mr . but to Mrs- D .. My Sisters are both well . Mrs. Hunter about a fortnight ago produced another Daughter . A very fine Child & promises to be handsome . Adieu . Write to me when you have leisure and beleive me ever sincerely interested in your happineſs . Ever Your Affectionate Brother Napier . Lord Napier July 1784
