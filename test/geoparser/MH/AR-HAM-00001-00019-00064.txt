Shaw Park 28 th of July 1774 T'is alas but too true , my Dear Lord Cathcart , that we have lost one of the best & worthie st of Parents -- an irreparable loſs to us all , but more particularly so to my two little Sisters , who , poor innocents , have lost a mother almost before they know what a bleſsing she was to them . -- Our distreſs my dear Mary Napier ( née Cathcart ) , is the greater as it was so unexpected a stroke , it being only the tenth day of our dear mamma 's illneſs , we did not , ti l that day , apprehend the smallest danger , but far , ve ry far from our thoughts was her death removed ; He tha t givith affliction , is both able & willing to support them tha t call on him & put their trust in him .... Miſs Hamilton 's health for some time has not been very good , but thank God he is better then I expected tho ' far from being what I could wish . We are much obliged to Miſs Hamilton & you for your kind wishes , It ho w happy woul d I have been if I could have contradicted the new paper but God 's will , be done . I hope you will forgive my not proceeding with this malencholy subject as it is too much for me to bear . & believe me to be my Dear Papa your affectionat e Friend & Cousin Mrs. Hamilton P.S . Papa desired me to tell you he has received your long letter Adieu
