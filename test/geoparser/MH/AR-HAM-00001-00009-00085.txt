Mrs J Dickenson 1790 You are both very shabby correspondents but knowing your frailty in this respect I will not upbraid -- I will only secretly lament -- I am not surprised that you felt all that you describe you did feel during that tremendous storm -- I was nervous & more affected , than perhaps I ought to have been , by one we had at this place ; -- do you recollect , a poem of Mrs. Carter s written at Midnight during a Thunder Storm ? -- perhaps you may not & as I do not believe you have them her Poem 's I will transcribe it . Let coward guilt with pallid fear , To shelt'ring Caverns fly , And justly dread the vengeful fate , That thunders thro ' ye . sky . Protected by that hand , whose law The threat'ning storms obey , Intrepid virtue smiles secure , As in the blaze of day . In the thick cloud 's tremendous gloom , The light'nings lurid glare It views It views the same all-gracious pow ' r , That breathes ye . vernal air . Thro ' nature 's ever varying scene , By diff'rent ways pursu 'd , The one eternal end of heav'n Is universal good . The same unchanging mercy rules When flaming Æther glows , As when it tunes ye . Linnet 's voice , Or blushes in the Rose . By reason taught to scorn those fears That vulgar minds molest ; Let no fantastic terrors break My dear Narciſsa 's rest . When , thro ' creation 's vast expanse , The last dread Thunders roll , Untune the concord of ye . spheres , And shake the rising soul : Unmov 'd mayst thou the final storm , Of jarring worlds survey That ushers in the glad serene Of everlasting day . Elizabeth Carter , ‘ To Miss Lynch : Written at midnight in a thunder storm ' , in Rev . Montagu Pennington ( ed . ) , Memoirs of the Life of Mrs. Elizabeth Carter , with a new edition of her Poems ( London : 1816 ) , pp.54-55 . In the late publication of Mr. Soame Jennings works , the Editor ( who is an intimate acquaintance of mine ) -- has done my late dr . frd . ye . Ducheſs of Portland justice by describing her in ye . following manner “ She died on ye . 18 th of June 1785 leaving behind “ her that famous Museum , replete with “ works in ye . fine arts & a most extensive “ Collection of natural History which , with “ no leſs industry than judgement & at an “ expence wch . could be only supported by her “ princely fortune , she had been the greatest “ part of her life collecting , but this collection “ however it was gazed at , & with great judgement “ admired by men of Virtue & philosophy “ of our own & foreign nations , yet , “ when compared time shall have done away all “ traces of its existence her Grace s unfeigned “ religion & piety , exact fulfilment of all “ domestic duties , superior talents of mind , “ native dignity amongst her equals , a flowing “ condescension to her equals inferiors , “ wch : made those whom she honored with “ her acquaintance forget the difference of “ their stations . Universal benevolence , & the “ most ami a able sweetneſs of temper , will cause “ cause her ever to be remembered amongst “ the most famous of her sex , whose superior “ characters reflect a lustre on the British “ Nation . ” The Works of Soame Jenyns , Esq . in four volumes . Including several pieces never before published . , by Charles Nalson Cole ( ed . ) , Vol . 1 ( London : 1790 ) , pp . 126-127 . -- This is a true picture & I could justly add more to it -- I should not have sent it to you my dr . Sisters but that I thought ye . publication might would not soon have fall en in to your hands -- & I thought such a character worthy of interesting you even by description . I wish you could have been here during ye . time Miſs Phillips favored us with her company -- she is so chearful at ye . same time sensible & discreet . Our dear Father seems quite delighted with her character , & many an hearty laugh have we shared between with them -- Pray open & read ye . enclosed paper & put it upon his pillow so that he may find it when he goes to bed -- I have written it -- but do not acknowledge from whence it came & c .
