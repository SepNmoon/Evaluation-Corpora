My dear Friend ! I meant to have written to you immediatly on my arrival here which was this Day sev'night , but some how or other ones purposes are seldom put in execution & I have not been very well -- I did not leave London till Sunday morning , I was you know to have set out on Friday , but my Brother had a return of his ague on Thursday , & another Fit on Saturday , which detained & alarmed us very much , I never left him a moment Day or night , the anxiety and fatigue made me ill for some Days after my arrival here but I am better again , especially since the violent thunder=Storm we have had this morning -- it has relieved the air & our lungs of that dreadful weight which was become quite oppreſsive , we pray for more rain , everything is burnt up & all the Cattle absolutely starving , I aſsure you that their lament ation & cries for food go to one 's heart , and yet we are better off than our Neighbours , on account of the water -- My Brother is very far from well , he keeps off the fever with Bark , but it is hanging upon him & I am sure he will never be quite well till he has another regular Fit -- I found my Father thank God quite well , you may imagine my dear that we were very happy to meet after so long an absence . They would have had a very pleasant & improving journey but for my Brother 's illneſs who kept his bed three Weeks at Fairfield -- however they saw all the Lakes in Cumberland & Westmoreland & my Brother gives an account of them that excites my curiosity & a very strong inclination to make the same tour -- I have seen nobody yet -- except Mr Newman who dined here & you may suppose let us into all the private History of the Winter at Northamton & c. -- we shall have very little visiting this Summer thank God -- I really think it quite cruel to be routed from ones comfortable home & occupations , to stuff in a chaise broiling in the heat I must regret Lady Wake tho ' & the Throckmortons who are both the best & pleasantest People in the World & who I fear will never come to Weston again -- I begin my visits beyond Northamton tomorrow , the Suttons Thursby 's & c -- & I believe I must go for a couple of Days to Sir J. Langham s , I wish it over -- When do you leave Town my dear sure you can not bear that hot dusty place any longer -- if you do not make haste you will certainly have a wet bad Season for your tour in Derbyshire , besides I am , & so are we all very impatient to see you here , 1000 things may happen , we may go to Wakefield to Weston in Staffordshire Sir H. Bridgeman s , inshort I wish to make sure of you whilst we are stationary , for I shall certainly not be so much this Summer -- pray pray come remember me kindly to Mr Dickenson , I wish much to introduce him to my Father & Brother , I can not say much for the Beauty of this place now tho ' I believe it is better than most others , but even here the verdure is gone -- the Severity of the Winter has killed all the Green House plants and many of the Shrubs in my Flower Garden which being only in its first infancy has felt the cold very much -- it is however a great amusement to me & I watch the progreſs of every plant -- We play & sing a great deal , & I am occupied 2 hours the morning with my little Child Charlotte who is pretty & very good -- & will I daresay turn out very well -- adieu my dear Friend if you have time write to me soon & pray let it be to fix your coming , adieu your affecte : CMG Horton July 17 th 1785 To Mrs Dickenson No 27 Clarges Street London
