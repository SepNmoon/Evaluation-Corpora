Waltham Abbey Monday Morng . 31 st . Octr . My dear Madam , I wish I could write a Letter that would delight your tender Heart , but alas ! you must prepare yourself for one of a very different nature -- Sir William Wake has had a severe fit of the Gout , & is now no more -- He was relieved from his Miseries on Saturday about 11 O'Clock or Later in the morning . Lady Wake & her Son & Daughter came got here from Banktop yesterday evening , & met her friend Lady Cremorne at Mr Berwick 's House . I leave it to her to tell you how Lady W . is -- I met them at Hodsden to prepare them for the worst , & slept in the same with William , whose Afflictions have shewn themselves in the properest manner , & whose Conduct has been exemplary indeed . The Miſs Wakes are as well as one could expect -- Dear Charlotte was the only one of his family who was with him . She is a wonderfull Child . Expreſses have been sent to Mrs. Fenton & Mr Baldwin Wake , & as much has been done as the time would admit . Your 's most sincerely W. Antrobus Kind Comps to Mr. Dickenson I can not my Dr : Friend , let this go without sending one Line to tell you that our Dr : Friend , is resigned & tolerably composed -- I shall be constantly with her , 'till She leaves this & then I shall take her to Chelsea 'till She can settle about where She will go . I have so many Letters to write for her upon Busineſs that I can not add more than that I am -- truly yours PCremorne I fear this will affect you much , but I beseech you not to give way to too much grief for our dr Friend , She is as well as I cd have hoped . -- Mr. Wake desires me to tell you with his kindest Love that he did intend to fill up the Sheat himself , but that having been but just let blood , he hopes will not expect it . -- He will write to you by tomorrow 's Post . He is now tolerably well , & making himself more so than he really is that he may be of use to his Mother and Sisters -- God bleſs you -- My Dr : Sir -- Pray read this Letter & shew it when you judge proper to Dr : Mrs : Dickinson Yr : faithful & Obliged PCremorne To -- J.
