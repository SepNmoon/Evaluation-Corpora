2 d . July -- 1789 -- This day did not turn out as I prognosticated -- Ingles & I rode to old Down 14 Miles from hence on the Exeter Road where we stopt -- I sent his servant on to Stone easton the seat of Mr. Cox Member for this County . with a Letter to Mr. Hipsley , who married Mr. Cox 's sister , who returned us an Invitation to Dinner , as there were some doubts about this , & our appetites not brooking any delay , we ransacked the Larder at the Inn for Cold Meat , with which we were agreeably amusing ourselves when the servant arrived , & tho all reasonable people wd . have been perfectly satisfied , yet an order was immediately given to put the Cavalry in motion & to storm the Castle Sword in hand -- the gates were opened and we received with great courtesy by the Deputy Governor Mr. Hipsley , also by his Lady , who in the opinion of my brother Traveller , is a perfect Goddeſs -- Mr. H . who is a clergyman , is a very well-bred Man , & his manners are very engaging -- a Mr. Stroud ( member for some place ) & his chubfaced wife & a very young Man with a Cockade in his hat -- also a country justice arrived soon after us -- Mr. Cox did not make his appearance till we were sat down to dinner -- he is a very large Man , I suppose weighs 22 Stone at least , seems active , his countenance is sensible & he would have been handsome , but for his under Lip which is thick & has in no play in its muscles -- he was very civil to us -- the dinner and Wines were suitable to his fortune which is 16000 £ a year -- the conversation turned a little to politicks in which I took no part , but chiefly to justice businiſs , which at all times is a delightful Subject -- I had an opportunity of enquiring after Lady Mordaunt , who is rather better -- we left this Seat of plenty at ½ past 7 & had a cheerful ride thrō the pleasantest Country I have hitherto seen -- which you wd . have enjoyed equally wth . me -- how often did I wish to hear you exclaim “ Mr. D. Mr. D . look to the right ; how beautiful that Scenery ! ” & c & c -- I need not tell you how greatly this wd . have added to my pleasure -- 3 d / I called upon Ingles at 8 -- we walked for ½ an hour at 2 I met Mrs . I . as I was going to call upon them & went a shopping with her which ( entre nous ) She receives greater pleasure from than her Husband wishes I staid a little time with Ingles & took my leave of them as they set out this afternoon for Lady Fust s to whom I sent Compts- at my return home I had the felicity of meeting with yr- Letter of the 28 June -- & went immediately to the pump room to examine the list of arrivals -- the Pump Man told me that at this time of the year Names were invented merely to make an appearance of a long list of arrivals -- there was no Kinder , but a Dickenson , not my sweet Cozn .. at 7 I called at the Rundells & went to Mrs. Milnes . Miſs M . told me it was very prejudicial to me to read or write or to be much occupied whilst I was drinkg the water . She soon changed her opinon when I proposed to read a book to her & her mother wch . She had recommended to me -- on history of the late revolution in Holland -- with which She seemed much pleased & I promised to go there when I can -- we began -- but cd . not proceed , for the inceſsant gabbling of a whist party -- I spent two hours very pleasantly & came home -- Miſs M . charged me to say a 1000 civil things for the Hair for which She was more obliged to you than she cd . expreſs -- the first time I called upon her was not by design , & had not that precious relick in my pocket ; so that I could give you no Acct . of its reception / 4 / I bathed last night , & this morning called upon Mrs. Holroyd & staid ½ an hour with her . She is much engaged in her attendance upon an old Lady , who is very anxious to die , which She has been in constant expectation of for a considerable time -- Mrs. H . does not choose to leave her -- but as soon as the Lady is dead -- Mrs. H . means to go to Ireland to spend a few months amongst her own & some of our agreeable freinds -- I find Mrs. H . s principal weakneſs arises from family pride & the recent Nobility of their blood has by no means diminished her self satisfaction -- she was exceſsively laughed at a few days ago by a party where I was -- but that does not take away from her Merit -- She told me that Mrs. Hartley had thanked her for introducing me to her , this was very flattering to me -- I left my Name at the Isted 's & Vanbrugh 's -- yesterday was the hottest day we have had this year , & this day again is cloudy & will rain -- 5 / I meant to have gone to Mrs. Hartley 's last night , but the great quantity of rain that fell in the Afternoon made the air so damp that I durst not venture out & I did not choose to be at the expence of Chair Hire -- The Wetneſs of this morning prevented my going to Church , however I read a very good sermon of Tillotson s to Mrs. Davies & her Daughters The weather cleared up at one & at 2 Mr . & Mrs. D . their two eldest Daughters & I marched to a little Cottage about half a mile from Bath where we dined with a Mr. Simpson -- a young Man of good fortune , who was a Lodger here & has taken this place as a home in this neighborhood -- he gives Claret & c -- I dont know what will become of us in a few years for every young man with or without a fortune now can bear nothing but Claret -- there is no Wine fit for a Gentleman to drink but that precious Liquor -- the more this country is taxed & the more extravagant the inhabitants of this country become -- I must now tell you of an agreeable circumstance which I am sure will give you pleasure -- this morning when I was at the pump room I had the satisfaction pleasure of meeting Mr. Sackville who is come to make some stay , he informed me that Sir Robt . Herries was in town who came up to us in a few minutes . Sir Robt . came from Exeter yesterday -- I was really very glad to see Mr. Sackville as there is no man for whom I have a higher esteem & he seemed equally pleased to meet me -- Mr. S . is not well & Sir Rt . means to drink the water for a week or ten days -- I believe Lady Herries has wrote to inform you of the death of her lovely sister & you will be glad to hear that She bears up under this affliction wonderfully -- She is to stay at Teignmouth till Sir Robert can return & take her to Paris -- this information I had from Mr. S . & he added -- it will be an excuse for S. R . to ride his Hobby again . I think he does not approve of those frequent journeys -- it was lucky that Lady H . could be with her Sister for being convinced , that if the poor Soul could live , She must be a miserable Criple all her Life -- would induce the most affectionate heart to wish for her release -- Nina is tolerable Mr. S . supposes that She may be kept nearly in the state that she is -- / 6 / I called on Mr. Sackville at 9 & sat ½ an hour with him , Sir Robt . came in whilst I stayed -- I left them at breakfast & came home to mine -- at 2 I met Sir Robt . in Milsom Street , we talked of Mr. Sackville s irresolution in not consulting a Physician -- for he had drank only one small glaſs of water & had been disordered the whole day -- & we concluded the best way would be to send one to him -- as he had mentioned Dr. Harington we immediately went to his house , where I left Sir R . at 6 oClock I called & found them playing at Backgammon , Mr. S . said in his good humored way -- that we had picked his pocket & that we ought to have left it to him to determine whether he should throw away any money in that way or not -- I played with Mr. S . in the course of the game Mr. S . whistled having made a bad throw which reduced him to a dilemma , & which is a common thing for an Englishman to do -- Sir R . told us that if we were to whistle upon such an Occasion in France that we shd . undoubtedly be obliged to fight , & he gave us this instance as a proof of his aſsertion -- L. Eglintown was at play in Paris & in a similar situation with Mr. Sackville whistled -- upon which the Frenchman tapped him on the Shoulder & walked into another room , whither Ld . E immediately followed him , supposing that the other wanted to speak to him -- but to his great astonishment found him with his sword drawn & in an attitude for fighting -- Ld . E . enquired into the cause of this & the Frenchman told him that he had insulted him & must fight , Ld . E . asked what it was that he deemed an insult , the other said that in France they whistled to Horses & not to gentlemen -- luckily Ld . E . had not his sword or he might have fallen a victim to French Punctilio , & before he cd . procure one the matter was made known & some sensible people explained to the hot Frenchman the impoſsibility of Ld . E 's having meant any affront to him from what might have escaped him involuntarily -- Sacville said he was obliged to Sir R . for he certainly should have whistled if he had been then in France -- I beat this good Creature & went to Mrs. Hartley 's where I had a pleasant reception & staid with her till 9 . She desired to know where I lived that she might send to me -- & lamented that you was not in Bath -- I returned to my two friends , when we had a Rubber at Backgammon which I won & left them at ten oClock -- I was not overjoyed to find our West Indians returned -- one of them , Capn . Paris , mentioning the punishments that are inflicted upon the Blacks , said that for capital Crime ye- Convict is always burnt -- for a Black man or woman will see their dearest relatives put to death with the greatt . composure & will rather rejoice if they can have the body to bury , for when a Black is buried they say he is gone home & are sure he is happy whatever crimes he may have been guilty of -- so that Burning is the only punishment that strikes their minds with any degree of horror -- this morning I met Mrs. Holroyd in the Street who complemented me on the improvement of my looks I called upon Mr. Rundell who invited me to dine there , but I excused myself for today , & promised to dine with them on friday or Saturday -- he advised me to take another dose of Castor oil -- which I propose to do tomorrow -- he thinks it will aſsist the Waters very effectually -- I met Mrs. R . upon the parades She has been much taken up with aſsisting Mrs. Beavoir whose Husband is dead & I found her giving orders for the funeral -- I have not yet got Mrs. Piozzi s Letters , but shall have them soon -- / 7 / I am lying in today and am as well as can be expected -- in my last I forgot to expreſs my great grief & concern which has mightily affected my spirits , for not havg brought one of your Shoes with me ; however we can ease my conscience by this means order Morrison , ( dear Soul ! what pleasing expectations may she not form in her mind from my return -- as I am every day reminded of her goodneſs to me -- & she may depend upon my gratitude ) to take an exact measure of the length of the inside of your shoe , which may be remeasured by a piece of thread & a knot upon it ( not such a knot as She dreams of every night ) will ascertain that important point -- then a string fitted exactly round the instep will clear that difficulty , & also the number of miles & exact distance from the point of the foot to the other point that covers yr well turned instep will set this matter in so clear a light that any number of Shoes may be produced in obedience to yr commands Adieu my dearest , best friend -- write me another charming Letter & believe that your D is the happiest Husband in the world -- Mr. Herschell is coming to me to day as I cd . not go to him -- I wd . learn to draw , but I find my eyes are sufficiently employed already -- Rauzzini is my next door neighbor -- but his terms I am afraid will keep us at a respectable distance -- for it too much to throw away upon my voice -- once more Adieu -- remember me most Affly to every Body -- & embrace our dear Child -- I am very well -- & shall be perfectly so when I have dined/ -- Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire X post
