July 1 st . 1782 I recd . Your dear letter ye . day after I had sent one which I would give a great deal I had not written -- let an act of oblivion be paſs 'd over it , and believe my present aſsurances that I harbour not a doubt of Your affection . I am quite shock 'd to think You have been so ill , I hope you will take every proper precaution not to get fresh cold -- I think riding on Horseback would be good for You , gentle exercise without fatigue will restore your strenght better than medicines -- what a melancholy situation indeed ! surrounded by Invalids , I hope soon to hear You are all well again & then I shall let me hear no more complaints of depreſsion of Spirits . -- Hero is expected to day . It is whisper 'd that Lord Fairford means to propose to Miſs Murray -- I have not had this from any good authority . Rhea 's eldest Daughter is quite well & I think never look 'd better . Princeſs Royal came here on Saturday to Dinner & stays till Wednesday . no great satisfaction do I enjoy from her being under ye . same Roof wth . me for I never see her but in ye . Drawing Room I wish a certain Dſs . & her Daughter wld . not come so regularly upon the T—— I think they lose their own consequence in doing so , I spoke to them on Saty . they had not heard You were so ill . I inclose a letter for Your amusement from Lady Dartrey . return it & do not let any person see it . Adieu for to day . I have as You will easily perceive written in haste Ever Ever Yours Perfecta M : H : Horton Newport Pagnel Bucks Free Wake
