Edinburgh Decr 11 th - 1774 Yours My dearest Ward I recieved two days ago & had imagined that you had quite given me up as I have not heard of you ſince I left Shaw Park , nor have I been in a condition to write myself having ever ſince I came home been confined to my Bed , & room but always to the house , and am at present very ill with a complication of distempers , nor have I had in my own opinion the least favorable Symtom till last night , all this wt ye most violent lowneſs of Spirits imaginable has really reduced me to a very poor animal & not at all the Person I was when I saw you last however I hope to get over this bout & that my health will mend by the spring -- & that I may once more enjoy that health I formerly had wh- out which nothing can be be pleasing & of which I have ſeen little or not none these Six or Seven years past . I believe the two marriages you have heard off will take place ſoon but its Miss Cathcart to the Duke of Atholl & Miss Mary to my first Couſin Mr Graham of Balgowan but unleſs they write you before their marriage I beg you 'll say nothing about as the Duchess Dowager deſires it may not be spoke off till o ver what her whim for that is I know not but its eaſily indulging her in that triffle -- I hope Sir Wm Wake will gain his Seat as he is so very keen of it and as my friends are all out of Parliament at present I really can not command a single frank . Mr Dundas is out , as for Jack Hope there never was nor never will be the least chance of his sitting now , I did not see him when in Scotland . I hope Mrs Hamilton is now quite well . My Son has got in to the Army in the 31 st Regt of Foot but will be a few years in Scotland carrying on his education as the Regt is to be quartered here for ſome Years which was one great inducement to his going into that Regiment Adieu My deare st Mary I am able for no more this being my second letter in many months , remember me & mine to Mrs Hamilton & they deſire their best wishes to you & Believe me to be My dearest Girl most affctly Yours Napier This Letter written upon ye . Death Bed of my Dearest Friend -- he died I answer 'd it by return of post & in answer 'd recd . ye . heart-breaking intelligen c e from his Son Ld . Napier that I had for ever lost my beloved my valuable Friend -- he lived but about 5 months after Lady Napier s Death -- May the God of infinite Mercy receive their Souls & may we meet in Heaven -- never to part again .
