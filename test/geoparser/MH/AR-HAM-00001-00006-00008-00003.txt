Dear Madam , I ſtaid after Mrs : laſt night , expecting you would have resumed the Subject of Mrs : Rogers tho ' I was unwilling to do it myself , in the humour you then seem 'd to be against me . As there is no body 's good opinion I value much in this Town , but your 's & Miſs Hamilton 's , I muſt tell you , that my Suspicion of having loſt That , provoked me againſt the Tattlers of the place . I long supposed you could not be blind to my Affection for Miſs Hamilton , but I imagined , that as a ſensible Woman you wink 'd at it ; as , from your paſt kindneſs to me , it was alſo natural to imagine , you could have no other Objection than my want of fortune , which might hereafter be accidentally removed . A remarka ble Change , however , in you r & Miſs H : 's behaviour to me of late , put me on gueſsing at the Cause ; -- and I found that Mrs : R had told you , you did wrong to truſt Miſs H : in my Company . -- This , & the id le Stories of other people , may have occaſion 'd a prejudice aga inſt me , which I will not attempt the contrary , I confeſs to you , that had any Affection for me , & there was probabi lity of my making her happier than to be at home , I ſhould not think I behav ed ung ratefully or injuriously to you , in marry ing yo ur conſent ; for it has always been the do ctrine taught me by my own father , & which I ſtill profeſs ; that Children are , by the Law of God & Nature , entitled to the Dispoſal of their own Perſons , when arrived at the Years of Discretion , altho their Parents ought ever to offer them their beſt Aſsiſtance & Advice . -- Should this declaration of my ſentiments , my dear Madam , give you any Concern , I ſh ( which , from Miſs H 's behaviour to me , I think it never ought , ) I ſhall not take amiſs your giving me no more invitations to your Houſe ; & I promise you , ( to make you entirely ea sy , ) that before Miſs H : 's Return from London , I ſhall have found out ſome Other Retreat . -- I am , with conſtant regard , Dear Madam , Your much obliged & affecte : hum : Servt : Miſs H : Sunday , 13 Decemr :
