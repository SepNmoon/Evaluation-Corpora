April 9 th -- My dear Miſs Hamilton I did not doubt but that you would feel very sincerely for the heavy Stroke that it has pleas 'd God to Strike with us with -- but more particularly for the Unhappy Parents of the most Lovely Child that ever Parents were bleſs 'd with -- Dr & Mrs de Salis . & my Mother & I are all very sensible of yr goodneſs & Compaſsion -- Dr de Salis has not been well for some time & Suffers very dreadfully from a Rhumatism in his Face & teeth -- he however Exerts himself for the sake of his Afflicted Wife beyond what I thought human nature Capable of . & I must Acknowledge the high Sense I have of his merit by the Constant restraint he puts upon himself when I have been for 5 years a Witneſs to his affection & tenderneſs towards his dear little Girl who was of a disposition to attach all those who liv 'd with her . beyond what I could have conceiv 'd -- my Mother is better this day in health than she has been -- I was much alarm 'd for the Consequences of such a Calamity at her Advanc 'd Age . & she Grieves beyond what one sd expect at her time of life when the feelings are Seldom so quick -- & for my self I can only add that I lov 'd that sweet Child as much as I am capable of loving any thing in this World -- but I do not put my self in Competition with her Parents her poor Mother is now forc 'd to Sleep by Opiates every Night . & whilst the effect Continues she is Stupefy 'd but as soon as it goes off . then she is so miserable as makes me despair of her getting over it . if we did not know that he who has inflicted the Wound is mighty to heal -- the only human Consolation we can ever receive is a Melancholy one -- but we are aſsur 'd by two Skilful Physichians that the poor lovely creature could never have been scar 'd -- that this disorder was caus 'd by some unseen defect , which is inexplicable -- & so far we must be thankful that she is gone in her State of Innocence -- & if she had Continued as promising as she was 3 Months ago -- the Stroke wd have been still more heavy -- I am ever my dear Miſs Hamilton yr ever Affect & oblig 'd Friend DBloſset -- Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street --
