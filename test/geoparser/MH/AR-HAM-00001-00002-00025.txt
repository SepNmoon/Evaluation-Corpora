27 July 1789 -- Bath -- I was very sorry to send you so short a letter but I was resolved not to omit another post -- my time is so much taken up that unleſs I steal a short space after dinner -- before 7 in the morng or after eleven at night -- the day slips away to my astonishment & you are left in the Lurch -- tho never out of my Mind -- I have now exactly 20 minutes to spare , without a fraction for the most agreeable Amusement I have , which is writing to you my dearly beloved Wife -- And so Mrs. Yellow Face your natural curiosity , is all alive & restleſs to know who that agreeable , charming , pleasant woman is , who did me the honor to take compaſsion upon me in your Absence -- in this instance I shall not gratify you , as those kind of aſsignations are always kept inviolably secret by Men of Honor -- Not to distreſs you by enlarging upon my felicity . I will , out of pure compassion , return to my Journal & shall raise another conjecture in your Mind to inform yourself with whom I dined to day -- an Unmarried Lady , who profeſses herself an admirer of me -- every thing was to be kept Snug -- the invitation was communicated in a secret manner -- lest too great pleasure shd satiate -- I left my Inamorata at 7 oClock -- & went to Mr. Herschell 's to have my leſson which I could not have in the morning as he was obliged to attend a private Concert to play Quartettos to which I was invited & went for an hour , but could stay no longer as my Drawing Master expected me -- It was Mrs. M : Isted that I dined with to day -- Mrs . I . & her daughters dined there also -- Mrs . I . spoke very handsomely of you -- She said She never met with a person that She thought so amiable & so accomplished and could almost say that She was glad She had known so little of you -- for She shd . have regretted your leaving Northamptonshire so much the more “ -- Mrs . I . is very handsome & dresses as an old woman should do , suitable to her age -- my Manners seem to please this family -- & I reckon upon being a favorite -- Mrs. Mary said She never invited any person to her house that She did not think very agreeable -- which I know myself not to be -- but an appearance of good humour & little attentions , which flow from the heart , will often gain the poſseſsor admittance into families , when the the Door is shut to a Man of Talents -- which I shd . be happy to be -- 28 / I called upon Mrs. Rundel ; spent the day as usual & after Tea walked with Major Murray -- this morning I called upon Mrs. Hocker She seems very glad to see me & I call whenever I can -- tho it be only for 5 minutes -- for the last week I have endeavored to call on the Vanbrughs but really it has not been in my power -- you would laugh to see me posting away from one Master to another -- my Mind is fully employed & it makes me happy -- to day I began to drink the Waters at 7 ( before that time I had read an hour in Mrs. Piozzi 's Travels , which I dont admire -- it is worth reading & thats all ) from 7 to half past ten was taken up in exerc i ise for two hours , dreſsing & breakfast -- at ½ past 10 . I go to my Italian Master -- after that I had a leſson from Rauzzini which is throwing money away -- from him I went to Herschell for an hour & then to my drawing Master for the same space of time & returned time enough to scribble a few lines to you & dreſs for dinner -- between 7 & 8 we all marched to the Villa gardens to see Fireworks & c but were disappointed , as something had happened to make it neceſsary to postpone this raree show -- we had a pleasant walk however -- 30 / I was this morning put out of sorts by your Letter of the 26 -- You know my dear Mary that nothing can make amends to me for the loſs of your Society -- I know yr- generous heart -- but I must confeſs that I would not have you come here for several reasons -- first of all I am in the best poſsible State of health -- Dr. F s Medicine has entirely removed the Irrittation -- the waters now agree with me , & you never saw me look so well in yr- life -- in the next place I think the same medicine , which may be made very pleasant by diluting with water , will have the same effect upon our lovely Child -- I also consider the expence which I wish to be avoided for reasons which my Love for you dictates -- & if my Father , whom I most sincerely love , will have the goodneſs to contribute something towards a short sejour here in the spring which Dr. F . wiſhes may take place -- then I should be infinitely obliged to him -- & can have the delight of my dear Mary 's Society -- however my return shall be determined by my good friend Dr. F . who seems to know my constitution more exactly than any person I ever consulted -- he is now gone to Weymouth for a few days -- tomorrow I shall go to visit the Isteds & on Saturday to Miſs More 's -- a little before 7 I called upon Mrs. Rundell who was going out , but I pe ti tioned for a few lines in this Sheet & she granted the prayer -- I have not mentioned to her that I consulted Fothergill -- perhaps it would not please -- when Dr. F . & I meet again I shall consult him about Louisa I will endeavor to get his prescription from the Apothecary & send it to you -- The Irritation on my Skin is entirely subsided -- & I feel once more quite comfortable -- my sleep is uninterrupted & I can dreſs my self without a batch of Scratching for -- half an hour -- I make no doubt but it will have the same Effect upon Louisa -- it had an immediate one upon me -- before I received your Letter I had fixed in my own mind not to leave this place till this day fortnight , which makes the three weeks you desire -- but if it is neceſsary to prolong my stay I will do it -- but I dont think it will , for I can not be better than I am -- I left Mrs R . & C o . to follow their own pursuits & I went to Mrs. Hartley who had invited me to meet her in Mrs. Hamilton 's Gardens -- there were several Ladies there who 's Names I did not hear -- we staid there an hour -- & then separated -- I returned to Major Murray & c & went with them to the Villa Gardens to see the Fireworks which were very pretty -- 31 / after breakfast I shall go to Pickwick to visit the Isted 's -- Now My dearest & best friend I must take my leave of you for a few days -- for tomorrow I shall take a little Tour to Corsham -- Dr. Stonehouse -- Lady Fust -- Adieu then my charming Mary -- Embrace our dear Child for me very very often -- and believe that it is impoſsible for one person to love another more than I love You -- Yrs . Ever Moſt Affy J.D . Pray mention me in the kindeſt and most Affe manner to Ampa -- and Mrs. Morrison is not forgot -- She has always my good wishes -- R/ Tincture of Red Roses -- 7 oz Spirits of sea salt -- 1 Drachm Syrup of Violets -- 6 Drachms Mix -- of this I took at first a Wine glaſs full every 5 hours -- now I take a glaſs the first & last thing I mean to say as soon as I get up -- & just before I go to Bed -- it is a very strong aid , but you may contrive to make it palatable for Louisa , I really think it would be of service to her -- She might try it in very small quantities -- Mrs. Davies 's youngest girl s legs were so crooked that She was as uneasy about them as you are for Louisa & by all accts . they were much worse -- now no persons legs are straiter 31 / I have just been to Mrs. Rundell & spoke to her about Louisa 's irritation -- She says you shd . give her Lime Water -- Mr. R . came in & told me the way to make it is to put / one pound of unslacked Lime into a gallon of water -- let it stand 24 hours , then take off the Film & bottle it -- you are to give Louisa a quarter of a pint twice a day -- at each time add a Table spoonful of Milk -- I spoke to Mrs R . of ye palpitation of yr heart , pray forgive me , She said you shd . de al of exercise & not drink Tea -- Dr F . wishes that I would not be Tea -- which I certainly will not do he recommends Tapioca . 1 ) Pray inquire if the Cowslip Green Coach stops at that place ( in its way to Buxton ) all night as it does coming this way -- I mentioned to Mrs. Rundell yesterday , who was going to Mrs. Beavoir s , that you had desired me to call upon her -- she said she would deliver yr- enquiries 2 ) I told Mrs. R . that I was perfectly satisfied -- & knew you so well as to be aſsured that you would never give up any acquaintance or friend particularly ( however plausible they might make their story ) without having good grounds for your proceedings -- & that your acquaintance was extensive enough without enrolling the Name of Mrs. Beavoir in that number 3 ) This day is so exceſsively bad that it is impoſsible for me to go to ye Isteds -- we have a very heavy & it looks like a general rain -- My Dr Madam Mr Dickinson has flattered us with the pleasure of seeing you in the Spring , I hope you will not diſsapoint us as I am very desirous of seeing yourself & your Dr Loisa I hope to write more very soon I am Dr Madam your very obliged M. Rundell / My dr- Ms D . Your husband is wonderfully well , & is in excellent spirits , he is in full employ , which is the best specific against langour -- He tells me that you are uneasy about him but I really think there is no occasion -- I never saw him look so well -- Louisa s legs are crooked ; if you suspect them to be occasioned by a tendancy to rickets , I would advise you to bathe her legs up to her knees and over them , in a pail of warm water , rubbing them well with neats foot oil , the former every other night , the latter every night -- & give a little physich once a week , but if there are no other signs of rickets than the legs then only use the oil & good rubbing , & the bow will go off as she gains strength Adieu God bless you , May all comfort attend you prays your affecte M : E : R Single Sheet To Mrs. Dickenson Manr .
