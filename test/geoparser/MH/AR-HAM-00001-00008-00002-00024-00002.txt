Audley End Feby 6 th 1801 Chere Amie Many Thanks to you for yr letter , & to your good Husband for going over to my Cottage -- I have no doubt but I was ill advis 'd by Mr Partridge to Employ Major Gilpin s Workmen . but Alas ! what is a poor female to do -- quite alone , no one ready at hand to advise with . the temptation was to save carriage , ( which between our selves ) I did not do having paid 18 S . for Carriage -- but as I trust my Credit is good , having paid for all that has been done -- if Mr Dickenson will be so good to Employ his own Bricklayer , & desire Mr Robinson to let him have my little Stoves & the Copper & have them put up . the Stoves rumfordiz 'd , I shall be greatly obliged to him -- it will hasten matters -- as for putting any one into the House I could not do that , because I must then pay the Taxes & to own the truth I thought it advisable upon all accounts to have every thing ready before I put in my furniture to Avoid disputes -- which frighten me out of my wits -- if Sharpe has not sold Mr Gilpin s parlour Stove he may carry it back again for I may have that rumfordis 'd -- I am not quite sure when I shall return to Wing -- but I gueſs within three Weeks -- & so if you will tell Baily to fetch home the Whisky the first Leisure day -- my Sister has written to Stevens -- & she informs me , that I may rest satisfied that all shall go well . however she will write again -- I shall divert you when we meet with an Artifice which exceeds all belief -- I have Answer 'd it to the purpose -- as for any Apology from Either Party I neither expect it or desire it -- both father & daughter had the aſsurance to sneer at me -- for granting Anne her Pardon . & th ' o not in the words they gave me to understand without the poſsibility of a misconception , that I am a fool very likely -- but I do not think Either father or daughter , are usually the people to give me the information -- I most highly approve of Miſs Martin -- in the first place , as to the French , she will be forwarder in three Weeks . than she would be in 3 Months with Mandaist -- in the 2 d place the outside is of very great importance , & I aſsure you , that Mrs Jalebert does all she can to Encourage dreſsing very constantly -- in the third place , no one however high in situation can be too well Acquainted , with every part of Household Economy -- Miſs Neville is not quite 19 -- has however these three years every Egg -- I believe that has been spent in this House , and has done the Honours of her Father 's table since 15 -- she Carves as well as her Father . she is a very extraordinary young Lady -- quite Youthful -- not Precieuse -- but of a serious turn . I am convinc 'd that indulgence is the best plan for Education -- that these Leper Children are more Noisy than many others -- I am ready to confeſs -- but amongst the Seven -- not one nor two a fit -- or have the smallest particle of jealousy of each other in their disposition -- Mrs Jelabert does not get well but desires her best Compliments to you -- Lord B : return 'd to us in high Spirits -- I confeſs I was not the dupe of the reports which are so industriously circulated . for I feel that it is impossible without a Civil War ( which God avert . ) to get this present Vile adminestration out of their places -- the K . however has been ill us 'd . The Ministers bought the Union by a promise to Lord Cornwallis that the roman Catholicks should be prefered -- but they made this agreement without consulting the K -- when he was appris 'd of this measure he flew out & declar 'd that he never would consent to break his Coronation oath for any Man , or any set of Men in this World -- he has consulted the Arch Bishop & also the Speaker ( who is at present a great favourite ) he was extremely positive upon this Subject -- the Ministers say on their part that Lord Cornwallis will resign -- & if you recollect Lord Fitzwilliam s was recall 'd from the Government of Ireland upon account of his Countenancing the roman Catholic Cause . this new Scheme has offended him & he is off in opposition & gratton the Irish Orator & Patriot , is to come in for Ponsoby 's Borough , he is chosen for Wicklow in opposition to the Buckingham Alias Nugent interest this last piece of News will interest Sir Jonathan Lovett -- we are all very sorry to see Lady Anne Lambton s Marriage in this Days paper to Mr C : Windham , she did for a year of or more after her Husband s death behave respectably , but alas ! our frail Sex is not to be depended upon -- & we are all sorry for the reflections which will recur to the Lords of the Creation -- & how they will again revive the Story of the Ephesian Matron -- I have sent your letter to my Sister who seem 'd hurt that she had not received any Answer from you or Mr D : : I hope in her Letter of to morrow I shall hear that she has received one of your dispatches -- I trust her eyes are opening -- I am sure it will be to their Material Advantage that they should be open 'd -- I had yesterday a letter from Mrs Carter , she seems well in Health but is in great anxiety . indeed I may add that I am Equally in Trouble . our worthy & excellent friend Mrs D'Oyly is at the point of death , by Mrs Carter s account , her desorder is a Pleurisy , she was getting better but has had so many relapses & has been five Times bled . at past 70. that I dread to morrow I wrote yesterday to a Confidential upper Man servant , & begg 'd he would let me know how she was -- she has been to us all in any Situation , Either in Affliction . or in the Calmer moments of our lives , a fast , a faithful & a tender friend -- & I really Love her sincerely -- besides all these excellent qualities -- she will be to Mrs Carter an irreparable Loſs -- for her goodneſ there was not confin 'd to verbal kindneſs -- she will be a pecuniary loſs to her for she made her large presents -- I do not mean Money -- but What saved her a great deal -- & made her appear more decent than she could or would have done -- but when I think of Lady Mendip my Heart bleeds in pints . never were two Sisters , more attach 'd to each other , her Lord at 87 or 8 is wonderful as to his Understanding & appearance -- but extremely Croſs to her -- & snaps her every word he speaks . with all this attendance , which he requires from her , her Sister s Society was a cordial & one she look 'd up to . if in Case she sld survive her Lord -- she , I do Grieve from the bottom of my heart , but such is this melancholy fate of humanity -- Mrs Douglas is also very much indispos 'd & confin 'd -- I hope Mrs Carter will find a resource in Mr & Mrs Douglas -- Adieu Love to dear Mr D : & the dear Lou -- believe me truly yrs DB : Walden Feby Eight 1801 Richard Griffin , 2nd Baron Braybrooke Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Mrs. Dickenson
