Naples Jan 27 -- The various frightfull and disagreeable accidents wch . befel us on our journey really made me for some time incapable of holding a pen -- & when I did , ye . recollection of one of our adventures affected my nerves so much that I ( after having once wrote down ye . circumstanc es ) have been obliged to make Sr. Wm . Hamilton 's Secretary write me two or 3 copies that I might give ( those friends who are so good to interest themselves about me ) some account of it . wch- yu . will find inclosed -- when I attempted writing it myself -- I still feel as if ye . Horses were running away with me , & I fear I have lost my courage for ever -- Our journey thro ' Holland was delightful -- neither fears or difficulties , we went up as far as Hoorn , Medenblick , & Hemaer & where enchanted with ye . scene -- from thence we went to Antwerp & to Spa where we staid a Month , from thence to Du≈øseldorf , to Bonn from whence we embark 'd & went up ye . Rhine to Mayence , from thence by land to Manheim , to Augsbourg -- Inspruck & to Mantua where our ill luck began , by terrible & we were near being carried away upon ye . Po , by ye . violence of the Torrent -- we rested a few days at Florence & Bologna , & when we came to Radicofani found ye . Old Chateau there ( wch is ye . only lodging place on a n bare bleak Mountain ) crack 'd thro ' & partly shook down by repeated Earthquakes , we were however obliged to lodge there , tho ' the House trembled ye . whole Night so much as to burst our door wch . was bolted . ye . next day , we met wth- the accident , the account of wch . I inclose , after wch . we were obliged to stay a considerable time at Rome to wait for our poor Courier & recruit ourselves wch I ( however ) am not yet enough to go into ye . World , & I have not been one evening out except when obliged to go to ye . Queen -- I must now launch out , for I have eight Ladies to present , & I have had a terrible piece of Work about Ldy Maynard who wanted to make ye . ninth , but I thought it improper in my situation either to receive her into my house or to attempt presenting her to ye Queen , as I obliged to answer for all I present , & it is not in my above 6 or 7 Years ago that Ldy . Maynard -- was here in another Character with ye . Duke of Dorset -- Mr Mackenzie & Ldy . Betty whom yu know were at Turin in ye same Situation wth us say I have done right -- so I am quite easy tho ' Ld . Maynard says he will complain to our King of my not receiving Ldy- Maynard -- a fine complaint ! he says she shall be presented immediately to our Queen when she gets home & that Her Majesty can not refuse her -- I doubt that -- Sr. Wm . has been for a long time & is still at one of the King s hunting steats , but I am expect him tomorrow to join in my hurries .
