Edinburgh Novr , 12 th 1773 Before I anſwer My dearest Mary s letter just recieved without a date I must thank her for the Poems & ring which came ſafe to hand a few days ago the Ring was immediately ordered to dislodge my other ring & to take poſseſsion of my Left little finger where it is to remain barring accidents till I make my exit to another world wh- I am in hopes will not be in a hurry & shall be extremely glad to shew you it fifty or Sixty years hence . As to the book I am extremely ſorry that you should have taken so much trouble about it as Killarney did not deserve so handſome a binding whatever ye Village did , but tell me was there no Vanity in it to let me know that none but yr- bookbinder was capable of doing a book so well , if there was I give you credit for doing but Justice to your bookſeller as I own I know none that binds half so neatly as he does & was it not for the expence of carriage I should most certainly employ him from this -- Be aſsured My dear Girl that we are quite satisfied with your manner of expreſsing your thanks for our joint advice without your studying to make use of any other expreſsions than what your good heart has dictated in yours & believe me the first thoughts in those matters are com̅only the best that can be made use of and had not you deſired us to give it you , it would m n ot have come into my head to have offered it , especially as I never made the least doubt of you prudence nor do I imagine there was the least reason for it , but as you deſired it , it was my duty to give my best advice & be aſsured it came from my heart most ſincerely and as it pleaſes you , it has anſwered my intentions entirely & tho you had not wrote the half about it , believe me My dearest Ward that I never even thought to see you metamorphosed into one of those Characters , but only discribed them to the best of my judgement to you as I am ſure you had not been used to see them , but you have laid down the best rules I know off to guard yourself from becoming such an Animal in yours , that it would be preſumption in me or indeed in any body to ſay any more on the subject to one so capable to guide herself as you are , from what you ſay on the Subject , and remember my dear Girl , to whom much is given , much is expected a young Lady endued both by Nature and Education and has profitted so much by reading as you have done ought to be doubly carefull in every transaction in life as the Eyes of her whole acquaintance are upon her & Envy is so com̅on a Vice in this world that nothing would give so great pleaſure as seeing an amiable , sensible well educated young Lady fall into a Scrape , what a triumph for the giddy Miſses of the Age to see a ſencible Woman in an embarraſsment /as a modern novell writer ſays/ which is not uncommon . especially in Love affairs , the best way to escape them is always to be on ones guard & not to be aſsamed to acquaint ones friends & take their advice on every transaction of consequence that may fall in ones way . do not think I am raising objections you remember when & where the word was made use off and on what occaſion that is very far from my thoughts as I think no Woman can be really happy without doing her duty & anſwering the intention of her coming in to the World & without marriage its not to be done but then a Lady ought to be cautious never to enter into engagements wtout the conſent of her Parents & friends & not to let bashfulneſs hinder her from acquainting them with every offer she may get & she will always have the ſatisfaction to think that she has acted right whatſoever should be the consequence I dont mean by this that she should implicitly take the Man her friends deſire without conſulting her own Heart , for should that not agree I should fear greatly for her Happineſs I shall ſay nothing about the Stowe jaunt but that I am happy to find you was pleased on yr return home its the properest place for a Lady to be fond of whether it be with Parents or with a Husband , the old Proverb is a good one , Home 's home should it be never so homely , and the properest place for the Earthly Angells to inhabit . The thanks for the distinction and Honor & c I thought had been banished from the point of your pen , and that no such stuff should ever be mentioned The Picture shall be received with pleaſure when it comes and I shall always reckon the obligation on my side without giving you the least credit for the above nonſenſical ( a Thompſonian word ) words so adieu for some hours as I am obliged to go abroad about buſineſs -- The Good Colonel I have ſeen & who inquired much after you & told me he heard you was married to your vis a vis Mr , that mistake I cleared up & told him the truth but as for the amiable & agreeable Capt . Price The Clever Mr Thompſon & the polite Mr Egerton I know nothing of them nor have not so much as heard their name mentioned , if I ever ſee them I shall write you my opinion of them but I think its more than probable I never shall , as I seldom keep Company with officer of the Army in this Country unleſs I knew them formerly & now I 'll have leſs connexion with them as I am ſelling my Commiſsion in the Greys being tyred with being a Stroller about the Country & of spitting over a Bridge in a Country Town to devert myself when the Good people of the Town wont speak to one for fear of our carrying off ſome of their daughters . Lady Napier has been confined to her room & Bed with a very ſevere Cold & Cough for ſome time past , but to day is a good deal better & I hope she will now get quite well again ſoon . do not from what I have ſaid imagine I have quitted the Army no , no , thats not my deſign I shall continue Deputy Adjt , General for North Britain and my Rank in the Army still goes on but whither I ever will again enter into actual Service is not poſsible for me to ſay as time only can make that appear -- Lady Napier & my Young Folks join me in best Wishes to you & Mrs- Hamilton & pray do not forget me in the best manner to Mrs- Rogers poſsible tho you dont mention her in your last I take that to be yr fault as had she known you had been writing I make no doubt but she wd have sent Compts- I hope Cloe , Fanchon & Fairry are all in good Health tho you do not mention them -- Remember me to Mr Hope I know nothing for certain abt his friends but only conjecture as I never have heard them mention him . Adieu My dearest Girl God bleſs you & c & c
