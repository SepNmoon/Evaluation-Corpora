July 9 th . 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton I have no leſs than 3 Letters to thank you for so can not satisfy myself without telling you that I have recd them , & at the same time how much pleasure they afford me , & how much I thank you for them . You are so sure of all this , that I am hardly excusable for troubling you with it , but it really feels such a burden on my Mind , not to make acknowledgements where I feel they are due , that it is a indulgence to myself to do it . I fear these public Charges will again embarraſs every thing , & disturb the K s Quiet , pray send me word how he is , & whether his good Spirits keep up . I suppose the Parliament will set for ever for whilst Administration is so unsettled they can not rise . I shd think the remaining at W . the middle of the Week a more Comfortable Scheme & better for the Pſs s than going backwards & forwards , how do they think abt . that ? Pſs A . Letters are wrote quite in Spirits & are very pretty . The Acct Hawkins will have given from hence I fancy will fix her here sometime longer , indeed it ought , for the Child s sake with whom it certainly agrees so well , And as to myself , by My Family contriving to be so much with me 't is made really very comfortable . I aim to be a dont aim to all particulars in yours , but notice them all in my own mind , & am much interested & amused with them . How can that Dutcheſs keep her Post ( I mean on the Terrace ) so constantly , I think it is seeking Mortification I suppose the P . does not notice them particularly , if he does , one can Acct . for their coming . I am glad he was at Chapel . I will not add any more now for I am going to dine out , a wonderful Event here I aſsure you , tis at Cdr Dickes whose Wife is a very sensible good Sort of Woman . She has ask 'd Mrs Carter to meet us . Yrs . Ever . Mrs. F begs to be kindly remember 'd to you
