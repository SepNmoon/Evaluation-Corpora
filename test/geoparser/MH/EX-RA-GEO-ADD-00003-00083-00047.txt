I was pleased by recg a little note I did not think you would have been able to write again so soon -- I feel better & c -- I feel these marks of attention , & feel more real gratitude for them than for the most ostentatious present sent from a person who was indifferent to me Wedy . I was in waiting & was sent for to make a party at Cards The K . Q : Ly Hartford Ly Weymouth at one Table -- at the other Pſs . Royal Pſs . Augusta Lady C Finch & myself -- their Majesties were particularly affectionate & attentive to me . Thursday -- My Uncle Fk . I took him to Ly Charlotte Finch they talk 'd over old days & c -- I saw the Queen at 4 -- she was very kind -- at 6 I got to Lord Stormont s more dead than alive there Lord S—— not at home -- only my Uncle F : & Cousin Charlotte ( who is to be under Ly . S : care this winter . Ly . S was as affte & friendly as poſsible -- Friday -- My Uncle again Mr. Lyte came , they seemed mutually glad to renew their former acquaintance -- they left me at ½ past 12 I was something better & went to the Queens House . In the afternoon whilst my hair was dreſsing ( after ye Maids of Honor s dinner ) Miſs Tryon , Miſs Sophia -- or as she is called by her friends fatty Fielding , sat with me -- The former has a number of good & amiable qualities , but is rather too great a retailer of anecdotes of ye . day to be quite what I like . The other is a warm generous character -- too blunt to be always polite . I stood ye . whole time I was in waiting this Eveg . -- went to Bed when I got to St. J—— but not to sleep as my Cough was very violent -- & ye . recollection that that night last year I was up watching a dying Mother threw me into a degree of fever -- I was rejoiced at ye . return of Morng & gladly quitted my bed -- I recd . your welcome affte . tender note I will be careful of myself I know ever thing I write will be sacred -- only be careful to destroy my letters
