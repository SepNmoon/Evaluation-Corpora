Weymouth November 13 th 1790 My dear Friend ! It gave me great pleasure to receive your letter yesterday which I did on my return from Carne , Mr Li : Damer s where I had been for a few days , & to hear that you & yours were well -- I never have received the long letter you mention in answer to my last , & have often wondered why you did not write -- indeed I should have written to you again to have inquired the Cause & to have inquired after you , but I really have led so unsettled & wanderi n g a life ever since June that I have had but just time to write to Mr Digby & my Sister when they were absent & have been a most miserable corresponde nt & obliged to throw myself on the mercy of all my Friends -- I am sincerely rejoiced to hear of your health happineſs & comfort which seems to have been pretty well established ever since you married -- Mr Dickenson s health was the only circumstance wanting to compleat it , & little Louisa must indeed be a continual source of pleasure and delight -- I am glad your House is become & becoming a comfortable one -- you say nothing of coming to Town this winter or spring , have you no thoughts of it ? Now I must give you some account of myself -- I spent the beginning of the Summer at Horton tho ' not constantly there , then came into the west where we have been visiting about from place to place even as far as Devonshire till the beginning of October -- I never was better or looked better in my life -- certainly never was happier , certainly never so happy -- & thank God , I can put my hand on my heart & looking up to Heaven acknowledge with gratitude and delight that I have not a wish , but for the continuance of the bleſsings I enjoy -- change of air & place always agrees with me & I was grown quite fat & rosy -- we came here the 9 th to pay a visit to my Father & Bell who were come for her 's & my Brother 's bathing & meant to stay about a fortnight -- I was unfortunately taken ill the day after I arrived & confined 3 weeks , it was then thought that bathing would be good for me , & I am still here & shall remain near a week longer -- I have bathed 11 times & it agrees with me exceſsivly -- my F . & Bell left me on Tuesday , are gone to pay some visits at Mr Buckley 's Ld Digby 's & Lord Ilchester s in their way to Bath where they will be next week & where my Father is to drink the waters & bathe in hopes of a fit of Gout , for he has been very indifferent lately with flying gouty & rheumatic pains which we hope Bath will remove -- My Brother is very well , I left him at Carne but expect him here to day , he leaves me on Tuesda y & is going to make some visits in this part of the world till Xmas -- we go from hence to Kingston ( Mrs I. Pitt s ) , where I shall meet the M. Pitts & Cholmondely 's , then to Ly G. Buckley s then to Sherbourne & Redlynch ( Ld Ilchester ) & do not mean to be in Town till the beginni n g of January , & nothing but the wish of seeing my Sister & Mr D 's duty should induce us to go so soon , for I hate London as a place & am so well & so happy in the Country , & Mr D . prefers it so infinitly , that I look forward to the time of our being settled there entirely with infinite pleasure . I shall receive your souvenir my dear Friend with great pleasure , & shall send you my first attempt in the painting way by the first opportunity , but I hardly think it worth your acceptance , it certainly is not so but as a remembr ance I have done very little this Summer , but continu e to like it & am improved -- adieu my dear Friend -- Mr D . is absent for some days or would I am sure send his love -- remember me very kindly to Mr Dickenson & believe me ever your affec : & sincere C.M . Digby -- Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
