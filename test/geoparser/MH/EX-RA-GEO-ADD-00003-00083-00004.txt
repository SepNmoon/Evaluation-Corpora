23 d . July 1779 . I have just been reading over the letters of a friend -- who died in the prime of life -- I loved her with an enthusiastic fondneſs -- how improper for me then to write to you after the remark you made of the melancholy that oppreſses my spirits -- I wd- not do it -- but that I have appointed the time for sending an answer . Let an act of oblivion be paſs 'd my friend over the promise you extorted from me ( not to quit the Royal Family ) , then perhaps you will see the chearfulneſs natural to my disposition resume its place ; my being left at liberty can not alter or interfere with our friendship -- & that liberty is absolutely eſsential to my peace of mind , I may have no occasion to make use of it , but let me have enjoy it in idea as a resource ; pecuniary advantages I despise -- my principles are too independent for that motive to have the least weight or detain me in a situation in which I felt I was not treated in a manner I was conscious I deserv 'd , -- what a burden then upon my mind ye . laying under the obligation let what will happen , of keeping that fatal promise -- Another reason of my not being in spirits is , that I am tortur 'd with some uneasy reflections wch . I can not stifle -- the imprudence , the inconsistency -- the great impropriety of my conduct in accepting & acknowledging to return yr . friendship -- for that I am sensible there is now no remedy , -- but remember Sir my fame is dearer to me than life . for however innocent the motives wch . influence , the world every one wd . naturally , & particularly two persons wd- put a cruel construction upon a secret & clandestine intercourse correspondence were it ever to transpire . once more let me remind you I shoud utterly sink under such an event -- & even your friendship cld- not support me . You require of me to tell you freely my sentiments ; I will hazard the sending those respecting my opinion of your public appearance for I am tho u roughly convinc 'd in the eſsential you will never err -- I wd . have my friend rise superiour -- rank alone will not enable him to do so -- do not then continue to indulge yourself with viewing every object that presents itself in a burlesque light -- & do not communicate your sentiments -- if the ridiculous does strike you , & wch . it will people of quick parts & lively imaginations to every insignificant person at hand or about you -- the time is approaching near at hand when every look word & gesture of yours will be of importance the eyes of the multitude will be upon you -- & among the multitude your own good sense will suggest there may be people of discernment , sense & superiour characters ; -- ye . ingenuousneſs of your mind and the excellence of your heart will make you candidly acknowledge as well as feel that to such you wld . be pain 'd to appear in a trifling light -- one vanity I would have my friend guilty of -- if I may be allow 'd the expreſsion -- the vanity of being the first in character & manner & sentiment & may I venture to proceed -- and not to adopt the follies of others -- Your sentiments will preserve you from Adieu my friend be aſsured of my fidelity no circumstance will ever leſsen my friendship though there may be causes that separate s us for till the time that we shall all be eternally re-united I can not believe I do not go this week I will contrive to s en d wt . yo . request -- I do not promise ye . time -- I shall get it done -- for I am not yet out of debt --
