Bristol Septbr . 1 st . 84 My dear Friend We are grown most e xceedingly irregular in our correspondence ; our friendship and affection I flatter myself is e ntire and unimpaired : You indeed are somewhat p ardonable for your irregularities as You have s o interesting and so occupying an Affair u pon your hands which may reasonably be a llowed to engroſs the greatest part of your time a nd thoughts , but I have no such good excuse t o plead , and therefore my disorders and neglects a re entitled to no quarter . Mrs. Garrick did indeed give me a full and very p leasing Account of your situation , prospects , and o f the character of the amiable man whom I hope o ne day to know , and to call my Friend ; for he must be compelled to like me a little for Your sake , even if he shou 'd have made a vow not to like me for my own . I am disposed to meet him half way , for I like his character , and I love his constancy ; that single excellence wou 'd give him great merit in my eyes , were he destitute of those many others in which I know he is rich , or he wou 'd not have been the choice of my discerning Friend . I am not sure that the most shewy and specious Men make the best Husbands ; I am most pleased with that sober agreeableneſs which is exerted at home , and of which the Wife is the Object ; this is not often the case of Men whose accomplishments are mo st re brilliant than solid ; they are apt to be diverting and entertaining every where , except in that very spot where it is their duty to be so ; for I have long laid it down as a Maxim that to be agreeable to those whose lot it is to live with You , is as much a duty , as any of those which more immediately made claim the name ; for this reason it is that I think more highly of temper than of any one accomplishment , I had almost said than of any one Virtue ; for tho ' I am ready to acknowledge that there may be worth without good temper , yet that worth can never confer happineſs . And I subscribe heartily to the Sentiment of my dear Mrs. Boscawen , that if she must bespeak but one dish in Marriage , it shou 'd beyond all controversy , be good Temper . -- If you have seen Mrs. Garrick since she returned from Sandleford , she will have told you how pleasantly we paſsed our time there . I need not tell You , who know her so well , how inexhaustible are Mrs. Montagu 's resources for Conversation . I think I scarcely ever met with any human being who brought so much Mind into Conversation , and one may justly say of her what Johnson says of somebody else that she never opens her mouth but to say something . -- Apropos of greatneſs and goodneſs combined , how does our excellent Mrs. Delany ; I tremble to hear of her having the slightest indisposition ; I am tempted to wish such people immortal , but I check myself when I consider that there is an immortality awaiting them , infinitely beyond that poor imperfect one , which I am unjust enough to propose as a reward for merit so superlative . I suppose she is gone to Bulstrode , if not pray say something for me to her that is expreſsive of the utmost love respect and veneration , and tell her , if you please , that we spent one whole morning at Sandleford reading her favorite book , Patrick 's Pilgrim ; Mrs. Montagu read it to the Primate of Ireland and me , and we vied with each other in expreſsions of delight and admiration , as well at the grandeur of the stile , as the nobleneſs of the Sentiments . -- I inclose our dear Mr. Walpole 's sprightly satire on Family pride . My time has been lately a good deal taken up with my friends , Lady Bathurst and her daughters , who have been at the Wells ; they are charming Girls , the youngest in particular has uncommon talents , but , with their too natural concomitant , delicate health . I am not quite en état to answer your enquiry about my opinion of Les Veillées du Chateau ; as I have read only the first Volume , and that in a superficial way , as an idle book to divert myself . Instead of answering me by the question , You shou 'd have given me your opinion and that of your friend Stéphanie Félicité comtesse de Genlis , as I dare say you have both formed it murement , and with deliberation : I own as far as I read I was exceedingly amused : That woman has a wonderful talent at keeping up the attention , and of catching hold of the affections ; the most insignificant event grows interesting or instructive in her hands . If however I were apt to read with a critical Spirit , I cou 'd generally raise objections as I go along ; and sometimes pretty considerable ones . There is surely no great propriety in the story of the jealous Husband , in the first Vol : considering the Youth of those to whom it is told ; they either can not be supposed to understand it , or they shou 'd not be made acquainted with the most deforming paſsions in their most terrible exceſses : but I suppose she does it with the same view as the Spartans exposed their drunken Slaves to their children . For my own part I dont like these experiments and anticipations ; and I a m for preserving to children their innocence of all kinds as long as poſsible Adieu my dear friend ! return good for evil , and write soon to your faithful and -- very affectionate Lady Stormont To H.
