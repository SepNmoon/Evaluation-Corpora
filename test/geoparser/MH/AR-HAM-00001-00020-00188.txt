Wilton Lodge 3 d . Septr- 1804 My Dear Sir It is certainly very abominable in your precious Rib to agitate your Nerves , by such Tantrum 's as You inform me of , and I hope the Medical Gentlemen at Cheltenham may punish her for it , as She deserves . I beg You will not permit her to escape from them , till they force her to be good , and to promise to desist from such Pranks in future . As I still bear a degree of Christian affection towards her , I do hope , the Cheltenham Waters may repair the mischief She has done herself by pretending to vomit black bile . Had she not known that She was out of the reach of my personal rebukes , she would not have ventured to have tormented You so . Caution Louisa to avoid her Mother 's bad example , and aſsure her Mother that I will not forgive her , if she ever ventures to give herself such airs again . Ever My Dear Sir , Yours very Sincerely Napier Madam , My Sister , That you had not written to me , did not surprise me , because I know your Naughtineſs . But , that You should presume to be ill , without asking my Leave , is quite intolerable . It is therefore my positive commands , that You regain your health with all poſsible expedition , as You value my future good will . You desire to know about me , and mine . It is , however , so long since we have had any communication with each other , that I find it difficult to know , at what part of our history , I ought to commence . Perhaps , you never heard that my eldest Son , this time twelvemonth , announced to me his disinclination to becoming a Nabob . I am not quite sure , that I did not approve of his sentiments , not being violently attached to the Indian Tribe , at the same time , I felt that if he could creditably raise himself to independance , and restore the broken fortune of his family , it would be a desireable circumstance . As he did not seem to feel this , I acquiesced in his wishes , and gave up the Writership I had secured for him . The question then was , what was to be done with him ? The Dragoons , or the Navy -- which I pleased . To the Dragoons , I had many objections , first , because , I could not afford to purchase promotion for him in that line , & secondly , because I consider that branch of the Military Line , as a mere nest for idleneſs & diſsipation . He did not like to serve in the Infantry ; but having early had an inclination for the Navy , it was resolved that he should be a Tar . Accordingly , last October I shipped him at Leith in La Chiffonne Frigate , going on a Cruize to the Orkneys , from whence , he was to be conducted to Yarmouth , and re=shipped there to join the Defence of 74 Guns , Captn- George Hope , off the Texel . The latter ship he reached the beginning of December last , and has been blockading the Dutch , till the end of July , when his Captain sent him home to me , to get a little better air , in order to remove a periodical headache , which was considered to be agueish . He has had no return of the complaint for upwards of five weeks , and he is now preparing to return to the Texel . For that purpose , I take him to Edinburgh on Wednesday . He is a great tall , lank figure of six feet , tho ' not eighteen , and to compleat his beauty , he has light red curling hair , like a Mop . He & my Nephew Sedley are just gone to fish for Pike , in a Loch ( anglice , Lake ) seven miles off . As you may not exactly know who my Nephew Sedley is , it may be proper to tell You that he is Son to Mr. Sedley of His Majesty 's Bedchamber , who is brother and next heir to Lord Vernon . Young Sedley is the husband of Miſs Warren , only child of Sir John B. Warren , whose Wife is my Wife 's youngest Sister . ( I hope , this will sufficiently instruct You in the family Pedigree ) . Sedley , his Wife , and Young Son , are now with us , and I am sorry to say that we shall lose them on Wednesday , as I like them much . I had a very brilliant Court at Edinr . last May , which proved £100 more expensive , than last Year . I am told , that Government have it in contemplation to add to my Salary , as Commiſsioner . Out of £1500 , the expence this Year cost me upwards of £990 . When I got the Appointment , I was told that I could clear from 7 to 800 pr Ann : Adieu My Dear Sister . Maria joins me in everything kind to You & Yours . Love to Louisa , & best Compts- to My Countrywoman . Ever your Affecte- Brother Napier
