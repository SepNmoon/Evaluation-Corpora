Septr . 1779 -- 6 th . Monday Morng . -- My ever dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , Must I am afraid have been struck I am afraid that when I wrote this Morning I was a little hurt at her behaviour last Night , it is true I am I rather will say , was , very much so , you have taken but very little notice of me late , if I have been at ye . Window you have pretended not to have see n me , however yr : kind , friendly , & informing Letter this Morning has almost set my mind quite at rest . How little must you know me if you think that I should hate you for shewing me my faults in the true lights which they deserve . no by Heavens I esteem you , I admire you , I love you ten thousand times more on that account . I never thought of making a laughing stock of misery tho ' it appeared so to you by what I said ye . other Evening , but it was merely to try if I cld .. rouse you by any means , for you appeared so exceſsively low , and so cold to me , & shewed it so publickly , that I cld .. not imagine what I had done to cause yt .. alteration in yr . behaviour , but now I hope I may attribute it to ye .. presence of M.—— F.—— You say you do not think you say that what she said about you was her own private opinion , but that she thought it neceſsary to conform herself to ye . opinion of ye . Ton . sometimes that B o uffoon A——d says a tolerable thing amongst a wonderful number of low , vulgar things , & quite unbecoming his Character of a C—— & this is one of the tolerable one 's , that he never believes people have more sense that what they apparently make use of , so I say , that I can not believe but that these must be her sentiments , as ſhe chuses to adopt them , in leu not only of more humane , generous , & true one 's . As for ye . Character & Portrait you was so good as to send them to me I do not think that they are a favorable likeneſses , however upon ye whole I think they are rather characatured , but not quite in ye high style of William Arnald I will ye . first moment I have a little time send you ye . Portrait & character of rather a tall , broad shouldered , manly looking man who has a consummate share of impudence , who is attached beyond what words can expreſs to ye . young Lady w hose Portrait you sent me yeſterday . Tell me in yr . next if you are not satisfied with ye . frankneſs and openeſs with which I not only lay open my whole heart to you but my whole Soul & with ye . true confidence & friendship which I place & ever will do so in you , continue to treat me in return in ye lik e manner , & believe O my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend , that I shall be unto my last moments Yr . M. F . toujours de meme . P.S . I send you Myrtles to day & Umberellas tomorrow Adieu , Adieu , Adieu , toujours chère .
