June 5 th . 1782 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton I can not look at your three interesting Letters without longing to thank you for them , & aſsuring you of the pleasure they give me ; but I feel I am punishing instead of rewarding your kindness , by intruding on your time without a probability of saying one word that can either interest or amuse you . Dear Mrs Carter I have just been with to condole with her on the Loſs of her Friend Mrs Pulteney , wch . She is much hurt about , I told her I shd . write to you today , & she desired her Love . Her Conversation & Friendship is a are delightful Circumstances in my Situation , & the former such an Appendage to Deal Castle , as I think no other in ye Kingdom can boast ; as to the latter , thank God , that can not be confined to place or time , but looks ever to Eternity , for virtuous Friendship surely outlives the Grave . I am glad you recd . the Letter I meant to meet you at your return from Windsor , but am sorry it found you so unwell , I suppose from this Influenza , that has turn 'd every place into an Hospital . thank God we have escaped here , thō many have been ill at Deal . My Son 's Arrival was indeed a most joyful Event to me , I am glad he is thought to look well , he seem 'd eſsentially so , thō he was not quite free from Cold , his Stay was short here , but he says he will visit me again . I am afraid poor Made . de la Fite does not gain ground , it really will be unfortunate for the Summer Studies , if she shd . remain an Invalid , & very distreſsing to herself , as She will be situated . My Spanish Reading is the same I fancy as the Queen 's in French , if so , tis very entertaining & interesting . I have had Visits to day from some of our great Sea Commanders that are return 'd from blocking up the Dutch in the Texel , a great Event to me such Visitors , who literally know not a Soul in this place but Mrs Carter & Mrs Drake , & the latter has been long confined with Illneſs . If ever you hear our Names here mention 'd let me know , & in what manner our Stay is talk 'd of . I rather suppose yr . Ansr . will be that you hear nothing abt . us . The Child certainly mends , therefore I conclude they will continue him here . Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton , how I have run on ( just as I shd . have talk 'd ) to the 2 d Side of my Paper . I need not use many more words to I hope to convince you how unwillingly I quit you even when I am without a poſsibility of a Word in return . Yrs . ever
