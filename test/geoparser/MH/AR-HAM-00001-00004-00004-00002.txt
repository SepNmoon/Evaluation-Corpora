Windsor 26 th . Sept . 1782 Highly grateful as I was my Dear Uncle for the Affectionate proof of your regard on your recollection of me in so melancholy a Season , I was too much shock 'd and afflicted to be able to send an immediate acknowledgment to your letter -- I mourn the death of Dear Lady Hamilton with ye . sincerest sorrow , for I was attach 'd to her by the liveliest gratitude for the kind consideration she treated me with even from my earliest days of recollection , I weep also for having lost a person whom I loved from inclination , & whom I admired & esteem 'd for her Virtues -- I feel for you my Dearest Sir -- I can easily judge what you must have suffer 'd , & I am fully sensible how irreparable is the loſs You have Sustain 'd . “ The Death of real and Virtuous friends is one of ye . heaviest trials of this Uncertain World , But it is a delightful consolation when they leave us poſseſs 'd of all our Esteem , and that our thoughts can follow them with joyful hopes of their complete happineſs . ” Source not yet traced . This consolation is Yours -- this comfort You have , & it will support you to bear properly the deprivation of a happineſs in the Society of one that was so deservedly dear to you . Their Majesties have expreſs 'd themselves in the kindest manner upon this Melancholy Subject , they spoke of Ldy . H : in ye . highest terms of Commendation , they desired to see the letters You had written to me , which after they had read they both said how much they felt for you . May I take the liberty to hint ( if you make me happy by answering this ) that You will take notice of their having interested themselves in Your Affliction .
