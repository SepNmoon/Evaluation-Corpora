Kew . Frid . morn . 4 th . Octbr . 1782 If I recollect aright I promised to lend to Miſs Hamilton Sr. Jos : Reynolds discourses , I have therefore sent them to her , & make use of the opportunity to enquire after her health . I must beg to trouble her also to give the enclosed note , with my best Compliments to Mrs. Hagerdorn . Miſs Hamilton will be good enough also to present my best Compliments to Monr . de Luc , & to inform him that I received his books of which I will take all imaginable care : I have not yet been able to make much progreſs in them as during the Prince s two last visits at Windsor , I was absent from Kew . The Port Folio of Drawings arrived safe . I am obliged to Miſs Hamilton for her kind Letter & beg leave to subscribe myself her Much obliged most obedient humble Servant J. Fisher P.S . My Fellow Labourer is considerably better . All Sun Shine chez nous .
