Mr. F. Hamilton to his Brother ( 17 7 6 6 ) at Northampton from Ipswich Dear Brother , As we have now been here near a month I may venture to affirm that I have at last fixed upon an agreeable place , for so I find Ipswich in every particular . The country about it is charming & the air remarkably good . The people are remarkably sociable , & have been almost unanimous in showing us every poſsible civility , this I attribute in great measure to my friend Mr. Charles Hamilton who has a very good Estate in the neighbourhood of Ipswich & who made it his busineſs to recommend me very particularly to every Person of consequence in it . Having now no expectations of further Preferment I do not mean to make any more expeditions to Ireland with my family , as I find the expence & trouble of moving too great , when my Affairs call me there , I can go over for two or three months at a time alone , without very great inconvenience , & if I can be allow 'd to enjoy what I have in this way I shall be perfectly satisfied . Finding it impoſsible to get Lodgings that can be put up with , I have already purchased a neat small House & Garden in the best part of the Town which I intend as a settlement for Mr. Lloyd in case of my death as she can fix in no place with equal advantage , & if fortunately that event is prolongued only a few years it will I hope be very suitable to her finances , in the mean time it is a very comfortable residence for us both , the purchase with furniture & c amounts to at least £ 700 which will oblige me to observe a very strict oeconomy for some time . I shall be very happy to hear of your having taken possession of your new habitation & that you find it perfectly to your mind ; Mrs. Hamilton gave me , the other day , a very satisfactory account of it ; for being particularly connected with Ld Orwell , he has been very frequently at Ld Hallifax 's . Ldy . Ann Jekyl called upon us here last week & confirmed the news of Ld . Beauchamp 's having succeeded his Father as Ld . Lt . of Ireland if I cou 'd ever be certain of any thing , I am sure he is totally unqualified for that Office , he owes it intirely to Ld . Bristol to whom he has pay 'd court for these ten years past . Pray remember us to Ld . Chatham & Mrs . , my Wife has been confined all this day to her bed by a violent sore throat , a disorder very frequent here at present as well as fevers . Miſs Hamilton i s tolerably well & desires to be rememberd to her friends at Northampton Adieu Dr . Brother believe me ever Yours most Affectionately Betty Ipswich September 28 th . 1766 . Suffolk
