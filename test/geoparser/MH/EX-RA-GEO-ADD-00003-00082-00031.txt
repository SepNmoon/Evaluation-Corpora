My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , You should not put too much confidence in yr . eyes , if from my gaiety last Night you suspect I really was so , you are much mistaken , for I never was in lower spirits in my life , I was obliged to act a part , I thought it wld .. please L—— C—— F—— if she saw me so , and as it is but so seldom that I ever pay her a visit I intended to appear as un usually elated , as I judged it wld .. afford her & her D——s satisfaction . What had I to make me so , ye . first thing , you appeared quite out of spirits , ye next ye . intolerable pain I suffered , and a certain degree of fever which attended upon it , both which I now have , & ye . third for some time being separated from you for how long I did not know , seeing you , and not being able to converse with you . I own I was not a little surprised excuse me , my friend , at ye . extraordinary coldneſs , & let me add another Epithet to it , unfriendlike coldneſs with which you treated me , I am afraid you must have heard some more evil reports to which you have given too easy a hearing , wherefore let me once more say , that as our Almighty Father is my Judge I do not remember to have said any thing more to Wm .. R . than what you know already , can I be more explicite , plain , and open . Yr . conduct last Night hurt me more particularly so , as I had expected you wld .. have received me ever dearest Friend , as you had acknowledged my innocence in yr . last , with open arms , excuse ye term , but I have nothing strong enough to expreſs ye . happineſs I proposed to myself when I was to have met you , but Alas ! how little are men in this World to trust too much to any thing . I entreat of you my sweetest Friend to explain ye . motives of yr . conduct to me , if it originated from mine I will allow considering ye . friendship you have for me , that there were some grounds for it , as I had promised you not to conceal a thought or a secret of my Soul from you as I know you never reveal what I say , nor take any notice of it notwithstanding yr . little unkindness & méchanceté to me , yet as I hope never to forfeit my word to you indeed to any body , but most especially so to you , I will now relate to you what paſsed between me & a fashionable or rather bonton Lady Yesterday Evening . Upon my first arrival after I had paid ye . customary & usual compliments to ye . Company , I went up to pay my particular respects to this Lady , some little time , perhaps some two Minutes or there abouts , having first complimented me upon ye . dreſs of my hair , ye cut of my Coat , ye . size of my Buckles tho ' not quite large enough , ye . cock of my hat , & in short , on my air degagé , & saying that ye whole “ Upon me huner was quite comme il faut , she thus began “ Have you learned to be very discret a quality “ which all such Beaux as yrself & yr Brother learn nowadays “ as ye . first & principal thing to constitute a Macceroni of ye “ first Claſs , such as yrself , & Brother , if you have , but indeed “ yr . Brother says you have so at all ventures I 'll trust you ” then after a few Seconds had paſsed in her recollecting herself , I suppose you then entered ye . Room my Back being turned to you I did not see you , if I had I shld .. immediately have flown up to you rather than have walked up to you , but from ye . abrupt manner of her beginning I suppose it was then you arrived “ Oh ! Lard I had most forgot to tell you something , well then this it is “ but youl promise me not to be angry , because pozz positive if ye are I never “ will tell e any thing any thing again , it is about yrself , now don t “ be angry ” , in this manner my dearest Friend she continued “ extorting aſsurances of secrecy from me for some time , at last I prevailed on her to continue in ye . following manner “ Now . “ ye promise me not to be angry for to be sure I ſld .. be very sorry to “ make ye so , Ill begin , know then that as I was upon yr . B——d—— “ in ye Evening on ye T—— at W—— a Beau came up to me & took two “ or three turns with me , & we paſsed y ou e , y ou e was then walking with Harriet Finch -- That can not be true for you know you went after ye first sound home to yr . own Room , being very sick he then said to me Lard who is M—— “ H—— walking with I wld .. nt offend ye “ ye know , I pertest I never saw in all my life , if she be a friend of yrs . “ ye know I wld .. nt offend e ye know , so ye must know , the creature actually “ said he never saw a plainer Girl in all his life you know , so he asked me ye know ( I hope ye are not angry ye know , ) for it is meant all in good part ye “ know , so I answered him , Lard no , so he asked me ye know who the “ Girl was , so I answered him , ( I hope tho ' y ou e are not angry for I only “ presumed upon our old acquaintance ) so I answered him to be sure there “ never was a sweeter P—— ever born , but I can aſsure e ye know he “ doesnt like her , her name is H—— H—— shes about his Sisters a “ Gentlewoman of a very good family , but to be sure ye . know she 's very “ plain ye know now I hope ye . are not offended , I know quite contrary “ he 's an extraordinary good taste ye know , but , e has'nt bin much “ about in ye . World ye . know , & so he has'nt seen many Ladies comme “ il faut ye know , & therefore does'nt know who to speak to & “ who not ye know , ( I know ye pardon my impertinence , ) but he 's “ so affable ye . know he 'd speak to any body , but by and by ye . know “ says I , he 'll be ye most fashionable Man ye . know in all ye town . “ Now I hope you 'll not be angry , for tho ' perhaps she be a friend of “ yrs . you know I cld .. not help it -- I trusted to our old acquaintance “ There she ended , I then turned upon my heel & left her . And is it thus in courtly life ( he cries ) That Man to man acts a betrayer 's part , And dares he thus the gifts of Heaven pervert Each social instinct , & sublime desire , Hail Poverty ! if honor , wealth , & art If what ye great pursue & learn 'd admire Thus diſsipate & quench ye Soul 's ethereal fire ; James Beattie , The Minstrel : or the Progreſs of Genius ( Book I 1771 , Book II 1774 ) . From ye . Minstrel , or Progreſs of Genius . D r . - Beattie . Stanza 22 , Book 2 d . You know how I love , esteem , & adore you , can you therefore suppose that this conversation was pleasing to me , I own I could scarce restrain myself from saying something or other very rude to her . Tell me my ever dearest friend , you will ever to yr . dying day continue mine , reiterate to me that you esteem me , that you do not hate me , I can not help confeſsing you made my heart bleed , you draw tears from me by yr . behaviour . I was quite disappointed , appear to me always , show me ye . open heartedneſs of a Friend for ye . future in yr . countenance , what an unpleasant Night have I paſsed ! I was glad to quit my Bed to take up my Pen in order to ease my mind , inspire me once more with that comfort , which yesterday evening you destroyed . You seemed astonished at ye . Bow I made M—— H—— but it was only in answer to ye . very ridiculous Courteſie ſhe made me , I can never esteem her it is now impoſsible . You told me you had got something in yr . pocket to make me laugh , I you said you wld .. give me it me , but you did not think I deserved it , I know I am undeserving of every thing mark of kindneſs you shew me , yet my friend , allow for ye giddineſs , unguardedneſs , & fire of Youth there is no knowing what follies one may commit Yet they are not committed intentionally , & when one has such a friend as you one never can be at a Loſs of for ye best advice that can be given , & for ye truest marks of friendſhip which sympathise in every misfortune that befalls one . I will confeſs myself to be foolish , unguarded , & even rash at times , yet I have a heart , which is capable of receiv e ing ye noblest sentiments , & which really I hope , at ye . bottom is a thorough good one . This I hope will be a strong advocate in my favor with you , & will counterbalance I hope Ye weakneſses which I ascribe to myſelf . Continue , O continue continue , I beseech you my friend , give me fresh aſsurances no , I need none , I know you so well , that it is folly in me nay it is worse it is distrusting you . Treat me with the same confidence you have hitherto done , I never betray e d you , tho ' I spoke unguardedly about you once that was to Miſs F—— & that was for ye first & shall be for ye . last time . Tell me in yr . next you are contented with my frankneſs , that you esteem me as much as ever , & then you will restore peace happineſs & comfort to my distreſsed mind . Adieu my ever dearest , dearest , dearest Friend , not hing can ever exceed my affection for you , may you ever prosper & be happy is ye first & last Prayer of Yr .. W—— R—— . toujours de même . P.S . I thank you for ye Book I admire it very much I have very near finished it , I have but a few leaves to read , I particularly admire ye . paſsages you have marked , you convey yr . advice most delicately ; I have tried to correct with my utmost endeavours ye foolish & wicked custom of swearing , & I hope I have succeeded in it , & I am endeavouring to cure my ſelf of making use of my honor , in a light , silly , & trivial way , which ought to be so sacred . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu -- tout ce qui m'est cher au monde .
