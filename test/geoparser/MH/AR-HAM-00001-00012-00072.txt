Windsor Septr . 2 d . 1781 Till I have ye . happineſs of seeing you , my Dearest Ldy . Charlotte safe again in England I shall have fears & Apprehensions -- but my Apprehensions about you & Ld . Winchilsea are so much leſsen 'd that I feel I can now addreſs you with greater ease of mind and Satisfaction than I have yet done -- Your last Letters have afforded us the greatest comfort . Pſs .. A . & Miſs G—— having made it their busineſs to inform you of every thing paſsing in this family , I have deem 'd it unneceſsary -- I had written a long account of all our arrangements at this Place but I found you had already been made acquainted with them , Miſs G . having sent you the information during my Illneſs . I have a thousand things Notwithstanding to say to you , but I feel so hurried , so unsettled , so certain of interruptions that I know not how to begin or when I shall be able to end a Letter . -- Septr . 3 d . you are by this time Acquainted with Miſs G . Illneſs , she has been confind above a Month -- tomorrow she intends taking her waiting , I have taken the Advantage of their M . with Pſs . R . & A . being gone to Moor Park , Sr. Lawrence Dundaſs 's , to begin again writing to you . it may appear improbable but I declare my time has been so taken up this summer from before 7 in ye . morng . till ½ past 11 at Night , that I have not known what it was to be quite alone -- judge my Dr . Ly . C—— whether this was favorable for writing . -- Ldy . J. Penn has been twice with their M . ; Yesterday Eveng . , and Saturday she was at the Lodge -- She looks perfectly well & appears in good spirits -- to day she quits Stoke & intends settling in Town . I must tell you a little Anecdote of Pſs . Mary -- when Lady J. P . came last Night , Pſs . M said “ I am glad Ldy . Jully is come , ” one of her Sisters told her she ought to call her Lady Juliana -- Oh says she “ I do n't care how I call her -- God bleſs her -- I love her , she is so like Dear Ldy . Charte . -- & Pſs . Sophia , who is my great great favorite , says Ldy . Chte . is very ill Natur e d to stay so long ; & is continually enquiring after you . I deliver 'd your Acknowledgements to ye . P. of W . enquiring after you . and he again order 'd me to present his love to you . he has begun Shooting and is very fond of it , this Morng he was going to set out as we went to Chapel -- he has quite left off attending divine Service on Sunday Morning 's their M & ye . Princeſses attend both the Chapel & Cathedral -- the K has fitted up a Closet in the latter -- We had an excellent Sermon Yesterday by the Bishop of Landaff his M . residence at W . -- and strict Observance of public worship , has the good effect of making the Clergy very attentive to their Duty . This , one of the Prebandaries told me . During the time the K . f was absent with ye . P. of W . viewing the fleet -- Lady Dartrey had the honor of being the Queen s Guest at W . her M—— seems much pleas 'd with her -- & expreſs 's her approbation of Ldy . D—— 's manner -- & c. & c. -- though it was certainly a pleasure for me to see Ldy . D . & be under the same roof with her for 6 Days , I had not the Comfort of enjoying one single instant 's private conversation with her nor were we once alone together in a Room ; She is quite recover 'd and I never saw her better -- I believe she was as much pleas 'd with the Visit -- as she must be highly flatter 'd by the invitation . Princeſs R . and I agree perfectly well together & things go on much better for ye separation . -- You know we are quite to ourselves in the Upper Lodge . -- her R. H . constantly attends her M . to Kew & London -- we now go but once a fortnight -- Pſs . A & E . have gone Occasionally when Miſs G . was too ill to dine with them ; last Week Pſs . A only accompanied Pſs . R . Pſs . E . was indisposed -- their M . went to the Play & we slept in Town on thursday . the Q . did not take the Pſs 's . to ye . Play , it was the Beggars Opera , & she thought it an improper representation for them to be present at . if Lady Weymouth had been well enough their R : H : were to have paid her a Visit , but as that was not the case , the three eldest Miſs Thynnes came to them . on friday Afternoon Lady Weymouth was brought to bed of a fine Girl & is as well as poſsible . My Letter will be written like paragraphs in a News-paper -- You must excuse the Stile the Writing -- the faults -- I am so determin 'd not to lose the present Opportunity that I scribble away as fast as I P oſsibly can & put down what presents itself first to my thoughts -- the Communication of which I think you may like to have . Mrs. Walsingham charg 'd me to tell you & Mrs . Fielding how much she felt herself interested about you , & Ld . Winsea- . She has been settled about 3 weeks at W . I have not yet had it in my power to pay her a Visit -- only call 'd in twice for a few Moments & then her M . was so good as to send me -- she is quite well , & has regain 'd her Spirits -- she does not yet make her Appearance upon ye . Terrace , or pay Visits -- but she receives Her friends in an Even.g . Mrs. Newton & ye . Bishop of Bristol never fail writing when I come to Kew to enquire if there have been accounts from Lisbon -- indeed my Dearest Ldy . Charlotte it would considerably lengthen my Letter were I to mention all those who make enquiries ; & whom I am persuaded are sincere in the regard they profeſs , & respect they have for you . & who is there that ha ve s the least knowledge of your Character that would not respect You -- & surely none that have the happineſs of your Acquaintance but must have the highest regard for you -- how much then must those feel who are bound to you by gratitude , or honor 'd by your Friendship . -- Often , very Often , do I think over the Time I spent last Summer -- the recollection always affords me a sweet satisfaction -- I enjoy your society again in Idea & I endeavour to banish the Remembrance of all the Unpleasant Events that have since happen [ ' d -- God grant this severe trial being happily over & Ld . W . being as it were restor 'd to you , the remainder of your days may paſs away without one event to Cast a Cloud over them or disturb your serenity . 4 th . Septr .. Miss G . desires me my Dear Madam to tell you she has not been able to write for more than a fortnight the Complaint on her Chest & a perpetual Blister , from which you know she always suffer 's so much , has render 'd it impoſsible for her to stoop to a writing table -- she is now pretty well again & comes into waiting this Eveng . -- Next Week she will write to you . I have enquired & do not find that any one has Mention 'd any-thing of ye . P. of W 's Birth day -- my talent does not lay in describing well ; therefore you must be content with a simple Narrative of what was done : We made our appearance at Chapel in the Morning , the Gentlemen wore the Undreſs Uniform -- the Ladies Hats -- smart Poloneses -- the Hair well dreſs 'd white Cloaks , & c. -- each dreſs 'd agreable to their own taste except the Prinſs's- Princesses , who all wore rose Color trim 'd with Gause . Lady Courtown & Lady Egremont breakfasted with their M . & the Royal family -- P. of W . also breakfasted with their M : after B . their was a General separation -- I believe dreſsing chiefly occupied the time till 2 O'Clock when We all aſsembled & attended their M . through a prodigious crowd of people to the Castle -- we went to the P. of Wa——s 's apartments , his , own , which are now fitted up in an Elegant and proper Manner -- his R : H : was not ready to receive their M . but all his Lords & Gentlemen attended in due form , after some time he enter 'd & then ye . Regiment quarter 'd at W . ( Lord Fauconberg s ) were drawn up before ye . Windows & ye . usual ceremony of firing & c took place : Her M . made ye . P . a very fine present of a single Brilliant for his Stock -- at 3 O'Clock their M . return 'd to ye . Lodge -- the P . 3 Princeſses & 4 Princes from Kew , Duke of Montague Lady Egremont ( who had been some days in ye . Lodge ) & Ldy . Courtown din 'd with ye . K . & Q . Ld . Courtown gave a Dinner at ye . Round Tower to all the P of W . family , some of the K—— 's that were at W . & a few strangers , there were 33 in Number . Windsor was so uncommonly crouded that they could not find accomodations for half that came , & those that did find accomodations were obliged to pay at an Enormous rate . all the P . trades-people come from Town & were at ye . Expence of an Elegant Dinner at so much a head . At 6 O'Clock we went to ye . Castle -- to those Apartments their M : always s e in -- in ye . first Room was a Concert , perform 'd by the Queens Band -- Bach , Abel , & c & c -- . and the German Band , this lasted till 8 O'Clock . -- To our great comfort , but to ye . Disappointment of many Hundred people , we did not walk upon the Terrace -- the R , F . only made their appearance at ye . Winders . the Wind was remarkably high , which I believe sav 'd us this additional fatigue -- indeed how we could have walk 'd I know not , for ye . concourse of people was so great that there was no Visible space between them . at 8 O'Clock , their M . 12 of ye . royal Children -- ye . Duke of Cumberland -- Prince Ernest Augustus ; Gentleman & we other proper attendants went to ye . Audience Chamber -- the doors of the Presence Chamber , where the Company were Aſsembled , were thrown open & as they enter 'd were spoke to by ye . P their M . then went into Her M . 's Drawing Room ( which was ye . Ball Room ) & they began Dancing , in the K 's Public Dining Room , which open 's into the D—— R . was Tea & c. & proper Attendants -- the whole of ye . King s Apartment was open & Card Tables in each Room -- at a little after 12 we went to Supper -- I wish I could convey a proper idea of the very brilliant & magnificient appearance of St. Georges Hall which was the Supper Room -- it put one in mind of descriptions in ye . tales of the Genii -- ye . King 3 Pſs's- Their M—— & Ladies of ye . Bed . chamber sup 'd at a Table under the Canopy at ye . upper end of ye . Hall , they being rais 'd so much higher than ye . rest of ye . Company were seen -- & could see to ye . best Advantage . on each side , the whole length of ye . Hall , they being rais 'd so much higher than the rest of were ye . Tables for ye . Company -- one for the Chaperons ye : other for ye . Dancers -- ye . P . sat about ye . middle of ye . latter , with P. Edward on one side & one of ye . Ldy . Ldy . A. Campbell s on ye . other . In the Gallery at the lower end of the Hall were plac 'd the German Band & they play 'd all the time we remain 'd at supper , which was near two hours . I believe there was as many people to wait , as persons at Table -- the Supper was perfectly Elegant , the fruits & wines remarkable fine , in short , the whole was perfectly Right & every body was pleas 'd . the Ball concluded at 6 in ye . Morning . I inclose a list of ye . Company . The Dancers wore Poloneses -- the other Ladies Negligees without long lappets . Murray the Princes -- the K . -- D of Cumberland D off Queensberry All Lord Ailesbury Gentlemen & those belonging to ye . R—— Family wore the Windsor full Dreſs Uniform -- ye . P . the Queen & her sisters wore different color 'd Clothes , trim 'd with silver , & were all very fine I think my Dr . Pſs . Royal I have not forgot any circumstance relative to this important Day . -- I have some fears that you will find what I have written tedious -- and Unentertaining -- if it should prove so I beg you will let the intention plead my Excuse . Lady C . desire her Compts . and charg 'd me with a thousand fine speeches but I really did not comprehend them sufficiently to commit them to paper . She is better than I have ever known her -- takes long walks -- dines every day with Mrs. Schwellenberg & me . -- and has been at Windsor all the summer . By this time I hope Dear Mrs. Hagerdon is safe with you at Caldas -- I am very happy she likes my Cousin -- Mrs . Fielding expreſs 's equal pleasure at having had an Opportunity of knowing her -- Mrs. Graham has got a 3 d . son , she has been brought to bed , near a fortnight , is quite well , & nurses the child herself . I beg my Affecte . Love to Lady Stormont -- a very Saucy young Man takes ye . Liberty of writing to her , & insists upon my sending What he has wrote -- as you will see it first -- I venture to obey his commands -- Adieu my Dear Dear Miſs Finch I love & respect you more much more than I can expreſs . Lady Charlotte M. Hamilton is gone to Margate for a Month , one of her Children has a humour in her Eye . She has taken ye . three with her . Duplicate Copy of one of my letters
