Office I went to the Marine Barracks at Stonehouse -- where there is a very fine Band of Music much boasted of -- Unluckily for me it was Muster Day & no Music -- I went a little further to the Lancashire Barracks & then returned to Dock to take my place in the Mail for Bath which is the best Conveyance to Clifton & was disappointed as they could not promise me a place before 4 OClock & then it is uncertain -- & during my walk the other Coach was gone to Exeter & so here I am beguiling the time in writing my journal & scribbling to you -- I must get away to night if poſsible as my purse is low & therefore I desire Louisa will send me 5£ & if any body chooses to write to me -- direct the letter to Coll . Hamilton 's Clifton -- I have not Money to convey me to London as I believe I should go home without stopping at Clifton -- I was a little provoked after I got to the Comr s . yesterday to have time to read a Newspaper before the family entered the room in Driblets consisting of Adml . & Mrs. Stopford -- Adl . & Mrs. Martin & their Daughters & Mrs . & Miſs Fanshaw -- The party was very pleasant & I staid till 11 after finishing & losing 2 Rubbers -- Mrs. F . asked Ad .
