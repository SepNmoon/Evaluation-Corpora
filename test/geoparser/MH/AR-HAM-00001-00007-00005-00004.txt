My dear Miſs Hamilton If it was not so late I should call on you with a long Meſsage from Ly D . but as it is I shall write you the Purport of it . viz -- that She wishes you could dine with her on Saturday at 3 o'clock , & go with her to their new Purchase after Dinner ; If you cd . not on Saturday perhaps you cd . on Sunday do n't trouble yrself to answer this to me as I shall not see her before the time , but she begs you will send her yr . determination as soon as poſsible . Yrs . most sincerely S. Feilding I hope you have been well entertained with the Play & its Spectators -- Ldy . D . cd . not write herself being much hurried with having Mrs. Earle in the house . I conclude you know all that Story & there is nothing new to add upon it but that She has had a 2 d . Letter from him rather more satisfactory than the first & 2 d . tells her where he is Wednesday night Miſs Hamilton
