Albemarle Street March 9 th . 1786 My dearest Mrs : Dickenson Ten thousand thanks for your comfortable letter , which inform 'd us that your excellent husband was arrived safe to you , & that he suffer 'd no more from the strain , my Mother & Mrs. Lenton both desire me to thank you for them , I am much flatter 'd by my good Brother s kind expreſsions of regard for me , give my love to him & tell him his joy at seeing you was so great , that I fear it has made him very absent , as he directs his letter the second , & you the fifth ; Be not uneasy my kind friend about my health , I am upon the whole very well , sometimes complaining it is true , this cold weather agrees with me & when settled weather comes I make no doubt but I shall recover my health again . On Friday I was at Mr .. Hamilton 's there was a very elegant & polite party , The Duchess of Bedford & two neices , Lord & Lady Stormont , Lord & Lady Cathcart , Sr. James & Lady Wright Sr. Charles & Lady Thompson , in all about seventy people , Miſs Hamilton & Miſs Mathews were the only singers , the Former was dreſs 'd with the greatest taste & elegance , & look 'd very pretty She sung divinely , she this year far exceeds Miſs Mathews , their were five instrumental performers , One ( I can not recollect his name ) was a very pleasing agreeable & rather a handsome man , I must tell you a Story of him which I am sure must give you pleasure , some years ago ( perhaps seven or eight ) he went to Holland to follow his pro ff f eſsion as a Musician when there a Lady of family & great fortune fell very much in love with him & made proposals of marriage to him , in case he would give up his prof f eſsion , which he very readily did , they were to have been married in a fortnight when she fell ill of a fever & died , but during her illneſs she made a will by which she leaves him every thing she had in the world , which was very considerable indeed , as soon as she was buried , he sent for all her relations , ( for she had several who though people of fash i on in Holland were very poor ) he read the will , & as soon as he had finish 'd he divided every thing equa lly amongst them , only keeping for himself £200 a year a diamond and another ring & her picture , he return 'd to England to follow his profeſsion , & he is very much careſs 'd & noticed ; I think it is as great an instance of true & real generosity as I ever read or heard off . Pray tell my Brother that I am grown so great a card player that I have an invitation to a small party at cards for Sunday sevennight The answer I return 'd was , that I was sorry I could not wait on the Lady on the 19 th .. as I never play 'd at cards on a sunday evening , do you not think it was highly improper to send to a young person , tell me if you think my answer was proper . I have not heard from Mr. Collier which I am much surprised at , a thought came acroſs me yesterday , which I thought I would communicate to you , which is that I should like to ask Mrs. Cartar s op p inion , she is remarkably clever , & I would as soon trust to her Judgement as Mr. Collier 's or any body else , tell me what you think of it , I will always consult you before I take any new steps , therefore after you have thought seriou s ly about it , write me word what yr op p inion is . -- A. Maria din 'd here yesterday , she is much better , but looks rather thin , she left us to go to Mrs. Vesey 's to meet Mr. Walpole . Sally has call 'd here , She wishes to know when you will send for her , as she could have a place now , & she does not like to be so long out of place , Indeed I wish you had her as I think & hope she will answer to you , she wish 'd me to write , & she will wait for Your answer . John went to Grimwoods the price of the French & english Gorze or furze Seed is two & nine pence a pound but if any quantity is wanted two & six pence a pound . Mr & Mrs .. Cole call 'd the other night , they spoke as every body else does well of your good man . Tell him we miſs him a little bit .
