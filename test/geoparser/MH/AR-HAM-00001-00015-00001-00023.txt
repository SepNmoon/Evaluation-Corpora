Horton August 11 th 1787 -- I received your long expected and wished for letter two Days after I had written mine , so that my dear Friend tho ' I am very grateful for it and that it made me very happy , you will recollect that you still owe me a long letter , & will now owe me two . I should have increased your debt to me sooner , but I have been from home , & when at home , have been as lazy and idle as heat can make me . your letter indeed short as it was , was a great relief to my mind , I was grown very anxious about you , & the more so as Lady Wake whom I had seen two or three times , was in the same ignorance of about you , as myself -- thank God all your anxieties are over as well as mine -- Mr D . quite recovered , & your little Louisa got over inoculation , which indeed there was little doubt of , but yet it is a comfortable thing to know that she runs no longer any risk of infection . Pray my dear write to me on the subject of your plans for the Autumn & of the probabilities of my seeing you here , for as for any of your being in London , I suppose there is leſs chance than ever of it since your family is increased . Ly Wake tells me that that she reckons upon your coming to spend sometime with her -- when will that sometime be ? can it not be managed so as to succeed a little sometime here ? I have told you when I shall be here , & that I will change my fortnights , if I can by so doing poſsibly catch you here -- pray my dear Friend turn over all this in your mind and do what you can for us . I am very well indeed notwistanding what I suffer from the heat -- Bell has been confined to her bed these two Days with a violent fever , which is howeve r thank God not attended with any alarming symtoms she is just got up & I am writing in her room -- she desires her kind love to you , & begs you to come my Brother is at this minute at home , but is going into Herefordshire in a few Days -- we spent some very pleasant days last week at Wakefield with Ld and Ly Euston who are both charming People so happy , so fond of each other , so contented to live alw ays in the Country upon a very small fortune -- I hope it will soon be somewhat increased by their coming to live entirely at Wakefield , I shall be delighted to have them so near us -- I had not seen her since her Marriage , and hardly knew her , or could discover any traces of her former beauty , so exceſsivly is she altered -- but she is altered likewise and improved in her manner & disposition , & grown vastly pleasing & interesting . we dined with Ly Wake last Saturday -- she was then very well but has since had a bad cold which prevent ed her coming here to day , I think Miſs Wake improved in her manner & looks -- she is not in good Health tho ' & eats nothi n g -- we have a little addit t ion to our family , & a great one to our occupations & amuseme nts in Mr Digby 's little Girl , whom we all wished to remove from an infected air & a scene of misery & confusion , where she could not be attended to & whe re her Health was sufferi n g -- she is a sweet child as to disposition and very quick -- poor Ly Lucy is dyi n g & in the m os t cruel manner -- Mr D . left her only for a few hours to deposit his little Charge here I pray every day for her release , nobody was every better prepared in every sense of the word , for another world & I fear much that Mr Digby will suffer eſsentia lly from his wonderful attentions to her -- he scarce quits Ly Lucy an hour in the 24 nor has done it for Months , & that he should not yet have sunk under the weight of such continued anxiety of mind , is not a daily subject of astonishment to us -- consideri n g too the infected air he is confined to , & that he is accust om ed to take a great deal of violent exercise -- I was interrupted in my letter yesterday by the obligati on of dreſsing to receive some neighbou rs who dined here -- the Mansels amongst others -- She has always been my aversion -- thank God it is over this is Sunday & I am concludi n g my letter before Church -- Bell is a little better -- the fever is gone but a headache and languor remain , which are disagreeable symptoms , but I hope they will go off -- Have you met with the Lounger a new Scotch periodical work ? it is abused , but I think there are some charmi n g papers in it particularly all those signed Z. read it -- adieu my dear Friend , God bleſs you , remember me to Mr Dickenson -- & write soon -- adieu ever affce : & c CMG -- To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire 11 August 1787 Honble Miſs Gunning
