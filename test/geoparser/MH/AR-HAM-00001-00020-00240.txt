71 , Queen Street 27 th - Decr- 1809 My Dear Sister , I can not pretend to condole with You on the death of Your Uncle Frederick 's Son . It is an Event , which , from the unfortunate situation he had placed himself in , can not be much regretted , further than what must be felt for every one , who misconducts himself . There being no Children is a very fortunate circumstance . But , I trust , your Uncle will do something proper , to prevent the poor Danish Woman from being driven to act improperly . My old fashioned Notions lead me to conceive the Marriage binding , in the sight of God , though it may not be strictly so , by the Laws of this Country . She , could not be acquainted with them , & having married in her own Country , ought not to be left destitute in this . I observe that your Cousin the Viscount 's family have put on Mourning ; but , I did not chuse to talk to them about the Cause of their dismals . How thankful ought I , and mine , to be to a merciful Providence ! My Son Francis , is a Midshipman , on board the Huſsar Frigate . You may conceive what has been our Suffering , till the falsity , of the Report relative to it , was ascertained . For three days , we had no hopes ; but , now our Minds are set at rest . A friend at Guernsey , the moment the Report reached that Island , wrote to tell me that the Huſsar was safe , at Anchor , there , and that my Son was in perfect health , I had likewise accounts from the Admiral ty which quieted our Apprehensions . My eldest Son , now a Lieutenant in the Navy , has been with Us , for these last two Months . He leaves us this Afternoon , in the Mail , having received an Order to join the Kent at Portsmouth , without delay . He will make a great blank in our Society , from which he had been absent between five & six Years . We may , however , be satisfied that we have had him so long amongst us . There is the advantage of Miſs Children . They stay at home with their old Parents , till they become old themselves . I expect to be kept awake , when I am sinking into Dotage , by the amiable Clack of my four Virgins . At present , it is quite the contrary , for they usually gabble , till they put me to sleep after Supper . Your Louisa is a quiet good sort of a Soul , and not inclined to be over Garrulous , which is something extraordinary , considering who brought her into the World . I must , at the same time , allow that Mr. Dickenson has infin ite propriety of all sorts , & improved the Hamilton Breed . Adieu , My Dear Sister . My Rib joins me in every kind wish to You , Mr. Dickenson & Louisa . Best Complements to my Countrywoman . Tell her , the Sun shines bright here today , & there is no Snow . Perhaps , the Apples may ripen next Year . Ever your faithful Friend & Affecte- Brother Napier Edinburgh , Twenty Eighth December 1809 Mrs- Dickenson 49 , Welbeck Street Cavendish Square London Napier .
