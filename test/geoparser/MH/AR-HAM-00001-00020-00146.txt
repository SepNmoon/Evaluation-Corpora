I will allow that You are a good Creature , for making Me the pretence for Your gadding abroad . The Archy Cathcarts have likewise had the humanity to quit the Country , and are now in Town . The He one , I have seen , and live in hopes of soon being introduced to the She one . Since I wrote to You last , I have had a very comfortable Dinner , at the Greville Mansfields ; and on Wednesday , I have a Card to feast with the Portland Place Mansfields . The Lord of Cathcart , is confined to his Room , with a violent Cold , or Gout , and the Lady of Ditto , in attendance at Windsor . I , inadvertently , and in disobedience to your commands , betrayed your intention of being here to Lady Mansfield . But , as your determination , on that point , is fixed , it is not of much consequence . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Best Love and Affections to the Leighton Houseites . Ever Your Affecte Brother Napier To convince You that I have Wafers I shall now make use of one , though the practice is filthy London , Eighth April 1799 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds .
