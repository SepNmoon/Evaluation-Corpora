I am more vex 'd than I can expre≈øs to hear that you have been here two or three times without my seeing you , & I will not trust to Mrs Hamilton s Memory to tell you so , I never heard of your being here once , till yesterday when I was not up -- & really began to think that you had given me quite up -- a thought which was truly mortifying to me -- I likewise never heard of yr being here the day Ld Abercorn was but it seems you did not ask for me -- or I am certain Every one in the House is so certain that I always am happy when you will call upon me that they would never think of denying me to you -- You Must excuse this Scrawl but I am so hurt at these Mistakes that I can not be tolerably easy till you know that I am not in fault whatever you might think of me . I should think sadly of myself if I was not ( which I really am ) My Dr Brother your Most Affect . & Sincere Friend C Hamilton Honble Mrs. Wm Hamilton now Ladyy Hamilton to Honble Charles Hamilton about 1766 .
