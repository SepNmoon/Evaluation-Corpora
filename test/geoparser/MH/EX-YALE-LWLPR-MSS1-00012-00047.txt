how very kind , my dear Madam , in the midst of your own Anxiety , to think of mine ! I am as much obliged to you , as if you yourself had cured Mrs Delany ; certainly recovering I trust she is , & that you will be rewarded by enjoying her again -- but I fear you will dread London , after being received by such alarms about her & yr Daughter , who I hope remains quite well , & that she & you may live to Mrs Delany 's age & be as much beloved . yrs most & c HWalpole To Mrs Dickenson
