Wilton Lodge 5 th . Janry- 1805 My Dear Sister , If I tell You that when your Letter arrived this Morning , I was actually meditating the fabrication of one to You , You will have the saucineſs not to believe me . Therefore nothing more shall be written on that Subject . Your Letter is written with so much Spirit , that I am convinced of your having regained your health . You must not expect anything entertaining in return , for my thoughts have been occupied & harraſsed with Bonds , Bills , & Mortgages ever since last September , when two Irish Gentry came over from Dublin to settle the Claims against me , on account of the ruinous nineteen Years Lawsuit . After many Pro 's & Con 's , between my Law Agent & these Vagabonds , I have compromised matters with Mrs- Evans , for the enormous Sum of four thousand Guineas , in full of all her demands on me for Property of her Sister s which came into my hands , Interest on it , and Costs of Suit . They insisted on my paying down £2000 instantly , & took my Bond payable in Septr 1806 , for the remaining £2200 . I was fortunate enough to procure the immediate loan of £2000 , and so got quit of the Harpies , for the present . But , as a day of reckoning with all my Creditors must arrive , it became neceſsary for Me to consider , by what means , I could satisfy all their cravings , and none has occurred but the Sale of this Place , and that has been determined on . My intention has been notified in the Newspapers , and I go to Edinburgh on Monday , to settle all the neceſsary Arrangements for the Sale . You know , I have been kept with my Nose to the Earth by pinching poverty , all my Life . The step I am now about to take , will , I trust , clear off all my Incumbrances , personal & hereditary , or will nearly do so . My personal Engagements are about £9500 ( including the Irish 4000 Guineas , & £2000 borrowed from the Trustees to compleat of my Marriage Settlement to compleat the purchase of this Place ) . My entailed Debt is now reduced to £2448 . Wilton Lodge has cost me £6000 , and it is considered that it will bring me now from Ten thousand Guineas , to £12,000 . I do not allow myself to be sanguine , and shall therefore not count on more than the 10,000 Guineas which will pay off all my personal obligations , and leave £1000 in my pocket . If , however , £12,000 should be obtained , it will make me more independant . No man alive abhors being in debt more than I do , and to find myself once free from it , will be to arrive at great felicity indeed . You may naturally suppose , that the Resolution of quitting a Residence where we have lived happily & comfortably for upwards of fifteen Years was not fixed on without feeling a few pangs . But , Maria & I are both convinced that the measure is proper , and will eventually be advantageous to Us all . Having stated all this to You , it is but fair that You should be informed , that the Leases , of my Entailed Property in Selkirkshire , expire at Whitsunday 1807 . That Estate is now let at £748 pr- Ann . , and will certainly double its Rent . Two of those farms , now let , the one at £200 , and the other at £80 , I have already been offered £540 for . My plan is , when the new Leases are let , to appropriate a Sum annually out of the encreased Rent , for the purpose of paying off the £2448 , still remaining for my Grandfather s debts , so that I may transmit it clear to my Son . When I got the Estate , it was under £500 pr Ann . & was answerable for nearly £6000 of my Grandfather s iniquities . By taking advantage of the Act of Parliament for redeeming the Land Tax , I reduced that Debt to what it is now ; & purchased the Land Tax , by selling a detached farm of £130 pr- Ann . for 4000 Guineas . If Wilton Lodge produces £12000 , that will enable me to pay both my personal , & my Grandfather s debt , without waiting for the arrangement I propose for the payment of the latter , unleſs it should be deemed more expedient to purchase a House for my family in Edinburgh . As I did not go to Parliament last Seſsion , I think of attending my duty some part of the ensuing Session , but can not fix the time , till I have arranged my other matters . My daughter Mary accompanies me to Edinburgh . She is going , for a few weeks , on a visit to Lady Anne Stuart , daughter to Lord Moray , where she will have an opportunity of going about a little under the care of Lady Grace Douglas , elder Sister to Lady Anne . I am glad the Fox Hounds are sent off . I hate the name of them , ever since I read the barbarous Story , in the Newspaper , of their having been permitted to devour a Fox , which after having given excellent sport , had returned & taken shelter in your Court Yard , from where it had been turned out in the Morning . Had I been present , I would have endeavoured to have saved poor Reynards life , perhaps , at the risk of my own . I never saw Garrick , nor shall I attempt to see the Young Roscius in London , not wishing to be squeezed or trampled to death . You was fortunate in not meeting with Lady Aldborough . Every body speaks well of Mrs Holman , & I am grateful for her recollection of Me . I wish her brother would get himself quietly hanged before he becomes Earl of Selkirk . Arch . Cathcart informed me of his Yorkshire Living , which is somewhere near Ferrybridge . He is not a bad Man , though I hate Dragoon Parsons . Give my best Love to Mr. Dickenson ( in spite of the Fox ) , and to Louisa . Maria joins me in wishing every thing good to You & Yours . Remember me to my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister , Your faithful friend and Affectionate Brother Napier 34 each } Side } 19 bottom 19 Do 8 Hawick , Fifth Janry- 1805 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
