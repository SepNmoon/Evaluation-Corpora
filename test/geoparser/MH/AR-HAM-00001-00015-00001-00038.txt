St James 's Dec : 10 th I have just received your second letter my dear Friend which indeed most justly reproaches my silence , but if you knew how I have been plagued & tormented to death on vario us accounts & by various circumstances you would be very indulgent & make even more allowances for me than I do for myself . I received your first kind letter at Richmond near a Month ago -- & thank you most sincerely my dear Friend for all your kind wishes for my happineſs -- I came from thence to Town to attend the Queen to the Play , the first time the dear King had been there since his illneſs -- nothing I can say , can convey to your mind a just idea of the joy , applause & acclamation with which we were receivd , it was the most affecti n g thing I ever saw -- the whole House which was fuller if I may say so , than it could hold , sung 6 times over God save the King -- this they repeated as often last Wednesday . I have been at St Leonards for ten days & for this week past in Town , every day intendi n g to write to you & every day being prevented you will believe how impoſsible it has been to me to find a moment 's leisure when I tell you that not to speak of many of my other Friends to whom I have been shamefuly remiſs , I have never yet written to my Friend Mr Young to inform him of my intended marriage , you may imagine I have this much at heart & yet I have never yet found the moment , I have been tormented to death about Houses seen a hundred , all too small , s o dear , dirty or too far from my Father , you have no idea of the difficulty or the price -- at length we have been reduced to take a neat shell in South Audley Street for a year ready furnished , it is very clean , comfortably , nicely furnished & gives us time to look about us & fix upon a comfortable habitation for life -- Mr D—— had been very unwell for a fortnight the Gout flying about him -- he is quite well now , & goes on Monday in to Somersetshire to carry his Children to Ld Ilchester s for th e Holydays -- he returns for new years day & I believe the marriage will take place on some of the early days of January . I can now tell you that Miſs Digby a daughter of the Dean 's & niece of Mr D . is to succeed me -- it is a very kind at the same time a very proper mark of the Queen s regard for Mr D . she is very pretty amiable & bei n g one of 11 Children it is a very eligible situation for her -- I have as yet told you nothi n g of my Health which is now perfect ly good thank God & has been so for these 3 weeks or Month past -- I rejoice extreme ly in the information you gave me of Mr D . have given up Taxal to you , I think two the c i rcumstance of two families in a H ouse always a very disagreeable one , howeve r well they are united , besides that you had really no room to see or receive you r Friend 's a comfort one can not dispense with if one lives the whole year in the Country -- you flatter me with the pleasur e of seei n g you in Town -- when will it be ? n ot till the spring I imagine -- My Father is not very well & Bell has I think lost her good looks & Health since she left Margate -- My Brother at Paris & very well -- remember me kindly to Mr Dickenson -- & love to Louisa who I hope improves in everythi n g that can add to you r comfort & happineſs -- God bleſs you believe me ever affec : & sincerely C. M. G—— To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
