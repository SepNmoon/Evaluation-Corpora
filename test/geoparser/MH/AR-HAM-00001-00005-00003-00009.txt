Gt Cumberland Street June 15 th - 1810 Dear Sir I am obliged to you for the intimation convey 'd by your note of yesterday , announcing the arrangements respecting Mrs. Holman 's funeral , in consequence of Mr Hamilton 's directions to Mrs. Mann , & the desire of its being private , has prevented my offering my Carriage to attend , which I should have be glad to have done -- It certainly has not been my Wish , to mark in you , that want of attention , which you hint at in your Note , but certainly We We were not a little surprized , at the sudden intimation of Mrs. Holman 's death , without having heard the least Account of Her previous illneſs , from any quarter , & which illneſs , I was afterwards sorry to hear , had continued painfully , above Thirty days -- It has been a great satisfaction to us , as it will be to all the Family , that Every Medical Aſsistance which could flatter hopes had been called in on this occasion , & tho ' the Case has unhappily been too baffling for their skill , We should , had We known of it , have indulged in those recollections , which in their direction , might have shewn , that We could not have been wanting to Ourselves , nor to Mr. Hamilton , at this period of extreme distreſs -- I remain Dear Sir Your Faithful Humble Servant Robt : F : Greville .
