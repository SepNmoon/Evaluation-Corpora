Wilton Lodge , 1 st : Febry= 1790 . My Dear Sister , Tho ' I am not displeased at Taxal being your own , yet I can hardly bring myself to say , that I rejoice to hear of the Old Gentleman 's present to Mr. Dickenson . Had you been Wanderers , we might have seen you here , whatever may be our inclinations , our neceſsities will not admit of our moving , as I can not leave my Farm , not Maria her Nursery . These being the Days , in which , Independance appears to flourish more than in former times , that I may not appear absolutely unfashionable , I will force myself to congratulate You on the late addition to your Comfort , & I will add ( You may beleive it or not as You please ) that I love the Master of Birch Hall for shewing Attention even to You . You may laugh at my Masonic Dignities & amuse yourself with running the changes on Levels , Mallets , Chiſsell 's & c ; but alas , my elevated situation , like most other Scrapes in which I have been engaged , has been attended with an infinite degree of expence & inconveni e nce . Fifty of my good Pounds go to aſsist the building of that College , the foundation of which I so happily deposited last November . In return for my Cash , I have to boast of having received the Freedom of the City of Edinburgh & the Degree of Doctor of Laws from the University . I honestly confeſs , that I could have expended my Money in Stone & Lime , much more to my satisfaction at Wilton Lodge . Had you seen , with what becoming Gravity , I addreſsed myself ( in the middle of the Street ) to the Magistrates , and afterwards to hte Profeſsors of the College , you would certainly have experienced those feelings of Awe & Veneration , with which , the admiring Mob were so deeply penetrated , that during my discourse not a Word was to be heard from the collected Blackguards . In my more early days , I was not entirely unknown to the Populace , who ( poſsibly ) poſseſsing more real good qualities , than those who call themselves their Betters , are willing to allow them , still retained such a recollection of our former friendship & intimacy , as to abstain from bestowing the usual Salute of dead Cats , Dogs , & c. & c. for which due credit was given them in the Edinr . Newspapers . The public appearances I have made as Grand Master , & the Speeches I have uttered before crouded Audiencies , will be of use on preparing Me to hold forth in the Great Aſsembly of the Nation , should the Peers be so silly as to send Me to Parliament , at the next General Election . As an Orator , Burke is a joke to Me , & Sheridan unfit to hold a Candle . My Eyesight is still much impaired , I suppose by Age & Infirmities . I begin to have serious intentions of purchasing Green Spectacles . My Nose , was by nature designed for such ornaments , & if ever I reach the Senate , they will add to the appearance of Wisdom , which I ought to be at some pains to affect , being thoroughly conscious of not poſseſsing the reality . Not having any Royal Dukes in our Neighbourhood , I have been obliged to submit to baptise my little Girl , in a more humble way than some of her Relations have lately done to their Infants . What is still more , for want of a Clergyman of the Church of England , I even condescended to make use of the Minister of the Parish , & strange to tell , my Daughter was Christened by the name of Anne , without the Assistance of Godfathers & Godmothers , I myself ( according to the forms of the Presbyterian Church ) taking upon Me all those Vows , which Sponsors never intend to fulfil . Do not from this circumstance , imagine that I am an Advocate for the Repeal of the Test Act Wilton Lodge South Front In the Center , below stairs , a Hall & above the Hall two Dreſsing Rooms . Behind the Library , a Dining Room ; behind the Nursery , a Housekeepers Room . Behind the Family Bed Chamber , a Drawing Room ; behind the best Bedchamber , another Bedchamber & Dreſsing Room for Strangers . Five Rooms in the Atticks , three of them for Strangers & two for their Servants . My own Dreſsing Room is on the same floor with the family Bed Chamb . A principal Stair case & a back Stair . A row of Offices joining the main House , containing a Servants Hall , Cellar , Kitchen , Scullery & Washhouse ; Above , a Laundry Maids Room , Housekeepers sleeping Room , My own Man 's Room , & Footmens Room -- The House likewise contains , Butlers Pantry , Milk House , Larder , Water Closet & divers other conveniencies . The stables & c are good , but being in front of the House , must be removed when we find Leisure . You would like the place , for it is really comfortable & pretty . The neighbourhood , not too numerous , but desireable . We live in a quiet way & pay our Bills . My plough horses match those I have for the Coach , so that occasionally we can drive four . I have taken it in to my head to fancy that I like farming & as I never had any particular reason to rejoice in the Military Life , I feel no regret from quitting it . Adieu . Maria & the Brats well . She joins me in affectionate wishes to You , Charlotte & Miſs . Ever Yours faithfully & sincerely Mr. Dickenson Napier Taxal Chapel le Frith Derby By Carlisle .
