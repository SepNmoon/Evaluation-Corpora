Clifton June 5 th : 1781 My Dear Miſs Hamilton This is the first moment I have had , to tell you , that after the hottest , & most dusty of all Journeys , we are arrived , I bleſs God , safe and well , at this beautiful & delicious Spot . I do not wonder that Mr : Brown call 'd it the Garden of England ; -- it appears to me more beautiful than ever , as I never happened to be here , just at this Season . I am lodged quite to my hearts ' content in a quiet retired Spot ; I have a House ( thanks to my Indulgent & generous Husband , ) quite to myself it is shaded on one side by Trees , belonging , to a Place House built by Sir Wm : Draper ( of these Trees perhaps I shall tell you more presently ; ) & on the other side there are Hay Fields , where we spent some hours in the Evening , when we do not take the Air upon the Downs ; & nothing can be more delightful . Julia -- who was sadly heated by the Journey ( but as patient as a little Gellert . ) seems quite refreshed , & to have regained her spirits -- patient little Creature ! she had two Blisters with the violent heat upon her Lip ; & she never once made a Complaint 'till we came to Bath , & when the Coach stopp 'd ; She looked up , with her cheeks quite scarlet , & beg 'd to know whether she might be laid down to sleep upon a Bed -- there is no describing her moving Face , & pathetic tones of Voice -- pray forgive me for this Anecdote ; I think you will do so , without my asking it : my cough is better today ; but I still cough at times -- but I trust this fine air , & quiet will soon set me quite up . I am so happy as not to have any acquaintance here , to hinder my perfect enjoyment of my Children , & myself -- I have one Friend ( who is worth all the Acquaintance I sd : be likely to have here ) in Mrs : Quin , the Sister of my Dearest Husband . She is here for her health ; but and I do not think her well at all : She has great strength of mind ; an uncommonly good Understanding , & an affectionate warm heart , without making half the profeſsions , that people who feel little often do . -- She has none of the gentle , manners ; or tender feelings of her Brother ; but is as nobly generous , & as warmly liberal , as he is . I was interrupted here , & upon returning , I can not help smiling to see what an Eloge I have wri tten upon my Husband -- it is well I am writing to a Friend . pray let me hear from you soon ; & write me a long Letter ; I took this morng : to write to you , that I am prevented taking the Waters , as it is not right , to hold down the head long after drinking them -- so you must only expect Scraps for the future . As I write to you with my heart in my hand ( as Mrs : Burrows says Mrs : J. Pitt talks , ) I must now tell you , that the sweet Trees I mentioned , are thickly planted round a Monument , raised by Sr : Wm : Draper to the memory of the Officers who fell in Asia 1760 -- we have to this House a Porch ( an old fashioned seat at the Door where I indulge myself every Evening sitting , & overlooking this beautiful & melancholy spot , & thinking of my sweet dr : dr : Richard -- I paſs in my mind , as quickly over as I can , the sad hours I watched him , when he was here declining day after Day -- & endeavour to raise my mind to what I trust he now is , an Angel -- a bleſsed Spirit , out of the reach of Sin & Sorrow ; & you can not imagine how much good this seems to do me -- & I trust it will -- I have If you hear any thing of Dr : Ly.- C. Finch & Lord W . pray let me know ; I sent the last account I had to Miſs Goldsworthy -- I sen d t you a verbal Meſsage , as I really had no t time to write -- I hope Her Majesty does not suffer by the hot weather , & that the Princeſses are well -- If they ever mention me , pray present my duty . & tell them how sensible I am of their gracious attention to me . Adieu my D : Miſs H . I expect a long Letter in answer to this immediately -- Yrs : sincerely PD -- June 6 th : I hear from Mrs : Hattons a tolerable acct : their me from Lisbon -- I have had no Letters -- June 5 th - 1781 To Miſs Hamilton at the Queen 's Lodge Windsor Direct to me at Clifton near Bristol I heard from Lord D from Holyhead -- I hope to he ar from Dublin soon --
