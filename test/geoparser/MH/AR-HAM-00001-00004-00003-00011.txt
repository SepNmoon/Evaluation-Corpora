London December 21 st : 1787 . My dear Cousin / I had the Pleasure to receive your Letter a little while ago , for which , I thank you . You give a very satisfactory Acount of yourself , of Mr : Dickenson , and of your little Daughter ; and mention a Design , which I hope you will not be prevented from putting into Execution : I mean that of visiting us in the Spring . I long to be introduc 'd to my pretty Cousin . By the Bye , you never told me whether she was like you , or Mr : Dickenson . I have no Doubt of her being a very good little Girl , though if you do n't spoil her , you will have great Merit , for Children at her age , are so engaging , that it is difficult to refuse them their own Way in almost any Thing . I shou 'd make a pretty Governeſs , you 'll say . My Brother is plac 'd much to his own satisfaction , as well as to that of my Father and Mother . How long he will remain Abroad , is uncertain . I shall not fail to tell him when I write , that you , and Mr : Dickenson , desire to be remember 'd to him./ My Sister is at present at Nancy : she rather chose to spend the Winter there than at Geneva . She lodges in the same House with her Friends Mr : & Mrs. Foster , who are Abroad upon a similar Plan to her 's -- Œconomy . The last letter we had from her , said , that she and her Children were well , and that she lik 'd her Situation./ We are in great Confusion , just now , as we remove into our new House to-morrow . It was to have been ready for our Reception , at Michaelmas last , but Builders hardly ever are punctual./ I shall keep your Engravings for you , till I see you , as they wou 'd make too large a Packet to put into a Frank : besides , folding them , wou 'd injure them . We were very glad to see Mrs : Preston , though only for a few Minutes , one Morning . I think her a very agreeable Woman . So you are to spend some time with Mr : and Mrs : Daniell , next Summer : I dare say , it will be a pleasant Visit , for Mrs : Daniell is a most amiable Woman./ I am very busy , ( or rather have been , ) learning a Part which I am to play , at the Duke of Richmond 's Theatre . It is Isabella , in the Comedy of the Wonder : I say I have been busy , because I know my Part pretty perfectly now . I have rehears 'd several Times , and hope to acquit myself well ; as I have been receiv 'd in the handsomest Manner poſsible , by all the Parties concern 'd . The Play ca n't be perform 'd till about the Birth-day , because the Duke means to have a new Theatre , which wo n't be finish 'd sooner . I have seen Mrs : Siddons two or three Times this Season . She has been indispos 'd , but is pretty well now . I like Music as much as ever ; and hope you will find me improv 'd , when you hear me sing . We have had no Music Parties yet , this Winter , because we have been in such Confusion , and Busineſs , relating owing to the new House./ My Father and Mother beg to be kindly remember 'd to you , and Mr : Dickenson . They are much pleas 'd to hear that you are all so well , and that you are so happy . This Letter will reach you in proper Time , for the Direction on the Frank is right . I do n't know how I came to be so stupid as to mistake your Direction , when I wrote last./ Adieu my dear Cousin -- Give my Compliments to Mr : Dickenson , and believe me your 's affectionately J : Hamilton .
