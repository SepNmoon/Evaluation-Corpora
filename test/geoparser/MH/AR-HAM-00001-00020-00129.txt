Wilton Lodge 13 th . Novr . 1794 . My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 2 d - Inst . has arrived safe . But , no Deeds or Conveyances have yet made out their journey hither . Pray pull the Lady 's Cap ( her Ears if you please ) who has , by her unaccountable daudling , concealed this Paper for so long a time . I have nothing to say to You , but , in obedience to your Commands , sit down to tell You so . Regular & orderly in all our proceedings , one day at Wilton Lodge so much resembles another , that tho ' all the occurrences are wonderfully interesting to the Inhabitants , yet a relation of them would afford no entertainment to others . A O ne great event , however , has this day happened , Maria having again taken her Seat at the head of the Dining Table . She had been in the Drawing room since Monday , and threatens taking a Walk out of Doors tomorrow , or next day . Whether she will execute her threats , I know not , but as You Females are tolerably inclined to have your own Will , perhaps she may . After all this , I need hardly tell you that she is very well . The little Boy sleeps & sucks wonderfully , and never squalls but when they torment him dreſsing & undreſsing . Would I could say , all my Brats were equally quiet . But , alas , in spite of the terrificability of my Countenance , they will indulge their own little Paſsions , & distreſs my Nerves , by irritating mine . As I suppose Louisa never treated You in this way , Mr. Dickenson & You may scarcely imagine the thing to be poſsible . But , he only poſseſses one part of the complaint in the Song , a Scolding Jade . The satisfaction of Six Squalling Brats is now nearly added to Me , five being quite perfect in the Art , & the sixth will of course , if he has any imitative powers , soon learn to join their Chorus . And now My Dear Sister , having inked so much of my Paper , for which you are to pay Sevenpence , I will endeavour to add one solid declaration to all the Nonsense I have written , which you may believe to be sincere , and that is , that my most affectionate good wishes ever attend You , Mr. Dickenson and Louisa . Maria desires to join hers , & so pray take them . Ever your faithful & attached Brother Napier . P.S . Pray dont forget me to Miſs Morrison . Wilton Lodge 14 th - Novr- 1794 . This letter was sealed last Night , & I have opened it again to tell You that Your Settlement after Marriage came to Me by the post this Morning . It should have been returned this Evening had You condescended to give me any Instructions on the subject , but you have not told Me whether I am to sign seal deliver & return it to You , or whether it is to remain for preservation in my custody . If the latter , it should also be signed & c by Lord Mansfield -- I observe , only one Witneſs to your Signatures . Inform me whether any more is required when I sign . In this Country we never use leſs than two , and sometimes three . I likewise apprehend , room out to be left above my Signing & c for Lord Mansfield to do the same . Send me an answer to all these queries , by return of Post . Mrs= Dickenson Birch Hall Manchester by Carlisle
