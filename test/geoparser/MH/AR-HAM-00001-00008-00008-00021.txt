x 8 Typed To Lady Wake Clarges Street 15 th . Febry 1785 What excuse shall I make to you my Dearest friend for so un un common a silence , it is true I have been constantly engaged -- I never spend a whole day at home & every Morning has been much taken up wth . people coming to see me , this however wd . not have prevented my finding time to write to You -- but when I tell you that my Mind has been in an uncomfortable unsettled state you will readily believe that I had reasons for not writing -- I did not like that you should find out that I was unhappy -- & could I disguise my feelings to you ? But as the cause of my unhappineſs no longer exists I can now write to you with pleasure . I was sorry to hear from Dr . Lady Dartrey last night that there could be no certainty of your coming to Town as Sr. William was still too much of an Invalid -- I suppose you know -- I went wth . Lady D—— to Texier s & that we were much pleased wth . his Translation of ye . School for S c andal -- I also went wth . her to see Mrs. Siddons in ye . Maid of Honor & last night we went to see Macklin perform in ye . Merchant of Venice & Love á la Mode , how I wish you had been of ye . party You would have been delighted to see this Stage veteren in his 85 Year performing keeping up these Characters to admiration -- See the power of love ! what think you of that sensible amiable Miſs Cooper combating wth . him for 8 or ten Years & at last forced to own his sway publikly by marrying Monr . de Luc , he is a fortunate man , I have no doubt but that she will be happy as he is to my knowledge quite a good creature ; he will nurse her wth . ye . greatest tenderneſs -- & except when ye . Q or Madame SSchwellenberg requires his attendance never leave her a moment . Miſs Gunning is in great Beauty this Winter & has been wonderfully well -- Bell is vastly ill , but is so fortunate as to look in high Health , grow fat & is able to support Balls Aſsemblies Operas & c & c night after night -- is not this an extroadinary state of health -- for she has no appetite , no sleep no spirits sufficient for existance -- you ask me for folio letters -- did you see ye . Packets I am obliged in charity to send into Derbyshire you would not be so unreasonable -- Mr. D has had a thousand vexations since we parted & he tells me my letters ( & c ought I not to give credit to what he says ? ) keep up his spirits -- our affairs are going on -- but when all matters will be settled God knows -- patience is a great virtue & I hope Mr. D . will lay in such a stock now that it as will serve him all his life . Mrs. Vesey told me yes terday that Lady Clermont told her that ye . Dſs . of Devonshire was again Pregnant & that she meant to lead a sober quiet life this Winter -- If our People of ye . Bon-ton go on as they have begun there will be a scarcity of them next Year -- judge -- this week there are 5 Balls running each to begin after great Aſsemblies -- Almacks besides -- & 6 & 7 o'Clock in ye . Morning is ye . hour they break up -- the P . selects & invites the Company either from ye . Opera or an Aſsembly -- I take care to keep out of ye . way as I am not desirous of being one of ye . chosen . -- You did not tell me whether I might put Your name down as a subscriber to ye . Poor Milkwoman s Verses wch . are to be published this spring , pray inform me -- ye . Sub : is a Crown . Mrs. Carter is much as usual always tormented wth : an headach we never meet without talking of you & she desired when I wrote to send her affectionate love -- the Glovers are all well -- the Dear old Man never fails when I am there drinking your health . Lady Stormont and her Children are well -- I live a great deal at Lord Stormont s -- She leads ye . most exemplary life of any Young Woman of fashion in London I think Lady Dartrey never look 'd better than she has done this Winter -- I fear she will lose them her good looks during ye . absence of Lord D -- as she will have many apprehensions abt . him -- Julia is delightful as to Temper -- manners & c & c but she grows thin & & though in health appears very delicate , Master Dawson is astonishingly tall & is a little encreased in bulk -- he grows every day more & more like his late Brother . Mr. Antrobus ( tell Mr. C : this ) is in perfect health & as lively as a Bird at full liberty -- he looks ye . picture of happineſs & good humour . Are Dr . Marianna s complaints leſsen 'd ? I must sincerely hope not only that they are but that her health is perfectly reestablish 'd -- My love to her . & Charlotte . have you detirmin 'd abt . Charlotte ? I say nothing on yt . subject as I am not able to advise . remember me kindly to Sr. Wm . & Mr. Wake -- Adieu -- do not punish me for having been so long silent -- you know my Dearest friend how much I love You & that my heart must cease to beat ere my affection for you can be leſsen 'd . Ever Ever Your faithful & most afft . fd . M : Hamilton Lady Wake Courteenhall near Northampton
