Burley . Decr . 27 th . 1777 -- My Dear Miſs Hamilton , Thō a very few days will probably give me a better Opportunity of thanking you for your long-expected Letter , yet I must avail myself of the first in my power , to aſsure you of the pleasure it gave me , thō it told me one Circumstance I am truly sorry to hear , that of your having lost a Person that was dear to you ; which is a Loſs in my Opinion the most to be lamented , as it can the least be repaired . I thank God all my Comforts here of that kind , are in perfect health ; & in their Society , I have paſs 'd a happy & chearful three weeks . My time now draws near a Conclusion , but I look with great Pleasure to the hopes of finding all I I am interested about in Town , as well at my return as well as when I left them . I wrote my thanks to the 2 dear Princeſses by the last post enclosed to Miſs Goldsworthy , wch . I hope have been received , & beg you will present my Duty to them , & Love to her , to whom from the hurry of the Post I could make but a Short Letter . Many thanks for yr kind Congratulations on Lord Winchilsea 's Account , & accept his thanks also . Mrs. Feilding is rejoiced that you have enter 'd on a Study , wch . She hopes will be as interesting to you , as Botany was to her & me We shall revive our attention to it I hope in the Summer , but the present Season invites to nothing that can carry one out of Doors , unleſs we could be inspired with the Paſsion of this Country , wch . is Hunting , & is enjoy 'd here in all its glory . Your Anecdote of the Dutcheſs d'Coventry is very moving , & convinces me of what I always thought , that under no Circumstances , dep a rting from the Truth should be adopted . My 3 little Babes are here as fresh as Roses , & defy all Cold ; if they succeed as well in our Journey , I shall hope to present them to you , much improved by their Country Séjour . Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton & believe that you can not wish me to be more Sincerely & Affly . Yrs . than I really am . C.F . P.S . I am glad to hear Mrs. Hamn . is well & beg my Com̄ps to her . Mrs Feilding desires her Love & Thanks for your kind Letter . Heigth Height
