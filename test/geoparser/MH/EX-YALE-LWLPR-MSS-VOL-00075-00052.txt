Welsbourn Jany 18 1784 . Without meaning any Disrespect to Mrs Astley , I can not tell how to be sorry , Madam , that Mrs Delany has followd his Majesties Example & changed her Secretary , however my Vanity may suffer by it , as I purchase ye Pleasure of receiving ye new Minister s Dispatches , at ye Expence of having my own looked into wth a very penetrating Eye ; tho ' if I were disposed to defend a little Inconsistency ( wch as it looks like a remains of Youth I am half unwilling to explain away ) I should not think it a very difficult Task to do it ; May you long continue to consider a Cold as a serious Distemper , & never be taught by a woful Experience that you are very well off when you have Nothing worse to complain of ; I wish you no worse for your second Charge than that I could give you a Taste of ye Hurries of a Warwickshire Xmas , you would then be convinced yt ye Life I believe you lead , I am sure yt wch I lead in London is Tranquility to them ; As to your last Instance of Inconsistency you will allow when you look at ye Person to whom you are reading ye Letter , that ye Mind does not always grow old wth ye Body , when I am so old as to be insensible to ye Beauties of ye Country & ye Approach of Spring I shall care very little what becomes of me . So much for my own Inconsistencies , what will you say if I presume to think you are not entirely free from them , if you meant to alarm & keep me at Home , you should criticise in a leſs agreeable Manner , or I shall hardly be afraid of ye Criticism or cease to wish meet ye Critic . As I am unwilling to frighten you at your first Entrance on your Office wth a Load of Busineſs , & hope to have ye Pleasure of seeing Mrs Delany so soon , I will not trouble you long on her Account at present , I will only say how happy we all are that she continues so well thro ' so severe a Winter & how much obliged to you for your kind Aſsurance of it , that I expect my Neice on Wednesday , shall set out on Thursday , & look forward wth ye greatest Pleasure in ye Hope of dining in S t James 's Place on Fryday ; yt I will not give her ye Trouble of taking Lodgings for me as I have engaged one at No 20 Cecil Street within two doors of my old one , wch will be ready for me when I come to Town . All our Circle are pretty well , ye dreadful Colds are almost gone , all join in best Love & Duty to Mrs Delany , my Brother Bernard begs to offer his Respects to yourself . If I go on much farther you will say it is very inconsistent I should complain of Hurry & teize you with so long a Letter , In fact I am very apt to forget myself when I am conversing with you , but other Calls will be heard & allow me only Time to add yt I am with great Truth Madam Your much obliged & obedient humble Servant Court Dewes . Dewes Portland Delany -- Port Miſs Hamilton . I send you my letter pray let me have it again to night for I have hardly had time to read it . --
