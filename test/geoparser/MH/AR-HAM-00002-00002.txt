Clarkes din 'd there Il n ' y a rien de plus vî te oublié , qu'une personne qui veut l'être ; son recueillement est la nouvelle du jour , & le lendemain on n'en parle plus . Quand on n'est joyeux que par étourderie ou par occasion , le cœur demeure livré aux remords ou au dégoût . L'amour de nos devoirs nous aſsocie à tous les gens de bien , & l'amour du vice nous mets en société avec tous les méchants . Votre ame ne s'agrandira qu'autant que , fermes sans rudeſse ; économes , sans avarice ; généreux , sans prodigalité , vous ennoblirez toutes vos actions . Prenez garde de vous de dedommager en secret de la réserve que vous ferez paroître : il ne faut pas perdre de vue qu'on doit être vertueux pour soi-même & pour le Ciel , & que l'Honnête homme est celui qui ne craint ni la critique , ni l'examen .
