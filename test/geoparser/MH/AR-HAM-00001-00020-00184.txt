38 , S t . James 's Street 12 th . April 1803 . My Dear Sister , As soon as I received your Letter today , I set out to endeavour to learn what I could about Sir William Hamilton & c. I first tried the Atholls , but they were all out ( by the bye , Lady Charlotte Drummond produced a Son , the day before yesterday , & is doing well ) . Secondly , I went to the Cathcarts , & finding my Lady at home , She told me that Sir Wm . was buried early this Morning , at the same place as his first Wife . He gave directions himself that everything , She had wished , should be attended to . His welch Estate , he has left to Charles Greville & his Heirs Male ; then to Robert Greville & c & c. & c. including Lord Cathcart , & Archy Cathcart in the Entail . The property has debt on it , and is burdened with a Jointure of £800 a Year to Lady Hamilton . I did not hear of any Legacies . As to Lord Nelson , Lady Cathcart said nothing , & I did not think it delicate to ask . The Newspapers , will probably very soon tell you whether he remains in the House with Lady Hamilton . A change of Ministry is believed to be fixed . Mr. Pitt to resume his old situation ; Ld . Melville to go to the Admiralty ; & Mr. Addington to succeed Lord Hobart , as Secretary of State . How the latter is to be disposed of I have not heard . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Best Love to You & Yours . Ever Your Affecte- Brother Napier Mr. Douglas , who married the Nail nibbling Miſs Sharpe , has left his name at my door since I went out . London , Twelfth April 1803 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
