My dear Sir , Your letter that has just now come to hand reduces me to a state of absolute despair ; the continual intense pain that my dear Daugr= has suffer 'd during this calamitous illneſs has brought on a twisting of the intestines , which I apprehend must terminate in a mortification . I now repent not having come to Town at the beginning of her illneſs , for tho ' I cou 'd demonstrate no real intelligence , I cou 'd at least show that my affection is without bounds . I have reason to believe that there is an ample supply in hand to furnish every neceſsary expence upon the occasion , of this Mrs. Mann can give you proper information ; it is my wish that the Physicians shoud be paid most liberally . I must remain in cruel agitation till Tuesday as no Post leaves London till tomorrow . I have not strength but to add , that I remain your most faithful & obliged humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Bath May 2 7 6 th 1810 . John Dickenson Esqr . N o 49 Welbeck Street London May 1810 Mr. Hamilton
