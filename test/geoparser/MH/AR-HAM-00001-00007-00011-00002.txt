My Dear Miſs Hamilton Tho ' Her Majesty in Her great Indulgence & Condescension has forbid me to pay my duty at Windsor ; I ca n't be easy without making this Inquiry after Her Majesty & the Princeſses ; & that you will present my Humble duty & acknowledgements for the Honour they did me . Mrs Delany attempted to write to you to expreſs her gratefull acknowledgements to the Queen , for the magnificent present Her Majesty did her the Honour to bestow on her ; but is miserable to find her Eyes fail her too much to gratifye her sensibility on this occasion ; indeed I think nothing nothing can exceed her gratitude , she was delighted ! with the Elegance & taste of the pocket book & it 's contents ; but when I read the Letter to her ( her Eyes being too weak to read it her self ) she was quite overcome , to receive such a mark of high Honour & great Condescension of Her Majesty ; which she shall ever esteem as a Treasure of the greatest value . I hope very soon to have the pleasure of seeing Dear Miſs Hamilton Mrs D . says in S t James 's place & her kind love I am Dear Madam Your Obliged & Affectionate Humble Servant MC : Portland Bullstrode Decber 16 th 1781 I am ashamed of the Blunder I made to Her Majesty Mrs Delany 's Birthday is the 25 th of May
