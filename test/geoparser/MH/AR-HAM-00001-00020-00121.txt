Wilton Lodge June 27 th - 1793 . My Dear Madam , I had flattered myself before I opened your Letter of a few Posts ago , that I was to be made happy within a short time by the pleasure of a Visit from yourself and those you love best , for , you must know my Dear Madam that I have been anxiously looking out for your arrival ever since the Month of May began ; I say I , because I have been spending a widowed Life from the 24 th - of April , when my Lord left me to take the command of the South Fencible Regt- , & tho ' I regretted his absence on my own account I did so likewise I sincerely aſsure you upon the risk he was running of miſsing a sight of you who , I know he both loves & respects : as far as I am concerned my Dear Madam as one of the causes of your not coming to us just now , if you knew me as well as I hope you may do personally some Day or other , you would observe that I am unlike most Women in my present situation , for I move about , & use the same freedoms with myself I do when free of my present incumbrance , but after the accident you have met with , I believe it is more prudent for once to take care of yourself , as a repetition of these disasters frequently brings on delicate Health . I feel most grateful to Providence for the extreme share of good Spirits & Health I now enjoy which enable me to amuse myself in the way I like best , by being out early & late in the Day at which times the Country appears in it 's highest beauties : in the course of the next Month I suppose I shall be confined , & before that event happens , I trust my Lord will be at home to attend me on that trying occasion , as he has always done . If it pleases God that I should recover from my lying in , I shall live in hopes my Dear Madam to see you & yours at our Farm , for I long to see your Daughter , & I shall at the same time be much pleased to introduce my Children to your acquaintance . I beg to offer my best Compts- to Mr- Dickenson , with every good wishe s a nd to yourself , and believe me my De ar Madam , with much truth , Yr Affecte- Friend & Obedt- Servt- M : Napier . Mrs- Dickenson Birch Hall near Manchester .
