Wherwell -- Nov -- 29 -- I do really think I am authorised to indulge myself in pronouncing to our good Friends in Derbyshire , that Mr- Dickinson 's Prescription has done some good , where He so much wished it to succeed . I can not help attributing to it , the removal & ceſsation of Pain ; but my Father who is always disappointed on every new Tryal , that does not restore him to some more perceptible use of his Leg , is not inclined to allow that it has done much for him , tho He is very grateful for your earnest endevors . He is come down-stairs amongst us , & has a small Bed fixed up in the Library , where his horizontal Posture , which is most irksome to him , but most neceſsary , is continued , except when He is at his Meals . The Swelling of the Thigh is rather leſsened , his appetite is extraordinarily good , & He begins to look as well as ever , & would be as chearful , if He could banish that sad reflection which is perpetually recurring , that He shall never have the use of his Leg . This perswasion keeps him dejected . He has been out twice in the Coach , without any great inconvenience , but in getting in & out , & being cramped by sitting above two hours . -- I really at present think poor Mrs- Iremonger the Worst of the two , She suffers so much from her Eyes . She has at last submitted to a perpetual Blister on her arm , & I am in hopes she will recieve benefit for this a is a melancholy & sore aggravation to her other affliction which was quite enough for her . On her account I wish we were in Town , that she might be in a warmer House , & have the support of more chearing & advising friends . But we can so little judge how equal my Father is to a journey , that I do not see much prospect of our removal . -- Little Catharine is quite lively & well , & improves in every respect . -- You will have seen in the Papers the death of Mrs- William Shipley , the Dean of S t - Asaph 's wife , they were remarkably attached to each other & happy together , & therefore it is a very severe stroke to him . She died of a low Fever , & has left him 8 Children . You need not return the verses I enclose . We all unite in affectionate Compliments to You & Mr Dickinson , & I remain Your Much Obliged Friend E. Iremonger
