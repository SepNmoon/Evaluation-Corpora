Audley Stt . Friday . n I set out on purpose to take Leave of Dear Mrs Dickenson , but -- arriv 'd at Her Door the Rain began to fall & the People to run wch . so represented to Me the Storm of last Night , at least renew 'd the Terror of it that I call 'd out Home Home tho my Coach door was open 'd to get Out & wait on You . Cowards there always were , & if it be not in Battle there is no Harm done . I was glad to see yr Precious Daur looking as if London had done Her no Harm . If before You leave this part of the World any thing shd bring You to Kew or Richmond I hope You will enquire for Rosedale & yr Obedient humble Servant F. Boscawen To Mrs Dickenson Half Moon Street Boulton Street
