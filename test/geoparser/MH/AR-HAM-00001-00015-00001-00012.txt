St James 's March the 25 th 1786 Why do you not write to me my dear Friend ? Why have you never answered my last letter ? are you not well ? I will not beleive that you are enough so to prevent you writing -- I should have said all this before , for I have constantly intended it , but I have been in a continual hurry , and very much tormented wth a cough -- I should be quite in despair at your silence had not I seen Mr Dickenson who aſsured me both of your health & of the multitude of your epistolary engagements , which I will know by experience what allowances to make for -- I aſsure you that except at breakfast , & at night when I return home & am not too much fatigued to attend to anything , I never have time to open a Book , the little time I can spare from visiting I give to musick , and to exercise , when the weather permits me to do so much for my Health -- as for Evenings the few that remain at my own disposal , my Friends seize upon , often when I had rather stay quietly at home . but how can I shew my gratitude for their attachment & friendships & my sense of it , but by complying with requests so flatteri n g & so warmly urged -- some indeed are affronted if I paſs 4 days without coming to them -- to those indeed I go with leſs pleasure tho ' their motive , can not but flatter me . inshort perfect liberty is the summum bonum & where there is the least restraint , the least obligation of doing the thing even that we like , the charm is fled -- you indeed my dear Friend are happy , if happineſs exists for us -- & may you long continue so ! may bleſsings be poured down upon you , with every circumstance that can enhance their value , or add to them a charm . I have been much better within these ten Days -- some very warm , delightful weather had almost cured my cough , it is now snowing violently and has done so for two Days , so I expect that tomorrows ancient musick will give me fresh cold -- poor dear Mrs Delany has been very indifferent herself , and exceſsively distreſsed about Mrs Port who has been dangerously ill in her house & is still ill , tho ' better -- Mrs D . is but very indifferent -- I am sure you will be vexed at this most cruel circumstance we have often agreed that at all times Mrs Port 's visit is rather a bad & hurryi n g thing for poor Mrs D . but to be ill , there , is too provoking , especially at a moment when I am sure she wanted no additional circumstance of distreſs to overcome her spirits & resolution -- My F . & c are at length arrived at Bruſsels -- I heard from my Brother from thence on Friday , who gives me a very comfortable account of them , tho ' without sayi n g a syllable -- on the subject of their return . I do not expect it till the end of May -- The sensation of being but 4 Days distance from them after having been at that of 19 -- is quite delight ful & prepares me in some degree for the joy of that moment when I shall find myself in their arms -- I was the other night at a Ball at Ly Gideon 's which is the only gay thing I have been guilty of since I wrote to you I danced a good deal , after the crowd went away & that it became cool & pleasant -- I beleive it did me good & I rather think with pleasure of a Ball next Thursday at the french Embaſsadors where I am to be , if a long Drawingroom in the morning does not quite fatigue me for the day I am to day going to dine & spend the Evening wh M rs Wilmot -- Mrs Bates is to be there at night & of cour se the entertainment will be delightful -- this is & will be preferable in my opinion to all other amusem ents there is nothing like musick , no , not even Mrs Siddons -- adieu my dear , I must conclude this uninteresti n g stupid scrawl , which has no merit but that of aſsuring you of my sincere & tender attachme nt I will not paſs another day without sending my letter which I was interrupted in three days ago , as you will perceive by the date -- this is Tuesday 28 th -- adieu , ever your affec : CMG . Remember me kindly to Mr D . & Ly . Wake -- you now owe me two letters -- died at Paris To Ld A Hamilton Courteen Hall Northamton I hear two , that I hear to that
