It will give my Lord & me very great pleasure to hear that your Situation at Dallington is perfectly to your mind & Mrs : Hamilton 's , whose health , as well as yours , we wish to hear a good Act : of , & hope your Daughter turns out to your wiſh , & I may say expectation , for she appeard to us extremely promising . I supose Mrs. Hamilton will take it in good part if she is told her Daughter is , as tall as herself , 't is a Complimt : I meet with every day , tho mine wants half a year of the age of thirteen : Charles is so Stout that he followed the Coach with four horses , on horseback to day to Turnham green & back again with out the least fatigue , he is quite well , & the Docr . thinks he will be fit to go to his Br . at Eton after Easter : I have a little Archd Hamilton to shew you , that you have never seen , I hope you will like him & not let him be grown up to the dreſs of a Man before you see him , he is just got to the age of speakg every thing intelligeably , two years & a half old , I believe it is more than three yrs since we have met , wch : may cause some alteration as to looks amongst us , but one article I am sure is the Same .
