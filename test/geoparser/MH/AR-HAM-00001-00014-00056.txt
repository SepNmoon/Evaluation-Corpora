Madam I am happy to hear you are so much better I shall not go to Church , & wish you would follow my Advice to day tho ' you was so perverse the other Day , & not come at all , for we can manage very well , & I think you had better Nurse yourself to as you go to morrow to Windsor Adieu Sincly Yr- MCG -- I grieve for your Ball --
