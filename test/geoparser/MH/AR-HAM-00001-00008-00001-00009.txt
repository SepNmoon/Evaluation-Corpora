Curzon Street Mar . 31 . 1791 Dear Sir I consider your very obliging letter , with which I have been favored , as a proof of your friendship & regard , & for which I desire to return my particular acknowledgements . I own , I am led to prefer the Opinion & practice of those Gentlemen , who have made the structure of the Human body , & the Nature of medicines their constant & regular study , to those who have not had such advantages . But as Mr. John Hunter told me last Winter , my Complaint lay so deep , that He did not apprehend any external application would reach it , but that I must trust to time & a good Constitution , I have not lately much troubled the profeſsion . I have certainly a freer use of the leg , but the amendment is very slow , & I must content Myself with having had a full share of activity & motion . If I had not been advised against the Use of Warm bathing , I should have been inclined to have tried Buxton , & certainly it would have been a strong inducement , to have had an Opportunity of paying our respects to Mrs. Dickenson & yrself . We are Happy to receive so good an account of Her , & the little Louisa . Mrs. Iremonger 's Complaint in her Eyes is much leſs than it was , when We first came to town , but her Health is not so perfect , as her friends wish it . My Daughter desires me to say , that she did not receive the letter from Mrs. Dickenson , but intends to write to Her very soon . Tho ' I beleive you to be a prudent Man , yet I should have been surprized indeed , if you had been the only man , that had escaped the inconveniencies that all the World fall into , when they begin to build , of exceeding their original intentions . I hope you will approve of yr . alterations , when they are finished , & that you both will have health to injoy them . Though We approve of Mr. Pitt 's measures in general , & wish Him to continue Minister , yet some of his best friends object to the frequent alarms of War ; & still more , if they proceed farther ; they think , that , during the unsettled state of france , from which Country our cheif danger lies , We ought to attend to the leſsening our immense debt , especially as now there so fair a prospect of doing it ; the new Sinking fund redeeming every year £1,700,000 of the 3 p er ct . ; they farther think , that Ruſsia would be our most Uſeful ally , & that it little imports England , to whom Constantinople should belong . as you live so much in the Country , I suppose you occupy some land . Where the Quantity is in proportion to the Establishment & the Consumption , I imagine , there can not be much loſs , & that it will afford some amusement . Mrs . I . , my Daughter & Catherine ( who grows tall & is delicate ) join with me in presenting our best Wishes , & I am Dr . Sr . yr . faithful & obliged Servt . Joshua Iremonger
