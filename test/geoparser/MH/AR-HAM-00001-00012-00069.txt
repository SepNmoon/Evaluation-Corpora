My Dear Miſs Hamilton I have just receiv 'd a very moving Letter from Mr Planta informing me of his Sister s Death , & expreſsing in the most grateful terms his Sense of her Majesty s Gracious Goodness to her . He adds , As I suppose it will be Improper to leave the Corpse in the Palace any longer than is absolutely neceſsary I beg your Laſps . directions when it should be removed . I wish you would desire Mrs Hagerdorn to shew this to her Majesty tonight , that I may receive her Orders concerning the Answer I should make ; as her Majesty probably goes to Kew tomorrow Morning , it might be late in the day before I could have the honor of speaking to her . I am Ever most Sincerely Yrs . CFinch Monday Night . ¼ past Ten We have recd . a sad Account of Mr Dawson .
