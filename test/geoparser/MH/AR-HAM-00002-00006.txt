I left her soon after Breakfast came to my room -- dreſs 'd for y e . day as we were ( Mrs- D : & me ) to go to Admiral Forbes 's at Chalfont -- but ye .

Son in Law one of the most horrid wretches I ever heard of -- his conduct towards his beautiful amiable wife being brutal , beyond imagination brutal -- this wretch had an intrigue with his Brother s wife -- Kill 'd his own -- & ruin 'd a lady -- ye . particulars are too long for to note down at present . About 1 o'Clock ye .

Dſs . gain 'd her point however Mrs Delany went to her Room to take her Siesta -- ye . Dſs . & I remaind together till she return 'd The Dſs . was so obliging to read me out of some miscelaneous Manuscripts -- -- chiefly remarks on Mrs D . s History written by ye . present Barnet s grandfather -- he gave them to ye . Dſs . to transcribe from ye . original -- these remarks proved that Lord Dartmouth was influenced too often by a party spirit -- among other things she read me were two anecdotes relating to Barnet -- ye . Czar paid him a visit -- unfortunately a favorite Monkey of Charles ye . 2d . s was in ye . room who took in it his head to be vastly affronted because ye . Czar look 'd at him , and he endeavour 'd to revenge y e . affront , by grinning & jumping upon him : -- so the whole visit conversation that paſs 'd was in making apologies to ye . King & c . his Majesty had a desire to see The Czar at ye . House of Lords & hear ye . Speeches -- but did not chuse to be seen -- he therefore went upon ye . leads of ye . House & look 'd through ye . Windows -- he soon caught the eyes of the King & Lords , & they not being able to resist laughing at the ridiculous figure he made , -- he soon retired . -- At 7 tea , during tea I contrived to finish a letter to Dear ye King & one to my Uncle Anna Maria After tea I read Evelina which I finishd at ten oClock -- ye .

Mrs. Delany -- wch . contain 'd more comfortable accounts of little Anna Maria & one from Fanny . soon after 10 left Miſs Gunning came to me at 11 & desird me to accompany her to her room -- she had received letters wch . alas ! her eyes would were not in a state to read -- tho ' I felt much honor 'd by the confidence she placed in me my heart ach 'd to think she no longer was obliged to make use of mine I read her letters -- in one wch . was from her eldest Nephew Mrs. Delany , who lately spent a week here , there was these lines -- “ my best reſpects “ to Mr. Dews -- I hope she is still “ at Bullstrode , her sprightlineſs “ will chase away those any “ lowness of spirits you may have “ wherever she is , sorrow can surely make no long abode . ” I was pleased with his remembrance of me for he is an excellent worthy man . I also read the news papers to her , & then she insisted upon my going to take a Walk , I obey 'd -- for is it poſsibly to refuse obeying her dictates ? the weather was remarkably fine -- no fog -- the sun shone bright . & ye . wind was I believe South -- I went to y e . Grotto wch . was made by Miſs H -- I sat in it for some time & enjoy 'd the calm serenity of the scene for some time around me . here I thought of all those whom I loved , of every one whose friendship I was so happy to enjoy -- when I return 'd I fed the Peacocks & Guinea fowls who follow 'd me -- every Bird & animal in this place of wch . there are a great variety are tame & sociable .
