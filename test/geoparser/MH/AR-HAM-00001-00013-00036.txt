De ar A Maria goes with me , Mrs. Devaynes gave m e the tickets , it is Mr. Smith s benefit . On Wednesday we go to Sunning hill for a few days . As you like anecdotes I will tell you one of two gen tlemen of the City , the one is a Mr. Skinner , the othe r a Mr. Dunford , who is a very busy meddling man , & is always finding fault with his neighbour -- The late Lord Mayor ; Mr Clarke ( who is a very worthy man ) as soon as his Mayoralty was out , was call 'd to acco unt by Mr .. Dunford who charged him with not allowing the prisoners in Newgate what was their due , & he brought as a proof a number of Butchers & Bakers , who by their account , so far from Mr .. Clarke defrauding them , that he gave them more than is usual & chiefly at his own expence ; the court which amounted to about 180 citizens , wish 'd to rebuke Mr. Dunford very severely , Mr. Skinner got up and said Gentlemen , give me leave to tell you what rebuke I would wish you to paſs upon Mr. D ...... When I was a boy of thirteen my Mother was left a widow , she put me an apprentice in Newgate , but before I went , she said Tom , their are three things which I wish you always to bear in your mind , the first is to remember that whatsoever money paſses through your hands is sacred & let yr . diſstreſses be what they will must never be touch 'd by you , secondly speak not ill nor do no mischief to thy neighbour , but if you can speak well of him or can help him do it , & thirdly try to make yourself as happy as people in general try to make themselves Miserable , & you will be a very happy man , it Affected Mr. Dunford so much that he burst into tears , the court were so much pleased with it , that he really went an without being further rebuked . Mrs. L .. desires her Affectionate compts . to you & my Brother . & I remain your ever obliged & affectionate M : G——r Let me have an answer about Sally as I feel quite interested for her . -- Mrs .. Dickenson at Sir W : Wake s Courteen Hall Northampton
