Deal Castle . July 24 th . 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton , I beg you will inform their Majesties that Prince Alfred has been out on Horseback Yesterday & to day , that he seem 'd very well pleas 'd even the first time , but to day was eager to go , & does not seem at all fatigued with it so I hope it will be of Service to him . he slept very tollerably last Night , & has eat his Dinner to day with a good Appetite ; his Cough has been leſs troublesome , & he is cooler , so that I hope I may call this a better Account than I have been able to ſend lately . His Eye is as it was when Hawkins saw him.I am much obliged to you for your last Letter , to which I would make a longer Answer if I had any thing worth telling you , but that not being the Case , I am sure you will not be sorry that I detain you no longer than to aſsure you that I am ever Moſt faithfully & Sincerely Yours CFinch My Duty & Compliments I trust to your Care . Mrs Feilding desires to be remember 'd to you . This is my last Frank .
