Kew Sepr : . 16 . 1782 My dear Miſs Hamilton Though I had not received your commands to write , my own inclination would have urged me to have troubled you with a few lines to have begged your acceptance of my best thanks for your hospitable reception of me at Windsor . If it could be supposed poſsible that any circumstance could add to the happineſs of living under the same roof with Royalty , & at the invitation of Royalty , I would say that my felicity had been considerably augmented by the kind attention of my hosteſs to whose particular care our Royal Mistreſs had consigned me . -- But to speak seriously , I feel myself most deeply impreſsed with a sense of her Majesty s most gracious & condescending goodneſs to me , which nothing I have done , or ever shall be able to do , can merit . -- Your Philosophical Preparation from Chichester reached Kew in perfect preservation & was presented to the person you designed it for , in the manner you prescribed . It was received with a countenance strongly expreſsive of curiosity with a mixture of surprize , but which upon a discovery of the contents of the Phial , was , at first , softened into a smile , & at last convulsed with a fit of Laughter . The person whom you have heard me speak of with so much warmth was present at the opening of the Pacquet , & was much entertained at with the many changes our friend s Countenance underwent . And now , my good Madam do not laugh while I relate to you the vexation I experienced after I took my leave of you on Wednesday . My poor silly Servant , whose head I verily beleive was turned , had over & above the two Guineas I had given him at Kew to pay his own expences , & those of my horses , run me up a bill of between two and three pounds more . I suppose my Gentleman foreseeing that he should be discharged , had determined to live well , & enjoy himself while he could . To console himself after his beating I found he had a duck roasted for his dinner , with strong Coffee as soon as his Cloath was removed . I had some doubts at first , whether I should not dismiſs him upon the spot , & leave him & the Master of the Inn Mr. Clode to settle their accounts together ; -- but upon a little reflection I judged it to be better to take him with me to Kew where upon my arrival I instantly discharged him . I found ten Shillings charged for the article of his Lodging : I mention this , because you told me that i s t was the expreſs order of a certain person that my Servant s lodgings should be paid . I beg your pardon for troubling you so long upon so shabby a subject , but as you had been acquainted with the former part of my distre ſs I co uld not prevail upon myself not to relate to you sequ el I shall say nothing about our frien d has told me , that he intended to make all due acknowledgements to you for your truly valuable present , & kind remembrance of him . Permit me to subscribe myself My dear Madam Your much obliged most obedient most devoted humble Servant J. Fisher Miſs Hamilton at the Queens Lodge Windsor
