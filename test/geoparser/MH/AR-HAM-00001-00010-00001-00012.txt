Report of Mrs Hamilton s fall , 1777 or 8 . My dearest Miranda I am with your Mamma , she sends her Love to you , & would have seen you to-day , but has unfortunately had a fall from her chair , & although she is not much disordered by it , she can not conveniently stir out . I have been disappointed of the pleasure of drinking tea with you through a fatal mistake which Debounaire will explain to you , & which put me for a few minutes quite out of humour . Lady Dartrey has been here this morning she has a deafneſs , which is come on suddenly , & which prevented her being at Court this morning . she was with Mr : Maul , I hope he will relieve her , she has inquired much after you , & having heard of your Illneſs has been uneasy on your account , she has written to you two or three times by the penny post , but has not received any answer . Mrs. Hamilton is infinitely obliged to their Royal Highneſses , for the honour of the very pretty Billet ; the intelligence , the Princeſs Royal , has been so good as to send her of her daughter is very interesting , & she can not forgive you for concealing it , although she is not very intimately acquainted with Monsieur le Compte , yet as her Royal Highneſs has permitted you to accept of his hand she is aſsured that , he is worthy of your choice , & she congratulates you , she desires you will present her Duty , to their Royal Highneſses , & aſsure them , that she should have been at Kew to have seen you , had not the fall she has had prevented her . Adieu ma chere Miranda Je vous aime & Je vous estime toujours infiniment , & plus que Je ne vous puiſse le dire . Nous irons demain à la Campagne où Je penserai de vous . James Street . Thursday Evening . Let me explain the accident Mrs. Hamilton has met with , it was no more than this , her chair having slipped backwarder than she imagined , she fell , but has only hurt her leg in the slightest manner . Mr. Glover has written to you this morning & sent it by penny post -- Mrs. Hamilton fears that you will not receive it -- if Mr : Glover was to give you the whole history of his disappointments in coming to see you , it would fill up a folio Catherine has locked up her pretty snuff box , you see what an influence a hint from your Ladyship has .
