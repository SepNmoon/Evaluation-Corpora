Barley Wood Feb 14 My dear Friends ! I should have written a line as soon as I saw a very interesting and important event in the public papers , had not the severe preſsure of bodily suffering , with the addition of much depreſsion of Spirits from the recent loſs , immediately one upon another of three friends some of the brightest and best Men of the age nearly disqualified me . My grief for departed friends however , will I trust , never leſsen the affectionate interest I take in those which remain . Accept then tho late , my very cordial congratulations on the marriage of your dear and very amiable daughter . May it please God to bleſs her , and the Man of her choice ( who I trust would not have been so had he not been worthy of her ) with as much happineſs as this world can give to those who are looking forward to a better ; and which indeed is the best way to promote happineſs here . The new Scene they are entering upon , as it will enlarge their duties , and their usefulneſs , so I trust it will proportionally increase their felicity . When I rejoyce with my young friends on their marriage I am generally more inclined to condole with the parents than to congratulate them , because in the most desirable union the personal loſs of a dear daughter , whose society has long been their comfort , is a great drawback on their share of the happineſs , but if I am not mistaken that is not to be the case here . Pray tell me all about it , for notwithstanding our long separation , my attachment to so old and kind a friend still continues unabated . The three friends to whom I alluded , and who were called away within 3 weeks were Mrs Hannah More , Mr. H. Thornton the great Orientalist and Dr. Buchanan . The former has left Nine children and a widow whose behaviour is most angelic . Mr. John Bowdler the most accomplished character I knew , was to have been married next Month to a sweet friend of mine , the daughter of Bowdler whose admir works you must have read . His piety as exemplary , as his talents were elevated . Do you see Mr. Gisborne sometimes ? I wish I could hear about her , sometimes but I know it must be troublesome to her to write . I now and then ( which is more than I deserve ) get a delightful letter from our agreeable friend Mrs. Garrick , whom I saw once last Year for half an hour , and who is just the same in mind and person as he was fo u rty years ago . How small are the remnants of that superior Society in which we used to live ! My own health is very bad . The warnings of age and sickneſs will not I hope be thrown away upon me . My best love to the bride , and pray tell me the style and title of the caro Sposo . Adieu my dear Sir Wm . Pepys believe me both of you your very faithful and affectionate Mrs. Dickenson H.
