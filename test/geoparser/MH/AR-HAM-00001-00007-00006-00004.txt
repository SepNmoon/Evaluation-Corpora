Mr. Fisher presents his Compliments to Miſs Hamilton , -- is very sorry he could not have the pleasure of seeing her this morning . He wished to offer her a petition in behalf of his Brother , which as a Patroneſs of the Arts Mr. F . hopes Miſs H . will have no objection to grant . The Matter is this : Mr. G. Fisher has nearly finished a Landscape in Oyl , which he wants to ornament with some Cattle ; & he recollects seeing among Miſs H . s pictures , a Landscape where there are some Cattle which will suit his purpose : He has entreated of me his Brother to beg Miſs H . will indulge him with the use of that Picture for a couple of days . Any morning that Miſs H . is most at leisure , Mr. F . will beg leave to shew her some Drawings which his Brother has finished in the course of the last Summer S t . Jamess . Wed : morn : 19 th .
