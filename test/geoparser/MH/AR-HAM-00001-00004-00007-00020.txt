To Mr. Charles Hamilton . fr om Mr Fredk Dear Brother , I arrived here a few days ago , having in the midst of storms met with a safe though a rough paſsage to Holy Head ; we ran it in light hours from Skerries , the inundations that are every where can hardly be conceiv 'd ; however I am now safe in port , & must be satisfied to pospone my projects to a more favourable opportunity , as a combination of unforeseen croſs circumstances seem to conspire against my carrying them into execution at present : upon the whole my expedition was far from being an unprofitable one , as I have arranged my affairs so as to go on for some time at least , without requiring my presence . I have concluded amicably with Mr. Buttle & discharged his Bill of Costs , which for doing leſs than nothing was still by no means a small one . I left Mr. Fetherston in Dublin concluding a Purchase with Ld Kingsland ; I cou 'd make no fixt agreement with him till I have had an opportunity of knowing what trouble he will have upon my account for which he is well aſsured that he will be properly considered . I have left directions with Mr. Welldone to send the Picture by the first opportunity , of which he is to give me notice , as your collection increases , I conclude ; you will soon be under the neceſsity of looking out for larger apartments . I have receiv 'd much greater civilities from many people here than I had reason to expect which will make my residence here much more agreeable than it has hitherto been I beg to be rememberd to Mrs. Hamilton & my Niece I am Dear Brother Yours most affectionately Frederick Hamilton York Feby . 17 . th 1764 . Mr F Hamilton to his Brother
