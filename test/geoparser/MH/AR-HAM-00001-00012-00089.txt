My drst- Miſs Hamilton , What can I say for your kind & genteel thought about ye Cap -- You have Sent me ye prettiest in ye World -- I aſsure you I was quite Shock 'd at first -- & I am jealous about it -- But I soon reflect 'd that any one who had ye Idea -- would wish their Present Accepted -- I therefore receive it with Pleasure & return you many thanks for it -- & wish I may ever ( to do credit to ye Cap ) apply this pretty imitation to as good Effect as ye Original I was so much Struck with this & t is so very late that I will only add that I am yr Obliged & sincere humble Sert H . Miſs Hamilton
