Park Street 110 -- Londn- April 5 th . 1787 my Dear Honble Wilhelmina Murray to shew , You , how much I aprove Your obliging intention of never remaining silent so long again , have taken up the pen to sett the example and thank You for Your kind letter which gave me double pleasure , by aſsureing me of Your Health and that of the charming Mrs Dickenson , who I already see , poſseſsed of a thousand Jolies petites manieres to shew her own good humor , and expreſsive of the good sense & c & c that she will shew , when a little more time , enables her to speak . -- in the meantime , Mama will already understand her meaning in her Eyes : and ( if report says true ) in some months hence will present her with a companion & rival , no bad thing to prevent the danger of being spoilt . having said so much of Chere ye Princeſs tis time to say we are sorry to find Louisa has not found the benefit expected from Bath . but have heard it often remarked that the virtues of those waters are found more strongly after they have been left off . sincerely hope Mr. Dickenson will experience the truth -- Mr. Dickinson looks very thin and complains of nerves and headachs ; Lady Stormont came to her for a month and unluckily was taken ill of the chicken pox , which she gave the children : they are all got well again so I think it a lucky thing over for them ; but it has disapointed Miſs Cathcart very much who was in the time to have had masters & seen a little of the World -- but all this You have from better Authority -- so shall say no more of that part of Yr . Familly -- Miſs C . enquired kindly after You a few evenings ago at Lady Caroline Peachy s , she did the same and beged her compts -- Mrs. Leland does not seem to have recover 'd her loſs . Ly . Caroline is as You heard in a very complaining way , her age is much against expecting much amendment : and , the pleasure she enjoys , with partaking of a good dinner ( when invited to one ) is often atended with bad consequences -- Lady Wallingford is wonderfully well , her Doctor is now the patient , and all the town is enquiring after Mrs. Leland who it is said has a 21 days fever & has had 3 relapses so thought in danger having told You enough about sick people will change the subject but not till I have said Doctor Warren has had the gout in his foot to the great joy of the Gentlemen about Him who triumph in the idea that He must now acknowledge that cruel disorder will attack sober people as well as those that sit over the bottle . as he always insisted , that the gout was acquired by sitting too much round the brown table -- at H. Majesty 's last thursday , the Dutcheſs of Cumberland took her leave of the Faro table as usual at a stated hour , being too great an invalid to keep the fashonable late hours -- on quiting the table she left five guineas , saying if any body would play with that for her she shd . be obliged but she would lose no more a friend undertook it -- but she was no sooner gone than Lady Ferrars sat down & said he would play for her . about 3 in the morning he had won 100 Guineas delighted with his luck he left the table saying he must carry it imediatly to the Prince of W—— . it was in vain told him she would be abed and all the Familly asleep . he was determined and getting into the coach with Lady Ferrars drove to Lady Eliza : Lutterrell after repeatedly knocking frighted Servant out of window begged to know where the fire was , he answer 'd that they must open the door instantly as Ly . F—— must speak to Ly . E . the door was opened the whole familly frightened out of their sences the Prince & Ly . went up stairs , H . R . H . had the grace to stop at the bedchamber door while she went in saying Ly . F—— sends You a Shower of Gold and flinging the money on the table went home leaving the whole house in an uproar & the neighbours alarmed -- the Prince of Wales gave a great Ball the Prince was there so drunk he could not stand making violent love to Lady Hopetoun & swearing she was still handsomer than all the D——d young things that thought so much of them selves & were so admired -- it seems the fashon to marry without wanting house or home -- the Duchess of Argyll is trying it ; Mrs. Fox ( Miſs Clayton ) is just Married to Miſs Charlotte St. John with having only 800 a yr . to spend on which they have got a handsome coach & Phaeton & gone to Brighton , Mr. Yates is next week to try the same fashon with Miſs Caroline Walpole -- they have no house but are to live among their Friends it is certainly a new scheme & seems an uncomfortable one my Sister joyns with Mr. Neish & self in best wishes to yourself & Capt : Murray & remain Yrs . Affectly .
