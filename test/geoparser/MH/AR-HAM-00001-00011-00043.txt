Pheasant Grove Tuesday Night My Dear Mrs : Dickenson Your Animation & midnight Livelineſs , have affected me so much , that tho ' Lady W . & Marianne are gone to Bed tired , I , even drowsey as I usually am , should much prefer a chearful Chatting Hour , to the still & composed Occupation of putting on my Night Cap , & going to Rest . I am resolved to begin a Letter to you to tell you this mighty change , to tell you how much we have miſsed , & how much we have thought of you at Courteen-hall -- we drank your Health , & all agreed you were tired down , by having walked about with Sir William . I hope you had a good Journey , & that Mr : D 's Leg is better & Louisa , good dear little Louisa quite well . We spent this Morning very pleasantly , first visiting Mrs : Weddel , & then lounging ( I hope you know the meaning of that Word , ) about Lord Campden s Grounds : it was a fine Day , & we were very comfortable & agreable . Tomorrow I leave this pretty Place , & my dr & kind Friend ; I expect my Husband on Thursday , so I go to see that all is in order for his Reception . I must now say Adieu , my dr : Mrs : D . Kind Remembrances to Mr : D . Kiſs d r : Louisa & tell yr : self that I am Yrs : Affly PC you are always so good as to appear interested about Mrs. M : Therefore you will be glad to know I have heard from her -- all our Letters are very comfortable and satisfactory . Remember me most Affectionately to Mr. Dickenson & kiſs the dear & amiable Louisa for me , & believe me most Affectionately yours Marianne -- Thursday morning . We wished you to find our letter my dear friend upon your arrival at Birch Hall for which I fear it will now be too late , having been prevented writing until this morning . a few lines from Dr Richard this morning gives us the pleasure of knowing you arrived safe & in good time on Monday at C . Hall . from what he says I doubt if the weather on Tuesday was as fine as with us ; here it was lovely . Poor Wm has not been so fortunate in getting his Hay in , as I have . this Post has brought me a letter from Dr Mrs. Carter . She complains that her Elementary Head , has sadly felt the effects of this damp & rainy Novem ber Summer . She intends writing to you soon . I need not tell you how much pleasure I have had in your society at P. Grove , nor with what satisfaction I shall look forward to a renewal of it next Spring . I am so deep in Visiting & Letter Debts , that I can not now indulge myself in scribbling so much as I wish to do . I shall wait with impatience to hear from you , how your good Husband s ancle does ; how you liked your Visit to poor Dr . William ; how you found your friends at Birch Hall
