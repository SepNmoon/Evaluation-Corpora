I wrote yesterday sev'Night , and no answer have I yet received , or the smallest intimation of your existence -- Before this time I expected to have had the pleasure & satisfaction of embracing you -- but I am now informed that Sir Wm Wake has bought a House in Eſsex and has send for his Cows sheep & c from Courteen hall to stock the grounds on this new purchase -- is it there they mean to spend the summer ? -- and are you to remain with them -- ? this is an admirable sheme , and will suit me amazingly -- I should be glad tho ' , if you are alive , to hear it from yourself -- and to be told something of your intentions -- I send you the pattern of a Border , desiring you buy me 17 Yds of it at Hodgkins immediatly , pray do this -- I gave you another commiſsion -- but if you do not come , you can not execute it -- I am almost as ill as ever -- my pain returned on Saturday -- God 's will be done -- I am born to suffer . what a dreadful Storm of Thunder we had on Wednesdy I was thoroughly terrified -- it burst in our shrubbery think how we must have been Shook -- it was indeed tremendous -- my dear Brother has left us for sometime -- Mrs Walsingham , who has been here this week , took him h yesterday , to Weston -- we feel quite melancholy & want you of all things -- on Saturday we drove to Sir Wm . s and availed ourselves of of the permiſsion Mr Bridgeman was so good as to give us , in paſsing thro ' his grounds I inquired , when he was expected down , but they new nothing of his coming -- The weather is heavenly -- the clouds have every day threatened an alteration in it , & the Barometer aſsures us of a long continuance of rain , but in the meantime it is fine and , I we enjoy ourselves -- I am going this Evening to Lady Harriett Vernon s -- I have so Many visits hanging over me , that I feel quite oppreſsed with them -- adieu -- Sir Wm Wake & I go on very well together in a negative way -- write to me immediatly & be aſsured that I am toujours de même .
