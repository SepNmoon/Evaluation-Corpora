My Dear Miſs Hamilton We are all much obliged by your kind Enquiry , but it is a house full of Invalids & poor Mr Feilding I fear very seriously so ; he has had but an indifferent Night as I hear . My Cold is very troublesome & I am very unwell with it , & our little Sophie I found in a high Fever , She has had a tollerable Night & I hope is better to day but I have not yet Seen her . All these Circumstances make me wish to postpone a little the pleasure of Seeing you here , added to the taking leave of Lady Juliana Penn who has promis 'd to reserve a part of this Evening to come to me as She sets out for Paris tomorrow Morning . I hope you are well & remain ever my dear Miſs Hamilton Most Sincerely Yrs . CFinch Sunday Morng . Miſs Hamilton
