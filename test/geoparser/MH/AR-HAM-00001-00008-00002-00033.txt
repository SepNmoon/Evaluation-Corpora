Mr Bloſset is extremely sorry he has caused Miſs Dickenson any uneasineſs by his past conduct . His object was to clear his own mind from impreſsions which he is now convinc 'd were entirely false -- Being now satisfied that he has been under a delusion , he aſsures her that in future he shall give her no further trouble , and he wishes her every kind of happineſs -- He shall have great pleasure in renewing at some future time his acquaintance with her and her family .
