My dear Cousin , I wrote you word in my last , of the various circumstances that prevented my accepting your kind invitation to Leighton House . Immediately afterwards , I was still more effectually prevented from thinking of it ; as I was attacked by a second very severe fit of illneſs . I am , however , now recovering , but much reduced , and very weak . My Father ( with whom I told you I was in consultation ) had advised me to lose no time in securing myself a little establishment , as every thing of that sort would will become scarcer and consequently dearer , with the advance of the Season . I have , accordingly , set several friends to look out ; but my illness has retarded my proceedings , by impeding my seeking for myself . I am in hopes of soon getting suited ; and am the more patient , as I could not , at present , with prudence , remove ; particularly in this severe weather . I have heard from Mr : Holman since I wrote to you -- there is not the slightest appearance of any favourable change in that quarter , I am sorry to say ; but , as to pecuniary busineſs , if he punctually adhere to what he promises , I may , with the aſsistance my dear Father will afford me , be enabled to live pretty comfortably , upon the very moderate scale I shall adopt . -- When I am once settled , I must endeavour to tranquillize and occupy my mind , as I owe all my illneſs to agitation and grieving . I believe there never were such letters of egotism as I send you ; but I know you and your kind family wish to hear about me . My Father wrote me word of Mr : Dickenson 's obliging letter of invitation ; but he can not be induced to go from home . I hope you , Mr : Dickenson , and my Cousin Louisa , have escaped the Colds that have been so generally consequent to this weather . Pray , present them my kindest regards , and accept them yourself . I must now conclude , as writing is rather an effort to me , at present . Believe me , my dear Cousin your truly obliged & affectionat e Jane Holman 35 Aldgate High St : London . Dec : 8 th : 1807 . Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire Single
