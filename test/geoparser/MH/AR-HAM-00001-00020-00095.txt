Cork , 8 Dec Janry- 1786 . My Dear Sister , As you are now no longer a Miſs about S t . James 's , but have risen into the far more respectable situation of a Country Housewife , I presume you are now employed superintending & aſsisting Lady Wake 's housekeeper in the fabrication of Mince Pyes , & of course expect that my letter should begin by Wishing you the Compliments of the Season . To be serious , I hope Lady Wake is resigned to her situation . Her loſs is ( I beleive ) irreparable ) , but Sir Wm- s bad health must have long given her reason to fear what you write me word has happened . She is a Young Woman , her family , I suppose not large , as I never heard you talk of any child but the present Sir William . Mr. Glover 's death I was ignorant of , till I received your letter . Whatever Airs I may have given myself relative to his writings , be aſsured I ever respected him , from knowing his disinterested Attachment to You . I myself have lately experienced Alarms , which thank God are now all over . My vexatious Legacy had obliged me to go to Dublin . I left my little Mary in the small Pox from which she has been for some time perfectly well . On my leaving Cork , a spotted Fever was very prevalent there . I had not been many days in Dublin when I received a Letter from Maria telling me that she was confined to her bed with a Scarlet Fever . You may beleive I immediately returned home , where I found her out of danger from that disorder but in a few days she was seized with a complaint in her bowells attended with very alarming circumstances , which for two days made me apprehend the most fatal consequences -- But that Providence , who gave me my Maria was equally beneficent in preserving her to Me . I trust I shall ever remain thankfull for the Gift . I hope your swindling business no longer exists . I can not conceive how they came to single You out , for playing their Pranks on . You had neighbours in that Square at S t . James 's much more likely to have got into such a Scrape ! As soon as I received your Letter , I wrote to Mrs- Hunter . I fear she may not have been able to shew that attention to Mr. Wm . Dickenson that I am confident she would have wished to do . She has unfortunately inherited the Gout from my Father , & has lately had a violent attack of it in her Stomack . This is the second time of its visiting her . At any time of Life that disorder must be alarming & in her situation her family have every thing to fear . My Letter absolutely puts me in mind of the Bills of Mortality . I could burn it , only that I write to Yo u just as I feel -- The newspaper accounts were not perfectly exact , relative to The Dutcheſs of Rutland & Maria . It is true that She went out an airing & dined with her Grace in private two or three times , but she had not sufficiently recovered the birth of her Daughter to be able to exhibit herself in public . The Dutcheſs had no companion with her , consequently was reduced to the neceſsity of feeling herself obliged to Maria for being with her at all . She is a silly Woman , not comfortable in her matrimonial connection and of course more an object of Pity , than Envy . I believe her to be naturally good humoured , but fond of universal Admiration . The Duke attached to his Bottle makes her Grace a secondary object of his esteem . Such a System will not do . Maria unites with me in every kind and affectionate wish to Yourself and Mr. Dickenson , & we hope some time or other to aſsure you personally that we esteem you both . The lives of Soldiers are uncertain . We ( like true philosophers ) make the best of whatever situation my Duty throws Us into . I remain ever , My Dear Sister , Your faithfull friend & affectionate Brother , Napier . Mrs. Dickenson IRELAND CORK by Courteen Hall
