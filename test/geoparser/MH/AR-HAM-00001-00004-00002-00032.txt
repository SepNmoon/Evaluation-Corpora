My dear Sir , I have now before me your very interesting & affectionate letter of the 25 th . of Novr . last unanswerd ! A shameful return for your unwearied & effectual services at the period of my unspeakable distreſs ; I need not inform you that I am lost to all manly energies , it is in deed too evident that the imbecillity of old age has the almost absolute dominion over me & writing is now become a very painful employment ; be aſsured therefore my dear Sir , without repetitions that the services for which I am indebted to you & Mrs. Dickenson were most judicious & consolatory in the highest degree . The event of your late loſs is somewhat different , but still the death of a most worthy Parent must always be an object of very sincere regret . Lady Aldborough my only remaining Child & the subject of my most solicitous concern has been at Bath for near this month past , she has constant resort to medical aſsistance , her constitution being much impaired & subject to most alarming attacks ; her complaint has been thought by some of the most eminent of the faculty in London to be seated in the liver , but the apprehension has of late much subsided , still it is much to be wished that her disorder which gives gives her great uneasineſs were more clearly ascertain 'd ; being arrived at a crititical period in life , it may happen that a sudden fortunate change may take place ; in the mean time her friends by whom she is much beloved ; live in constant anxiety on her anxiety account . I shou 'd esteem it a want of due confidence not to inform you , that my relation the late Duke of Queensberry , has left me a legacy of £10,000 , which was not altogether a surprize , as he once aſsured me that he wou 'd remember me ; With my best regard to Mrs. Dickenson & your dear Daugher , I remain My dear Sir your faithful & affectionate humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St Bath January 15 th . 1811 . 15 Jany 1811 Mr. Hamilton Telling of his Legacy from Ld . Queensberry John Dickenson Esqr . 49 . Welbeck Street Cavendish Square London
