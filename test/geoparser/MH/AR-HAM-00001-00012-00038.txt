Deal Castle : May 17 th . 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton What will you say at the Sight of your Frank so soon return 'd ? The Truth is , when I feel grateful I can not be Silent , therefore snatch 'd up my Pen the Moment I ha d ve recd your Letter , at the risk of tormenting you with a very stupid one , that I m ight ay indulge my self in telling you , how much I feel your kindneſs in writing so immediately , & , how much pleasure I expect from the Continuance of your Interesting Journal . From hence I must acknowledge I have nothing to tell , Our Sea-Scenes were as beautiful at Eastbourne , & our Landscapes much more so , but yet I find much to enjoy , & am so well circumstanced to join in any Composition you will produce in praise of Liberty that I can not enough lament my want of Talents to bear a Share in it . Think my dear Miſs H . what it is , to be able to say to myself when I rise at 7 in the Morning ( which I do here wth . alacrity , because I do it by Choice ) that I am in the full & absolute Poſseſsion of my whole day , & when at Eleven that I retire to my Room , tis more for neceſsary Refreshment than Rest , having undergone no fatigue either of Body or Mind ; but I shd . be ungrateful to mark out only these negative Advantages , for I have many delightful , & I hope useful Occupations , in the Attention I am able to pay to my dear little Grand Children , where I find the Soil so good , & so well prepared to receive every Instruction I am capable of giving , that I may expect my Harvest without labour . I am not of a turn ever to dwell upon what is unpleasant in my Destination , & especially where real Comforts so much pre pondera te , I think it would be wrong to do so ; however I am not insensible that this banishment deprives me of many Enjoyments at present , & most especially of the high one , I had so long look 'd to , of witnessing & partaking of the Joy of all my friends united , on the return of my Son , I may say to Life , as well as to his Country . however I hope for the happineſs of seeing him en paſsant , for that of dear Mrs Carter s being soon within my reach , & Mrs Feilding with her other little Girl coming in about a Month to reside amongst us . I am sure you will say I have reason to be contented with my Lot , & I thankfully acknowledge it . In your Journal pray do not forget particulars about yourself , for indeed my dear nobody can interest themselves more Sincerely about you than I do , or attend you more constantly in all your Peregrinations to & from Windſor , as well as in & about it , for I think you can hardly go up or down Stairs without my being able to trace you to a Moment . In some future Letter , I shall inform you of my regulations of my time , but I do not promise you the Uniformity you are accustom 'd to , thō my Materials ought not to furnish me from their Number , with half the Variety yours should , & now Adieu Ever Yrs .
