1 Sunday Evening 7 th March 1773 Your very kind Letter , my dear Miſs Hamilton , will occasion you more trouble than you were aware on . -- You will have to go thro ' a very long Letter , which I now propoſe to write to you ; but as your complaints are not in your Eyes , I hope the fatigue will not be too much for you . -- I am apt to pay too little Regard to the Complaints of young people as being but temporary ; but I ſincerely wiſh your 's may be of the ſhortest duration . -- I have mended my Pen , to go on with ; which ſerves like a Hem , or a Cough , or the blowing the Nose , by way of a pause , in Converſation . -- It gives one time to think , & put one 's Words in order . -- This is intended by to be a vindication of my Conduct , & I do n't know how to begin ; -- that looks as if I was about to plead in a very bad Cause . -- I confeſs it . -- I do n't know how to vindicate myſelf , without making a very long Story . -- I muſt begin with the Date of my marriage ; -- which appear 'd to be the commencement of my happineſs , but which afterwards proved to be the origin of my misfortunes . -- I was then in pretty good busineſs , & could have gone on very comfortably , if I had confided in Poſseſsion alone , & not 2 trusted to Hopes & Expectations . -- Mrs : Hope 's father had often declared , in her preference before marriage , that ſhe ſhould have a fortune of £5 . or 6000. and we expected to receive it , in case of a hearty Reconci l liation . An old Aunt of her 's , ( Coheireſs with her Mother , ) had often aſsured her ſhe would leave her £10,000 . -- and my father had given me reaſon to expect , ( by Articles he himself made with the Gentleman I enter 'd into partnerſhip with , in Trade , when I was but Twenty , ) that my Patrimony would , at a certain term of years , be doubled . -- With all theſe proſpects in View , & the numerous acquaintance we had , it was natural for young people to live in a ſtile of Life far beyond their Income . mean while , the old Aunt died without having made a Will ; -- The expected Reconciliation never took Place , and my dear Companion could wait for it no longer . -- I 'll ſend you with This two the Copies of two Letters ſhe wrote her Parents on that Subject , which ſhe certainly kept for my future juſtification ; and which I now preſerve for the Satisfaction of my Children , leſt they may hereafter be told , that their mother 's Death was occaſion 'd by a conſtitutional 3 Disorder ; whereas , theſe Letters ſhew that the Cause proceeded from the conſtant operation of real Sorrow ; and for when ſhe wrote these Copies contrary to her custom ſhe muſt certainly have had her End in meditation . -- Since we could not paſs this melancholy Subject unnoticed , & I have been obliged to apply to my Papers concerning It , I will ſend you the whole Collection . -- The mentioning of it , now , only adds a little to my ſerious Reflection ; which is not far from being painful , when I consider that the peruſal of m th e affecting narration may afford Inſtruction to an a young & unexperienced Friend . -- You 'll find , among theſe Papers , a Letter of my dear friend 's from Bath , and her laſt one from Brockhall in this County , two days before her Death ; -- both preſerv 'd , to prove the Copies of her Letters to her Parents to be her own handwriting ; -- you 'll next find a Letter from me , with an Account of the Cause of her Death ; written to a Clergyman in Holland , & which I deſired he might return to me ; to contribute towards the future ſatisfaction of my Children ; -- and you 'll alſo read a Letter from our moſt intimate Friend Mr : Bayne , 4 ( a moſt worthy young man , now in the E : Indies , ) which he was ſo kind as to write to me in Scotland , to reconcile me to myself after her Death ; -- of which I could not help conſidering myself as the unfortunate Causer Author -- Peace to her good Soul ! for I have not forgot it yet ; tho ' often I have attempted it in the Arms of Beauty , and as often wiſh 'd my Mary 's Mind was there . -- And thence , my dear Miſs Hamilton , ſprung another cause of my Misfortunes . In the Winter after my Loſs , & on my Return to London , my Companions , perceiving my melancholy but little diminiſh 'd , imagined , the Amusements & Diſsipation of the Town , would be moſt conducive to banish my Sorrow . -- They accordingly plunged me headlong into them ; & my friend , who wrote the inclosed Letter , was the firſt to ſhew me the way . -- I found the wish 'd -for Relief . What my ſmall ſhare of Religion & Philosophy could not effect , was operated by Diſsipation ; & a conſtant repetition of ſuch a palatable & palliative Medicine , by degrees perform 'd a Cure ; -- ſo far at leaſt , as to prevent my Mind from dwelling 5 dwelling on the Recoll e ction of happier Days ; -- for ſtill they will occur to my Memory , when I am left without attachment to ſome female friend . -- I conſider I am writing to a woman of understanding , who has read of the World , though ſhe has ſ yet ſeen little of it ; or I would not thus hazard her good opinion by a confeſsion of my Sins . -- Mrs : Hamilton , too , muſt be indulgent to my weakneſs , & consider me leſs as an impoſtor than a fool ; -- and indeed my whole Life has been folly & extravagance ; & , on reflecting on it , this narration ought rather to be term 'd , an Account of the Cauſes of my failing in Life , than a Justification of my Conduct . -- My Relations , however , have aſsiſted in handing me down a few Steps of the Ladder , 'till , with my feet , I have reach 'd the Ground . -- But that part of the Subject I ſhall ſleep on to-night . -- I 'll only add a ſhort application to the above part of my Tale : -- It teaches us , that there is no ſolid Conſolation under the Afflictions of this Life , but in a virtuous Life Conduct & a constant resignation to the divine Will . -- 6 . Monday morng . I might have ſpared myself the Moral at the bottom of the laſt Page , for on reading over again my dear Miſs H : 's Letter , I find I have ſtolen the Reflection from her . But I confounded my head ſo much with reading all day , that it was no wonder my invention , Evening was not very bright in the Evening . -- To proceed with my Story . -- My Relations , rather than let the County of Linlithgow go out of the Family , got me elected to repreſent it . -- But there was a Petition preſented to the House of Commons againſt the Legality of my Election ; and in consequence of That I had to keep a Carriage , for two Winters , to drive about in , to viſit the great people & to ſolicit Votes ; and I had to thruſt myself as much as poſsible into company , & to ſ l give Entertainments ; -- for all which I was allow 'd by my Relations by but £200 . pr : Ann : I was thus led into expenſive Connexions that I could not afterwards ſo ſpeedily get rid of , without having been allow 'd a proper any other compensation , by my friends , than as above named ; but who , on the contrary , have deserted me , because I would not give my Vote in the House of Commons agreeable with their ſelfish Views . That is really the Case ; for motives of public benefit , they can have none , for deserting me ; -- on the contrary , I have a Letter from Lord Hope ( written at the time when the preſent minister was not expected to ſtand , ) expreſsing , in the warmeſt manner , his approbation of my voting according to Conſcience during the time I ſat in Parliament , was it but for two months . -- Here you ſee my private Reaſon for publiſhing the political Letters I ſhew 'd you . -- When a man talks much about himself , it is either from Vanity , or a consciousness that his Conduct ſtands in need of Justification : -- I foreſaw my Affairs would one day come to this Criſis ; & I was willing , therefore , to bespeak the pity of the Public , ( if I could not procure their forgiveneſs , ) for my Follies . -- But I made no comment on my Letters ; I was unwilling needleſsly to expoſe my Relations ; -- if I had acted vindictively & offenſively , inſtead 8 of being upon the Defenſive , I ſhould have added Lord Hope 's Letter to my Publication , which , without ſerving myself , would have injured perhaps have materially injured him . -- His aim is , to get a British Peerage ; & , to obtain That , his father & Him muſt prove the ir ſincerity of their Attachment to the Court , by abandoning me & ſhewing a lasting & public Resentment & public Disapprobation of my political Conduct . I ſhall I am thus become a Victim to Ambition . -- But they will never gain their Ends . I know too well in what Light our Family is looked upon at Court , to expect they 'll be ſhewn any favour . -- I have told them ſo , formerly ; but they thought me a young Politician , & would not believe me . -- You are younger ſtill ; but you may gain more credit ; you have a Vote in the County belonging to your family ; -- Suppoſe you were to write a Letter to Lord Hope , to the following purport ; -- it might have ſome effect in my favour , & could not poſsibly be ill taken ; -- if they were before unacquainted with the Circumſtance , it may open their Eyes as to the Intereſt 9 Intereſt , they may ſuppoſe , to they have with his Majesty 's favourite ; -- if in This I ask any thing improper for a young Lady to grant , Mrs : Hamilton will be able to judge , & will forgive me the Liberty I have taken ; ſince I was deſired to point out in what you could be of use to Me . -- Now , for the proposed Letter : -- “ My Lord , -- My mother & I having “ ſent to your Couſin Mr : Hope , who is now “ confined here for Debt , to know in what “ we could ſerve him ; he returned me , in “ Anſwer , his Requeſt , that I would write “ your Lordship the following Anecdote , which “ he thought might poſsibly be of use in removing “ one cause of the displeaſure of his Relations , “ arising to from the part he took in parliament “ contrary in oppoſition to their political “ friends . -- At the time of Mr : Hope “ Weir 's laſt Election for the County of “ Linlithgow , Several People in ye Court interest came “ to my father , with an expreſs requeſt , from “ Lord Bute , that if he would not vote “ for Sir Willm : Cuningham , he would be 1 0 “ neuter , & would not give his Vote for Mr : Hope -- “ Forgive , My Lord , the Liberty I have “ taken , with the ſole view of ſerving a friend “ in need , ” & c a : & c a : & c : -- I have given you the matter only , my dear Miſs Hamilton , & you will expreſs it in your own Words . -- I gave you , in my laſt , a poetical Description of my Confinement ; but , I can aſsure you , it is far from Distreſs . -- I am very well lodged ; and have a fine pleaſant Bowling Green , to walk on as much as I pleaſe . -- I am lodged at the Bowling Green Houſe , oppoſite the old Castle Walls . -- Pray ſend , to Mr : Wye 's , your own choice of a French , a Dutch , & an Italian Book ; & he will forward them hence . -- The Lines , I ſent you , Mrs : Dicey inſiſted on printing ; & they will be deſtributed among Acquaintances to- night . I can not find all the Papers I wanted to ſend you ; -- as they are not in my Portefeuille , I must have left them looſe in my Bureau at Mr : Wye 's ; -- you ſhall have them at another time ( thoſe that are wanting ; -- ) mean while I 11 I have ſupplied their Place with others , that will give equal Illucidation , as to the circumſtances of my dear friend 's Death , & the ſocial manner in which we liv 'd together . -- Indeed , my dear Miſs Hamilton , who ever ventures upon me again for Life , muſt resemble her in character , or I ſhall ne'er be happy . -- Forgive me touching on that String again , ( I ſometim es can not help it ; -- ) it made every Nerve of me thrill again this morning , or you would have receiv 'd this Letter before Dinner . -- I made a Pauſe , & took a ſolitary Walk in the Bowling Green , to drive away the Reflections occaſion 'd by the opening these Papers . -- Mrs : Dicey found me there , & prevented me proceeding in the morning . -- After Dinner , I recollected it was Aſsembly Night , & I reſolved not to ſadden the Mirth of the Evening . -- It next ſtruck me , that my melancholy Tale might haunt your Dreams & disturb your Reſt ; which prevents me from sending it 'till to morrow morning . -- As it my Will is , These ſheets ſhould be preſerved , -- I date , ſign , & direct it them in due form . Dear Miſs Hamilton -- Your obliged & affecte : friend John Hope Northampton -- Monday 8 th - March 1773 Docr : Bleneve was with me all this Evening , & I am pleased to find him gain upon me as we are more acquainted . -- This Paper to be preserved and return 'd to the Author , if demanded by him .
