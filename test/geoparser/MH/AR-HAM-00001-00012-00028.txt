My dear Miſs Hamilton I just add a few Lines to say , Prince Alfred has a Rash , since Sunday Morning , his Royl Highneſs is perfectly well with it , & Hawkins says it will rather be of Service to him then otherwise . The Uneasineſs he had on Saturday Friday was probably owing to the Rash being coming out . Ever most Sincerely Yrs . C Finch I made out all my News to Pſs Augusta for her Letter Queen 's Houſe . Monday Evening Decbr : 11 th : 1780 To Miſs Hamilton Queen 's Lodge Windsor
