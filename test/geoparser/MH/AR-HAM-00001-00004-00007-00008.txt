Royal hotel Pall Mall Friday 13 th My Dear Mrs Dickenson , Had I not been confined for the last three weeks to my room with a violent cold and fever , I should certainly have written to you before to tell you all about my Marriage , as I am Vain enough to think that after our very long acquaintance you are kind enough as to interest yourself about every One of us . My wedding took place in such a hurry that I had time for nothing or else believe me you should have been acquainted with my intentions , especially as I understand that there is some kind of connection between you & Mr. Hamilton 's family , at least so Mr. Cathcart made out one day at Swanburne if so I am indeed greatly flattered at the chance , which has made me claim a relationship with you , and if poſsible I now feel more warmly then ever the friendship which I have always had for each individual of your family . When I left Swanburne , I gave Justine Strict orders to send you favours , but I find that so few were sent from London that the people present run away with the whole Stock , you must however take the will for the deed and allow me to aſsure You that tho ' I have seen so little of you for some Year 's past that I can never forget the kindneſs you shewed us when at Linslade . Justine joins with me in best love to yourself Mr. Dickenson and our Old friend Louisa , Mr. Hamilton begs me to add that he will be most Anxious to be introduced to you and that he is Most Proud at the honor of being related to One who he knows has always proved such a Sincere friend to his little Wife Ever believe me Dear Mrs- Dickenson , Your 's Very Sincerely Harriet Hamilton Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire Mrs. James Hamilton Answered Janry 1809
