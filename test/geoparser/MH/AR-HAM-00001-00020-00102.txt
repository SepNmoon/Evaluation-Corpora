Greencroft 7 th . Septr- 1787 . Baby Gazette Extraordinary We have the pleasure to inform our correspondents that Lord Napier , tho ' not two Years old , Walks as well as her Mother , says every thing that any body else can say & holds a conversation with regularity & spirit . The Master of Napier is a prodigy -- Ten Months old -- poſseſses Six Teeth , -- stands & has walked alone & promises to unite in himself all the amiable qualities of the houses of Napier & Clavering . Miſs Napier purposes taking her departure from Axwell Park the 27 th . of this Month . She goes to Edinr . to collect Feathers & pick Straws in order to form her nest , to be in readineſs for the Hatching which is to take place in her Ladyship 's family next Decr- or January . The Right Honble The Lady Napier talks of keeping his Gander Month in the Antient Capital of the Antient Kingdom of Caledonia -- The production expected soon to appear as an addition to the House of Merchiston , is confidently aſserted to be of the Feminine Gender . The Sponsors in contemplation are , Lord Napier of Greencroft Esq r George Clavering of Taxal & Mrs- Dickenson of Stratford Place . Finis My Dear Sister , Having in the Gazette given you a full detail of the Infantry it is time to tell you how pleased I am at the good accounts you send me of your little Mrs- Pechell . I need not say how happy it would make Us , could You & Louisa straggle ( to make use of a genteel word ) as far as Edinburgh . You may beleive , were we to penetrate as far as London , we would endeavour to visit at Taxal . I should very much enjoy the countenances of the two Mothers , viewing each others productions , seeking for the blemishes & paſsing over the beauties of the poor Infants , submitted to their inspection . But alas , there is no probability of our meeting for some time . My cruel Lawsuit still exists & has caused me much vexation & has cost me upwards of Seven Hundred Pounds . This , with the expence of my Journey from Ireland , & the purchase & furnishing of our House , has left me entirely pennyleſs . My Lawyers flatter me , that next term may conclude the busineſs ; but , I put no faith in their expectations having been already so frequently disappointed . I beleive , in the end I shall receive about Three Thousand Pounds which will do more than pay off my personal Debts contracted by Military Purchases before Marriage . As for my entailed Debts , I beleive I shall leave them to my Son Mr. D . to get rid of the best way he can . I can not exactly say whether William is the Author of the Book you mention . His name is Dr. Hunter . The title page will perhaps point out to You whether it is his Reverence or not -- I shall give your Meſsage to Andrew when we meet , & if ever You & I should be together again , I will give You a full account of the confusion which arose in My Sister s brain on Mrs- Hunter 's being originally announced to her She & D r . regretted his departure from th r - The Doctor has lately discovered a Lime Rock on one of his Estates for which the Tenant s already pays £250 pr . Ann . A comfortable addition to their Income . Mr. Wm- Dickenson left her Sister with every proper decency . We go on very well together . I never approved of her living with Harriot as it prevented her mixing with such company as I wished her to keep , Mrs- H . visiting nobody . Her health for many Years has been precarious & she has got into a habit of indolence & indulgence which has not made her better . She has three Children alive . One Boy & two Miſses . I beg my best wishes to Mrs- H . Tell him , I share in the satisfaction You must all have received from his father 's recovery . We have for this Month past had the entire care of Mr. D . , his Rib having taken herself to Harrowgate . She returns about the 25 th - & then I shall be in a hurry to get home . Sir Thos . Clavering has been invited to confine herself at Axwell Park , & has had hints thrown out of a desire to adopt the Child . I set all these things down to the account of fine Speeches & have hitherto declined the offer . Maria begs to join in sincere love & good wishes to you & Yours . Ever my Dear Sister your faithfull & affectionate Brother Maria Durham September eighth 1787 N— Taxal Chapel le Frith Derby Free Mrs- Dickenson .
