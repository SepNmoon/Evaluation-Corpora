My dear Madam , The remembrance of the misunderstanding you allude to is very distreſsing to me , I wish I had acted with more coolneſs ; the past can not be recall 'd but I beg you will aſsure Mr. Dickenson that I am equally desirous with him that the unfortunate subject shou 'd hereafter be buried in oblivion ; & consequently be no more touch 'd upon . I have been much out of order for some time past , but am now considerably better , & enjoy much comfort from the society of Mrs. Holman . My mind is as yet too much distracted to think of visiting my friends , in deed I have so much busineſs upon my hands , that I cou 'd not with p r opriety be absent from my present residence even for a short time . I have not only to struggle with the great misfortune that has lately befallen me , but I am also at this time surrounded by various domestic grievances , & these bearing upon me at my advanced period of life , occupy my mind with unpleasing reflexions , which I do not poſseſs sufficient strength to exclude . I hope Mrs. Holman will not think of leaving me soon , unleſs upon better prospects ; she poſseſses a strong mind & much patience , for which she has great occasion . I have consider 'd that every distreſs that may aſsail her husband , must fall equally upon her , I have therefore determin 'd to consult her interest in all future occurrences respecting him . I hope to be able to do something for my daughter , but that at all events must not be subject to his control . Having sufficiently tried your patience , I have only to beg the favor that you will present my respects to Mr. Dickenson & my love to my God Daughter , I remain My dear Madam , Your faithful and affectionate humble Servant Frederick Hamilton n o . 1 Brock St . Bath Feby . 20 th . 1807 . My dear cousin , I conclude , by my not hearing from you , that you suspected my stay at Bath would be prolonged ; and I am sure , from the extreme kindneſs you and Mr : Dickenson have shown me , that you will be glad to hear that my dear Father is not at all inclined to part with me ; but , on the contrary , wishes me to remain with him as long as I conveniently can . You will easily believe , my dearest Cousin , how happ y I am , to be able , in any degree , to alleviate his sad situation ; and the great satisfaction I have in perceiving , that he is certainly better than I found him , on my arrival . I was going to write to you to-day , and to leave him room for a postscript ; but , was agreeably surprised by hearing that he felt well enough to write the former part of the letter ; which I am sure , you will rejoice at . I should have written to you sooner , but that I thought I might perhaps have a letter from you , forwarded from London . I dare say , you gueſsed that matters would turn out as they have , respecting my stay . Pray remember me most affectionately to Mr : Dickenson , and my Cousin Louisa ; and believe me , ever , with the highest obligation for all your kindneſs , and the truest regard and esteem , your very affectionate J : Holman . P.S . I am in daily expectation of a letter from Mr : H . Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire
