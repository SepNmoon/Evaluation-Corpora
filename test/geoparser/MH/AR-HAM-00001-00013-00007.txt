M y I have this moment received my dear Miranda s letter ; & I am very sorry She shou 'd have cause to think herself neglected by those who love her . -- I must take upon me to acquit our friends at the Cottage , for they have left the Dale above a Month ago ; & to my certain knowledge they have writ several times , & by them I have sent my excuses ; but I am sorry to say that family affairs have effected our spirits so much that we cou 'd not persuaid our selves to put pen to paper I have never seen your Dear friend Leonidas so much out of spirits , since I have had the honor to be connected to him ; this is under the rose -- At present our House is full , the Bulls Croſs family & Mr. Mckonishie , I hope the latter will be with us for some time , I flatter my Self it will doe Mr. G : a great deal of good ; & how happy shall we be to see you at Sunning hill ; Mr. Glover & his friend M : is gon to a Sale this Morning , a Mr. Wm . Pitt , wee all whent last Tuesday , & I bought a Carpet . I greatly rejoice that you are once more a free Woman ; that Affair hurt Mr. G : very much at the time ; if he dont return too late for the Post , I will get him to write a few lines in the frank ; I am sorry to say that every disagreeable thing puts him out of sorts now , which was once not the case -- But with pleasure I can inform you he Drinks the Waters with great suckceſs . -- & I hope in time he will get the better of those things that now hurt him . Mary desires her love , She behaves her Self very well , & I hope forever will ; I shall not conclude without leting you know that I am certain , that I shall love you to the last period of my life .
