Bristol July 16 th - 1784 Be aſsured my dear Friend , I take the most lively interest in all your concerns . Judge then how very agreeable to me was your last letter which gives me an aſsurance that you are in a train to be lastingly happy . How I rejoyce in your joy ! I am impatient to know more , and cou 'd almost q uarrel with you for cramming so interesting so important an information into so small a compaſs ; I dont wonder that this agreeable meeting with the favour 'd Young Lover put the old o ne as much out of your head as he had ever been out of your heart , and yet I had some curiosity for the detail you had promised me of the splendid offers and pertinacious attachment of the poor rejected Swain . But you now so engaged in happier prospects that I dare say you have not only forgotten his pro spect posals , but almost his existence . You have my hearty and warm wishes that your present agreeable prospects may give even more than they promise and that you may enjoy with the Man of your choice ( whom I am prepared to love and esteem ) all the happineſs that this world in its very best estate can bestow , in waiting for that perfection of goodneſs and of happineſs which is not to be found till we come to a better World . It gives me pride as well as pleasure to be remember 'd by my Lord Stormont . He is a little wicked tho ' about Made . de Genlis whom you saucily call by the name of my friend . I do indeed admire her Talents ; I feel in my heart a natural propensity to love ingenious persons with an Enthusiasm which I am often , to my great sorrow , obliged to lower considerably when I come to know their private history . But can this Woman be such an Advocate for Virtue , if she has really no principles ? and can I really be such a fool to ask that question , I who have read so many books written by people whose whole li f v es have given the lie to their writings . -- Lord S—— s subject of the Cloke wou 'd really be an excellent one , tho I hope not apply 'd to this Lady , but to any hypocrite , but then it must be written by a Man , for there is a sort of writing which tho very innocent , yet requires a Spirit and a hardineſs which never sit well on a Woman ; this in my notion is the case with all satire and all Comedy : You cou 'd not name to me one of either of these however excellent that I wou 'd wish to have written , no not to have acquired the laurels , I dont mean of Juvenal or Congreve , but of the most decent comic or Satiric poet that ever lived Pray tell Mr. Walpole that neither the outside nor inside of my head acquired any thing by my stay at Oxford , and I came away without either wig or Wisdom ; but had it been otherwise I wou 'd have renounced all the honours they have to bestow ed for the pleasure of spending the day you describe at Strawberry Hill . He is very good i s n his generous wishes towards my poor Louisa and pray tell him that I will thankfully accept of him a guinea a Year , but no more , towards her support . -- The unfortunate Creature is much the same as usual , rather better in health , rather worse in Mind -- Pray let me know if you hear Miſs Gregory s marriage is likely to be forgiven , by Mrs. M . -- where she lives and what is her new name . Let me know if my dear Mrs. Vesey is still in Town and how she does , and write soon to your affectionate H More I had looked out Mr. Walpole 's sweet Verses to send you , and now have mislaid them -- Pray send the inclosed to Mrs. Ord
