Edinr- 30 th . Septr- 1779 My Dear Sister , When I wrote last to you I was out of temper , & for that reason incapable of answering some questions in your letter so calmly as I should have done . Never was poor Devil so tormented as I have been & still continue to be -- from an exceſs of prudence & delicacy , I may happen to loſs lose the object of my wishes . Under a promise of Silence 'till an answer is received from Genl . L . in America , I can not addreſs Miſs L . at a time when I have some small reason to suspect a rising attachment in her breast in favor of a Young Earl , & that attachment strengthened by the advice of her Cousin and Confidant . If this appears to gain ground it will be neceſsary for me to take the field , at any rate my resolution is fixed of finishing the matter one way or other before I leave Scotland , which I hope will be in a short time as I have a promotion Treaty in great forwardneſs -- that is to say I hope it will take place in about Six Weeks . Do not suspect me of being jealous . My information comes from too good a quarter , no leſs a personage than Ly- Hopetoun who is her Aunt as well as m y i ne & who wishes me well -- You see the scrape , I have got into , it will require great addreſs & ingenuity to get out again , more I fear than I am Master of -- however Fortune favors the brave & I wo n't be cast down -- I am just returned from a Visit to my Estate -- the first time of my appearance there . No house of my own to lodge in , tho I have two Castles without side Walls , Roofs , Windows , Doors or floors . Next Summer my intention is to build , not a palace but a Cottage -- Lofty green hills at the back which are to be planted , a flat in River in the front , the opposite side of the River rising into Mountains likewise to be planted & the ruin of an Old Castle at the foot of one of them , which will be a principle object from the House . I hope some day or other to see you in it . Adieu Yours Affecty- N—— .
