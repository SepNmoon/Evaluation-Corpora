Copy of my letter to Mr & Mrs. Smelt March 7 th - 1789 sent 9 th -- Though it is long since I have heard from or written to my dear & respected friends . I am as equally persuaded of the constancy of their regard & good wishes towards me as I am certain of the constancy of my attachment towards them -- I am now animated to break through the silence wch . has prevailed between us , by the desire of communicating to them how my heart glows with Rapture at the happy thrice happy restoration of our beloved and good King s health -- God has been exceedingly gracious towards us , he has relieved us from our Sorrow -- may we have a just sense of the bleſsing he has vouchsafed to restore to us , & merit that our amiable sovereign may very long continue to reign over these kingdoms -- few , very few of his Subjects ( comparatively speaking ) I believe are so senseleſs as not to feel & acknowledge the goodneſs of Almighty God in the Recovery of his Majesty -- I have strongly felt all that I knew the Queen must suffer , & prayed fervently for a mitigation of her troubles -- bleſsed be God they are not only now mitigated but ended ; deeply has she drank of the bitter cup of Affliction -- may She never again taste it . Her Majesty has ever set a bright example to the female Sex of every moral virtue by acting with undeviat ing propriety -- She has now shewn them what advantages are to be reaped from christian piety , which has so enabled her to bear up under the preſsure of a grievous trial & affliction with proper resignation to the divine will , & supported her to fulfill her duties in an exemplary manner when her heart was pierced by the most poignant Anguish . I heard from my dear friend Ly Cremorne lately who had had the honor & satisfaction of seeing her Majesty , that she thought her the Queen looked like one who had gone through much trouble and was thinner -- it will make me very happy if you can tell me that her health is not materially injured . & that she has recovered her looks with her happineſs -- also that the Princeſses have not suffered in their 's from their late affliction -- This question I likewise ask you my dear friends , for I well know how deeply you have been affected . I beg you will remember me kindly to Mrs. Cholmondley of whom I hope you will be able to send me good Accounts . Mr. Dickenson desires you will accept his affe . Respects . our little Girl is in perfect health , & delights our hearts , by seeming to have ( as far as one can judge at her tender age ) an amiable affecte . disposition -- Pray give my love to Miſs Burney , & tell her I shd . be glad to hear of her health from herself -- are not you as well as Miſs B . glad that Miſs Port is married ? I have not yet heard any particular relative to Mr. Warrddington , but I have no doubt Mr . & Mrs. Granville made a prudent choice . I shall esteem it a favor if you will present my Comps . to ye- Ladies of my acquaintance at the Palace when you have an Opporty ; and desire you will remember us very affy to our dear Mrs. Orde & Miſs Orde . I remain ever my dearest Mr . & Mrs. Smelt 's Sincere & Affe . friend Mary Dickenson Taxal 7 March 1789 Mr. D & myself shall be happy to hear the Montagu 's are well we spent a very agreeable day at Sandleford in the autumn pray present our kind Compliments to them --
