Kinsale 22 nd : July 1786 . My Dear Sister -- ( I ought to have begun Madam -- for on looking at the date of your last Letter I find 20 th . March 1786 staring at the head of the Page ) if you are still in the land of the living be so good as to inform me what is the reason you have not done me the Honor to acknowledge my last letter written in the beginning of April ? I presume the cares of this World have so much increased , that not a moment can be spared to enquire after your wandering Friends . I now desire a Categorical Answer to the following Question viz -- Is it Peace or War between Us ? If War , be it so . If Peace , I am directed to request You to take upon Yourself the office of Sponsor to my Daughter which is to be born early in October next . Harriot will aſsist You . If the Brat should prove a Male , I can not trust him to your Tuition , fearfull that he might by following your example become as Saucy as Yourself , the natural consequence of which to him would be broken bones . I am not under the same apprehensions with regard to a Daughter , for it is now quite fashionable and consequently neceſsary for all Miſses to be as pert & disagreable as poſsible . It is now time to tell You that the abovenamed Honor is unattended with the usual expence as all Christening Money is abolished in my family . We moved our Quarters from Cork to Charles Fort near this town last May . A change we have had great reason as to be satisfied with , as we have got an excellent house in the Town & have the satisfaction of breathing pure Air , a comfort not to be expected in the Town of Cork , which is without exception the filthiest hole I ever put my foot in . What will become of Us next Spring is very uncertain . My Regiment is the first ffor foreign Services & we hope it 's destination will be Canada or Nova Scotia . If my Lt Colonel chuses to stay at home , I must go out with the Regt- & in that case Maria will accompany Me . A trip acroſs the Atlantic will be no inconvenience to her after twice croſsing the Pacific . I shall however regret such an expedition as it will prolong my Absence from Britain for at least two Years more . I really begin now to wish to see the Inhabitants of the other Island , as I think there is great danger of Our becoming White Boys & Savages like the miserable Inhabitants of this oppreſsed Country . The state of the common people is miserable beyond conception . The folly , extravagance & absurdity of their betters is scandalous . I honestly confeſs it to be my firm beleive , that some very unpleasant convulsion must happen in Ireland before many years paſs on . Tythes are the present griev an ce complained of by the White Boys and I am sorry to add that there is too much reason to suspect that these deluded people are supported in secret to by persons of some degree of consequence . Was it otherways , there it would be impoſsible for them to collect together armed in such large Bodies as they constantly do ; commit depradations on their peacable Neighbours , & escape undiscovered . What does Lord Cremorne say on this Subject ? Maria joins me in every affectionate Wish for Yourself & Mr. Dickenson . I ever remain My Dear Sister , Your faithfull & affectionate Brother Napier .
