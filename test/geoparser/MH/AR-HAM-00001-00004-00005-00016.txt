These I entreat if you do not think it improper to present to Her Majesty the Queen . one I dare s not ( nor am I in a situation ) to present things of value to any Sovereign , but these being curious tho ' a mere trifle I hope ( by your manner of presenting them ) she will not be offended at the liberty I take , let me hear from you I entreat , & when you see Ly . King tell her how much I love her & her family & that I will write when I am a little stronger you may see by my hand how weak I am -- but thank God I am gaining gr ound . Sr. Wm . desires his kind love & I am ever yours with true Affection C Hamilton Taranto April 10 th via Naples To Miſs Hamilton S t James 's Palace Ostende London Sir Wm- & Lady Hamilton s letters to their neice Miſs Hamilton
