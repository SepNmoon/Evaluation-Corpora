Tewin Water , 5 th . Septr- 1782 . My Dear Sister is in the right . It will ever be gratefull for me to know that She is well & that she forgets me not . Long may your good health continue : and undisturbed may our Friendship be . Your situation must have been truly distreſsing during the young Prince 's illneſs . The news papers found it convenient to kill Prince William -- I am glad , without foundation . They have now broke the Scull of a certain Heir Apparent . If it is cracked , I hope a gleam of Common Sense will force its way thro ' the crevice , and show him the impropriety of being connected with his present Companions . I would not have him haughty , but there is a dignity he ought to support , which would reflect more lustre upon his Character and would make him more respected even by his riotous aſsociates . Every man owes something to himself . If he forgets to respect himself , it can not be supposed that he will be respected . Since I wrote to You last I have been in London to My busineſs was to offer my Services at Gibraltar . General Conway advised me to give up the idea . His reasons were , that I could not have a command in the Garrison , consequently would be an idle Spectator or a Spunger at the Governor 's table . And secondly that if Ld . Howe 's fleet ever arrived there , the Seige must of course be raised . This he said was his opinion , but if I insisted upon going , he would not oppose me . I told him my intention was , to be entirely guided by hi m s Advice . He then added that he would advise me to return to my Recruiting Quarters and endeavour to raise Men for the Service which would be of more real use than any I could poſsibly be of at Gibraltar from my personal exert ions I mentioned to You before that he had never answered the letter I wrote to him , applying for Promotion . Upon my leaving him he told me he had not answered my Letter because it had not been yet in his power to do so effectually . I do not however build upon this Speech . The Dowager is well and lively . I hope to be so soon , as I have at last got once more on Horseback . The want of that exercise was attended with an oppreſsion on my Chest . The only chest that now suffers is my money Chest . I grow thin , which rather pleases me . Adieu . Beleive me ever your very sincere friend and affectionate Brother N——
