Taxal June 16 th : 1775 My dear Miſs Hamilton I am always in my Penitentials , when I write to you : I know , I am the worst Correspondent in the World , & that , I do not deserve to hear from you ; this makes me quite asham 'd of myself , whenever you are so obliging to favour me with a Letter . you ' l say then , that I ought immediatly to set about answering it . very true ; but I have added ingratitude to neglect in not returning Mrs : Hamilton & yourself my best thanks for your great Civilities to Jack , & the good Opinion you are so obliging to entertain of him . He is at present a Dutiful good Lad , & I hope will continue so , & be a comfort to his Friends , the Notice you took of him made full amends for the Mortifications he sufferd from other circumstances in his Visit to Northampton . & he is at length return 'd full of Acknowledgements for your Politeneſs & Hospitality . & desires me to present his best Compts : to you both . but I believe he intends to send you a few lines in this Frank which I shall inclose . I am sorry to hear any thing has happend to give you uneasineſs ; you have too much tenderneſs in your disposition & I have often thought on this occation that the lot of human Happineſs is more equally dispens 'd than People generally I m agine , & that the dull & insensible tho ' incapable of the refined pleasures of friendship do at least paſs through the World with more ease to themselves , than they whose delicate sensibilities make them so deeply affected with the loſs o r distreſs of every Friend in a World where there are so many opportunities to grieve than to rejoyce . I have not yet look 'd among my old Friend s Letters since she died . I intend to do it very soon , & will send you one or two of them , but I find myself utterly incapable of drawing a Character , tho it was what I always wishd I coud have been Mrs : of . if you have any Talent that way I beg you will exert & improve it for it is both entertaining & useful . we have got very sultry hot Weather which disagrees with me exceſsively & I am but very lame & poorly at prest . but I hope when it is more moderate I shall be better . Mr D : joynes me in Compts : to good Mrs : Hamilton & yourself & beg you will believe me Your sincere friend S Dickenson I am sorry you are removing so fa r off us , but it wd : give me pleasure to hear you had fixd yourselves agreeably . as I do not know whether Mr : Lawton be returnd from London I shoud take it as a favour ( if he is not ) that you give leave for your Servt : to put the inclos 'd into the Post Office . Miſs Hamilton Northampton
