Wilton Lodge 24 th . Novr . 1791 . My Dear Sister , I do n't mean to be troublesome , but not having heard from You for about Eight Months , I can not help once more directing a Letter to Taxall , merely to know , whether You are Dead or Alive ? If defunct , why e'en rest in Peace , but if in Existence , You will not easily procure a pardon for neglecting Me so long . Methinks , you might have taken some notice of the letter I wrote , the 21 st . of last Month , announcing the birth of another Daughter , even tho ' you did not chuse to acknowledge that I sent you last March , I think . But , perhaps , this may be treated in the same way , I shall therefore conclude , with my best wishes to Mr. Dickenson & your little Girl , who have not affronted Me , & as for Yourself , You may either take my best wishes or let them alone , as seemeth best unto You . Farewell . Napier .
