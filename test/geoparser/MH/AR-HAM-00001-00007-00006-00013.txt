Sun : Evg : A thousand Thanks to you my Dr . Madam for indulging me with the Perusal of 2 Such Letters . I am much amus 'd with both , but greatly struck with the Superiority of Mrs : Carter 's Stile . it is so plain so simple & what my poor Dr Provost us 'd to call so chaste . I think Mrs Moore is rather too diffuse , but her Criticisms are Very Just . if Miſs Pulteney should be as compleatly dégourdi , as a young Lady of my Acquaintance was by going to the Same Convent , I shall think they have an infallible Recipe for the Care of awkward Girls ; she was Very thick , Very short neck 'd , & clumsy , when she went ; but return 'd , in leſs than 2 Years , one of the genteelest Figures I ever saw , but I never could get her to own , what Sort of Screw Preſs she had been put into . Adieu -- I can not say au Revoir , because I never see you at all .
