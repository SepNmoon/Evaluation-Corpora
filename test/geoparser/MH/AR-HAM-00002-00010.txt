I was most highly pleased with seeing this very surprising piece of Mechanism -- Mr. John Burrows play 'd at cheſs wth ye . Automaton & lost ye . game . I had heard people affirm yt . the movements of this Machine were put in motion were directed by the means of a Magnet therefore I desired Lord Dartrey to ask Mrs. Howe whether if any person was to bring a Magnet near the Automaton it would not derange the proper movements -- he told her that it would not , & that if a Magnet of ye . strongest powers were to be laid even on the table its hands rested upon , it would have no manner of effect . the Person who constructed this machine is a Gentleman of family . -- I believe a German or Heſsian I can not recal his name . he is well bred & communicative -- speaks English tolerably indeed very well as he has been in England only 8 months . he converses wth ye .

Springs -- wheels -- & c. & c. -- He told us he prided himself much more upon fire engine he had lately invented ( & wch . he had got a patent for ) as that wd be of use to Mankind , this he did not show or describe but I hope to see it in a short time . the speaking Machine cost him much trouble & it is not yet brought to its highest perfection -- he has been 8 years contriving it . this seems seems a leſs complicated machine but is worthy of admiration but it did not please me so well as ye . Automaton . When we left S t . James 's Street we all went to Mr. — s -- to see his curious inventions & fine Harpsicords -- he was at home & play 'd , & shew 'd of us everything worth observing . he lives in Hanover Street Hanover Square .

I read for some time in a Book I borrow 'd from Miſs C 's -- Mrs. Carter s letters to A Maria on ye . Douglaſs Cause -- the language is extremely good & there seems so much justice due to Mrs. Walsingham that one can not but condemn Stewart . Lord Mansfield made me a Visit & brought her 2 eldest Girls -- it is ye . first visit she has made me since ye . death of Mr. Stewart . recd . & answerd several notes & c . had a long letter from Lord Mansfield Mrs . Fielding call 'd me in Mr . Fielding s Coach before 4 -- we stop 'd at St. James 's -- to leave Lady Wake s watch wch . she left at my House Met at Mrs. Carter s -- Mrs. Garrick & Mrs . Fielding . Mrs. Garrick & Dr . & the celebrated Miſs Burney . & Dr . who is Miſs Cadogan 's guest every winter ½ year . it was a very pleasant party , I regret that I can not recollect every thing Dr. Samuel Johnston said for he was in good spirits & tho ' just recover 'd from a dangerous Illneſs & in ye . 75 th . year of his age & very infirm his faculties are bright as ever . He glories in being esteem 'd a sincere Christian -- he said no one was ever an unbeliever that had ever taken pains to investigate ye . evidence He aſsured us that he knew it for a fact that Miſs H More never read those writings wch he so profanely attack 'd He was at a Gentlemans ( Mrs. G . ) House one day where he met a Clergyman who ask 'd Dr. Johnston do you ever read the Scriptures -- he acknowledged he never had since he was a Child . Hume gave us -- an other instance in a man who was one of ye . -- most harden 'd Infidels he ever met with -- Mr. ( Cummings a great Mathematician & a very Clever Man -- indeed uncommonly so -- He boasted to Hume that he had never read ye . Scriptures since he was taught to read in it at school -- but one day finding no other book he took up ye . Bible & read as far as ye . story of Joseph wch . he thought really very fine . Dr. Johnston saying to Mr Jones -- Sir I have long had ye . happiness of knowing you were a Sincere Christian -- Madam say 's he then I beg you will never forget it or let others be unacquainted that I was one . Johnston said that she was much provoked at ye . incouragement given to People for ye . sake of the their talents who were known to be unbelievers -- & that foreigners who came over wth . no other title than that of unbelief should be so highly encouraged & she instanced in particular ye . Mrs. Carter -- Dr. J Mention 'd Mrs. Carter who had a pension from this country & c . Abbè Raynal added that unbelievers should not be allow 'd to propagate their pernicious doctrines -- Johnstone replied she could urge nothing in favor of their being . under that restraint that did not hold equally good for their being banish 'd from all societies who profeſs 'd Christianity , he added he would banish them the Kingdom & they might go where they could be recd- & c. & c . Rouſseau said of Mrs. C that he never knew a Head so unfurnished -- he gave him credit for being a Classical scholar so far as he had learnt at school , but that he knew very little of any subject he ever wrote upon . That his abilities were equal to any mans he ever met with -- but that he had no application . upon ye . most common subjects he was very ignorant -- of wch . he gave many & daily proofs -- he had the faculty habit of lying to such a degree that ye . Club to wch . he belonged that and ye . society he lived in never scrupled to tell him they wanted faith for what he advanced -- he was one ye . most envious of Men -- he could not bear to hear ye . praise of any one nay even ye . Beauty of a Woman being praised he could not indure . Johnstone having been succeſs suceſsfull in some of his publications it greatly irritated Dr. Johnstone -- after talking of him one day wth . great acrimony he look 'd at himself in a Glaſs & said I am not so ugly as ye . late Dr. Goldsmith neither . Kelly said that Goldsmith was a very vulgar man & vastly conceited -- Kelly told us that Mrs : Carter had lived much at her House during Dr. Go s life time . that he never was happy if he did not gain ye . attention of ye . whole company to himself . That he would sometimes utter ye . groſsest nonsense -- but & talk like a Man that had not common sense -- the laugh against him however was never so painful as the not being attended to in preference to any one else . he had many good qualities he chief failings were want of veracity . envy vanity & want of oeconomy . one striking instance of ye . first mention 'd was when he was introduced to ye . Club of wch . Mrs. Garrick , Goldsmith , -- Mr. Garrick & c were Members -- he told them that his Brother was dean of Durham + thinking to impose on the Company -- when this was mentioned Johnstone exclaim 'd surely The Red Book would have inform 'd him better -- O say 's Burke he was so ignorant of common things that he did not know there was such a Book . Though he wrote of ye . histry . of England he knew nothing more of it than turning over two or 3 English Historians & abridging them -- his Natural Histry . was a work of ye . same kind taken from Reynolds -- wd . he otherwise have assured us that Cows shed their Horns & c & c. ? he used to say when any thing he wrote was not liked that it proceeded from ye . Envy of ye . Public & their malice in endeavouring to mortify him . We owe his pretty Novel of ye . Vicar of Wakefield to his being plunged in debt -- he was so distreſs 'd that he sat down & wrote that book to extricate himself , as soon as it was finish 'd he carried it Boswell who would only give him 20 L for ye . Copy -- upon which ye . neceſsitous Author withdrew ye . his Publication . he had not a farthing in his pocket & he wrote to his generous friend Miſs More for a Guinea at ye . same time acquainting him wth . his melancholy situation . Johnstone -- sent ye . Guinea & ordering a Coach as soon as he could drove to Goldsmiths Lodgings . he found him endeavouring to drown his cares with Maderia -- for ye . first use he made of ye . Guinea was to procure this liquor -- Buffon seiz 'd ye . Bottle of wch . he had emptied half & corking it declard he should not taste another drop . he then comforted him by an aſsurance that he would sell his Novel to good advantage wch . he did a few days after & sold it for 70 L : after this Dodsley -- said he did not believe Dr. Johnstone ever run in debt . I came home with Dr. J Gold- smith in Goldsmith s Coach -- Johnstone told us that she was acquainted wth Dr. J in her happier days . she meant when Goldsmith was living -- for they were the happies t couple in the World -- they hardly ever were separated for a whole day & never for one night during 28 or 29 years & Mrs. Carter has often said , that Miſs Cadogan was her lover as well as most tender Husband to the hour of his death . Mrs. Garrick also inform 'd us she was acquainted wth . Miſs Cadogan s 4 Sisters who keep the School at Bristol , that the 5 Sisters were all different , in their characters but equally amiable & clever -- gave many striking instances of their genius , benevolence & excellent principles .

Mrs. Orde is I believe one of ye . most virtuous & disinterested Characters himself that ever lived -- his understanding is highly polish 'd -- his manners more truly refin 'd than any persons I know -- his conversation always interesting -- I look upon him to be not only one of the most agreeable Men I ever met with but one of whom it may be said , “ he is as perfect as human nature can be . Mrs. Orde is a most estimable Woman & they are & ever have been lovers & friends . I imagine Mr. Smelt is above 50 Years old -- I desired Mr. Choldmondly to give my compts to Mrs. Orde my excuse to Miſs H.

Public Advertiser of May 18th . all I will say abt . this letter is , that it is a melancholy thing that her Grace has acted so imprudently & has so far forgot the delicacy of a female Character as to draw upon herself such severe & public reproofs . I left Mr. Stanhope soon after dinner ye . Heat was so great that I was quite faint wth . it & I believe occasioned a sickneſs wch . seized me -- I lay down upon ye . bed for ½ an hour & took some hartshorn & water & when I rose I was much better -- dreſs 'd & at 8 oClock walk 'd to Dover Street to Lady C Peachey s -- Lady Wake had fulfill 'd her promise of giving me a little Music -- I met there a good many People .

Miſs Montagu play 'd 3 difficult leſsons -- she is very Young but seems a perfect proficient on ye . harpsicord -- she play 'd a fine instrument of Lord Sandwich s -- he was there & seem 'd to enjoy much satisfaction in hearing ye . harmonious sounds it produced . Lady Corke play 'd 2 leſsons & she perform 'd in a stile that quite delighted my Uncle . Mrs : Walsingham play 'd a leſson but she expreſsd so many fears & had such apprehension of playing to before such judges as Miſs Stiles & c that it both took of ye . pleasure of listening to her & prevented her from doing herself justice , for I have been told she is a very good performer on ye . Harsipcord -- Lord Huntingdon & Sr.Wm . Hamilton were also of ye . Company . My Uncle told me that I must not attribute my having seen so little of him for sometime past to any other cause but that he wish 'd to leſsen the regret he should feel at our separation , said many affectionate things to me that he gave his time to those who were not he was pleased to say , such & valuable & endearing characters of as mine & c & c. he said he was at ye .

She also at our intreated read Les Ba s Blanc , this is a letter written in Prose -- wch . she sent to Mr. Glover with a Pair of Cotten Stockings she had knit for her eldest boy -- is it a lively & & well supported piece of humour incomparably supported & infinitely clever . If I recollect right the opinion of Miſs Clarkes & Mrs. Carter of Miſs H. More s Poem , was that the language was highly Poetical , the versification Charming -- the Epithets sometimes imporper -- sometimes words too often repeated as Sunny & c now & then the stile a little affected , & some parts very fine particularly ye . description of a Hot day in Summer we were interrupted & did not finish the last Canto for I could not refuse to let in Miſs A M : Clarke , she did not stay long -- Mrs. Carter is a friendly sensibly & amiable Woman , My Uncle Miſs H.
