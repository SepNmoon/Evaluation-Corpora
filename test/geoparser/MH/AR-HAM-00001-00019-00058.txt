Edinburgh Decr . 17 th - 1773 I am extremely concerned to find that I have lost Miſs Hamilton s confidence & more so to find that she has done any thing she ſeems to be asham 'd off tho I suſpect she may be trying me but let that be as it may I shall be extremely impatient till I am made acquainted with this most terrible affair , a thing Miſs Hamilton can not write me I am afraid is very , very , bad indeed especially when she know how very partial a Judge she would have of me which notwithstanding I should most certainly tell her very ſincerely my opinion . A bad , or a foolish thing , I can not suspect her off an imprudent thing the most ſenſible people are ſome times led into but they are always triffles or things of little consequence which may vex them for a day or two , but this affair by the way you treat it must be of more consequence I own I am afraid of a Love affair as I have always been of opinion that the more ſecure people are in their own minds abt these matters they are the eaſier taken in -- in short I must give up conjecturing & anſwering yrs- till I am better informed of the affair & shall see by the quickneſs of an Anſwer whither or no I am for the future to subscribe myself yr most affct Guardian Napier Lady Napier joins me in best wishes to Mrs- Hamilton who I am afraid is not made acquainted with terrible affair , However I must tell you I think you acted like yr- self in not ingaging to act Plays its not an employment for Young Lady 's of Honor & Character let it be never so fashionabl e & whatever is ſaid abt , it let me aſsure yo u it is looked upon by the ſenſible part of Gentlemen to be a qualification very unfit for the Miſstriſs of a family -- I am afraid my time of the News Papers on is about this time out or near it --
