June 27 th 1802 I was very sorry my dear Mrs Dickenson to hear from my Sister so indifferent an account of Mr D. Senr 's health but I sincerely with Louisa 's kind attention to him & her good nursing he will soon recover I am rejoiced to find that she continues well pray tell her with my affte love I should have expected to have heard from her but as her Grandpapa has been so ill I 'm sure her time has been too much taken up to think of writing letters -- I really should not have troubled you with this but as I know your goodneſs I am sure you will forgive what I am going to ask you to do It is to beg you will write to my Aunt Anna & entreat her not to let her abominable affairs make her so uneasy as she really is -- I can aſsure you my dear Mrs Dickenson that she is more Altered than you can poſsibly conceive & I am really fearful that if she does not take very great care of herself she will fall into a dreadful state -- I had hoped that being at seaside where they now are / would have quite restored her health & spirits but I do not now think she will be better in the least for it as she has taken I believe a great quantity of papers relating to the busineſs with her over which she will I know be inceſsantly pouring -- I have said as much as I could to her and so has my Aunt Barnard but all to no purpose indeed I am afraid she can not conquer the nervous state she has fallen into Mrs Watson the person with whom she boards tells me that my Aunt makes her quite melancholy the night before she went to Ramsgate she never went to Bed but was employed in counting over the boxes papers & c ( which were all packed up ) & which she meant to take with her , I can not will not now tell you of all these trifling circumstances but I am very certain that an indifferent person would say she was not in her senses If either you or Mr Dickenson would be kind enough to write to her upon this subject you it will be doing me a very great favor as I really have a strong affection for my Aunt & am very uneasy to see her in the state she now is in & tho ' I am well aware that her mind must be much distreſsed by the affairs I think if she wou ld make a resolution not to fatigue herself in ma kin g unneceſsary calculations & c I trust they wou 'd probably be sooner settled & her health would not suffer so much pray do not tell her you had this account of her from me as it may make her suppose she is worse than she really is , but I think any thing you or Mr D . will say to her she will attend to if you will enclose a letter for her to me at B le the Bishop 's I will forward it in a Frank to Ramsgate which will save the postage -- I am sure you would be happy to hear so good an account of My Sister & her little Girl she still continues quite well & is I hear a very good Nurse I long to see both her & the dear Baby -- but I am much afraid I shall have that happineſs till next year -- Mrs : H & the Bp spend the remaind er of this summer at Brighton & Hastings , when I shall go with them they do not mean to go to St Asaph till next summer they have very kindly said they hoped I should go with them but I shall I hope spend great part of the summer with my Sister -- we are only in Town for a few days in search of a house which I wish we could find as London is very unpleasant I do not know whether I do right in directing this to Birch Hall but as I have not heard that you were returned to Leighton House I conclude you must be there -- I understand Dr De Salis is still at hastings where I daresay we shall meet them -- Mrs Grote is there in a very bad state of health -- Pray give my kindest love to Mr D—— & Mrs Morrison & Believe me ever my dear Mrs Dickenson sincerely obligd & very affty yours M J Jackson remember me kindly to Mr & Miſs D—— & beg Louisa to write to me soon and send her letter enclosed to the Bishop London June Twenty Eighth 1802 Miss Dickenson Birch Hall Manchester Free Rochester
