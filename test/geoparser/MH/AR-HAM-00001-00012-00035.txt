Bourdeaux Novr . 19 th . 1781 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton To write a few Lines only in answer to so long , kind , & entertaining a Letter as that I recd from you at Madrid , I 'm afraid will make me appear but unworthy of it , & yet the hurry I write in to save the Post , could you but know it , would excuse me . In few words therefore be aſsured it gave me great pleasure in every Sense & that I feel very sincerely all your kindneſs & friendship , & value it as it deserves . Your Envelope contain 'd an Inestimable Treasure , in the dear Prince of Wales 's gracious remembrance of us all in his own handwriting , & I believe had not the distance between the Lines allow 'd of dividing the Paper , Harriet & I shd . have been at variance for the rest of our Lives about the Poſseſsion of it . pray with the Grateful Duties of Ld Winchilsea & myself tell his Royl Highneſs how happy he made us ; Harriet is to Speak for herself on the other Side of this Paper . I must just mention without entering into the Detail of our Journey that we had the good fortune to meet Mr & Mrs Graham at Madrid , & to continue our travels together all thrō Spain to Bayonne where we parted , they to go to Toulouſe for the Winter where Lord Winchilsea will join them , when we leave Bordeaux . Mrs Graham bore all her fatigues vastly well . Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton , thō I hope not for long , as you may expect to ſee me ſoon after you receive this , in ye mean while believe me Most Affly . & Sincerely Yours C Finch Bourdeaux Novr . 19 My dr Miſs Hamilton -- It seems very ungracious , to begin by saying , that I do not addreſs a Word to you , after having been so long , without seeing , or Speaking to you -- But I have no time , nor any Paper -- & yet can not receive such a Little Note , as I did on my Arrival at Madrid ; & not intreat you to say the P of W from me -- How much I th ought myself honor 'd by his Remembrance & that I was vastly flatter 'd by it -- I enter most heartily into ye Plan of Returning to dear England -- where I have too many Friends , & Amusements , & intreating Concerns , not to be most anxious to revisit & re enter into them -- I must however sing ye Praises of One of the 3 Countries I have Visited ( since I left my own ) As it is One , of Which I am More A E pris , than I ever was of any thing in my Life -- It is ye Charming little Kingdom of Portugal -- not only in itself Charming But its Natives are ye first People in ye World -- & talk ye most delightful Language poſsible -- They are likewise of a most beautiful Hue -- But not at all like ye Chev . Pinto -- If it was not for England , I know not how I should have resolved to have quitted that little Paradis terrestre -- Believe me my dr . Miſs H . I could say a great Deal to you -- but have really not a moment to do so -- & you know that may sometimes be really the Case , tho ' 't is often only an Excuse But in time I hope to tell you part , of my Memoirs when i ts n this Part of ye World , that may amuse You -- I hear a great deal of News from your World , & so many Marriages , that I do not believe I shall find one of my Friends left to amuse me -- Miſs Boughton 's with ye Bp of Durham I quite Rejoice in , as she will no longer be neceſsitated to pick up ye Crumbs from her Mother s Table -- But still I can not help being amused with the Idea of Made L'Ebegue -- I can not say that I envy Miſs Thynne my little Ugly Cousin -- Adieu I really could write on a Great deal more -- Altho ' you have never given me a Single Line , tho ' you promised me to do so when we parted : but once more adieu & believe me yr obliged & muita Sua Amiga Enriqueta To Miſs Hamilton S t James 's London Angleterre via Ostende
