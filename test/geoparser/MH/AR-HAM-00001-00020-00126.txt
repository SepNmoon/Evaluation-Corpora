Liverpool 16 th . July 1794 . My Dear Sister , I shall be very happy to see You & Yours here the first Week in August . I shall probably remain a fixture here till the beginning of October , when I wish to get home , for two important reasons . The first , to carry my Son to School , and the second , to watch the Kittens while the Old Cat is adding to the number . I fell in yesterday with a Company from Manchester , with whom , I had half a Mind to fall out . Furious Republicans . I hope , not enrolled in the number of your friends . A Mr . & Mrs- Phillips , a Mr . & Mrs- Rawlinson & a Mi≈øs Elis . White . Adieu , My Dear Sister , best affections to Mr. D . & Louisa . Ever Yours very faithfully and Sincerely Napier Ld .
