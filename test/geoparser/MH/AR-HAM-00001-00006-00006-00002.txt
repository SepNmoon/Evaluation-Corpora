The mornful and melancholy Ditty of the Dear Blackamoor 's metamorphosed wife Gave me infinite pleasure and delight ; and I am persuaded that he will have the same cause of complaints against You to the end of his life . Amen ! You want now to know why I did not answer Your charming letter sooner ? and I tell you because I did not receive it till just now , when I returned from Camden place ; from whence I was expected at home every moment , so no letter was sent after me . I have been in the North : Mr. Boyle 's illneſs put a stop to our exp e dition : The Gentleman inlisted himself in Lady Tyrconnel s Service where he was put upon so hard Duty that he fell into a violent fever , broke a Blood veſsel and all appearance of going into a consumption . When his mother was informed she began to be very much alarmed and sent to that abominable house , desiring him to come immediately to Thames Ditton ; which he consented to ; but all the while he was under the Doctor 's hands , that wretched woman Lady Tyrconnel came every day to the house belonging to Ly H : Vernon , next to Mrs. Walsingham 's Garden . Pray do not wish for many sons except You could be sure they that in time they would have all the bad quality your Blackamoor now poſseſses . Has More written to you and told You all how Mrs. Yearsley treated her and still does ? yes , with an unheard of ingratitude ; because Miſs More Secured the money for her Children ; and would prevent that wretch of squandering it away . I hope Miſs More will shut up her feelings and throw the writings of Trust at her head ; and have done with her . You invite me very kindly to come and see you in your sweet & happy Habitation ; and so I will take you by Storm the first moment I have it in My Power ; as there is no body in the world I shall be more pleased to see again then -- gueſs whom -- But I expect to find you converted into a Blackamoor likewise if you go on flirting on horseback in all weather with the Gentleman who does me the Honour of giving me for his Toast . Pray present my best Respects to him and tell him I long as much to see him as he does me . God bleſs you all ! and I am inclined I think pretty much to love you as long as I live and that you will alway find me to remain Your faithful M : Garrick Hampton Septr . the 30 : 1785 To Mrs : Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith by Derby Derbyshire Mrs. Garrick 1785 Sepbr-
