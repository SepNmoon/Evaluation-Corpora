I intreat of you my dearest Miſs Hamilton to be so kind , as to pardon me if I gave you an instants uneasineſs Last Night by asking you a question by his Majesty 's order I did it very innocently not knowing that there was any joke concealed under it . I was sorry to see that you was so not so chearful after it , as you usually are , and that you behaved rather coolly to me afterward s which gave me infinite pain . If you knew what pleasure it gives me to see you smile kindly upon me , I am sure you never would be so cruel as ever to fro lo ok grave upon me . I have a great deal more to say to you which I can not do now as we are going to ye Play , and whch . I must defer till Monday . Adieu my dearest Miſs Hamilton , and allow me to sign myself , Your George P . Friday 9 th . April 1779 P.S . -- Adieu once more my ever dear Girl . yr . G. P .
