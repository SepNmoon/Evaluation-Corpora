recd- Thursday Morng . ½ past 8 oClock 18 th . Novbr 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , my Friend , According to yr . desire I answer yrs . of M——y last , I think ye . precaution a very neceſsary one , & therefore shall not only comply with that , but with every thing else ( I hope ) my Miranda desires . I understand much to my joy , yt . this is not to be our last 's Day 's Chace this Season , but there is a report which strongly prevails , & wh : I g h ave great reason to give credit to , from what I heard my Father say about ye . hunting , yt . we shall all meet at W . at Christmaſs in order to paſs a fortnight or three Weeks of ye . Hollidays there . Ye . least reason I have for liking this idea is as you may suppose yt . I am afraid of seeing my Miranda there . Oh ! Heavens how inexpreſsible wld .. my joy be to meet my Miranda in a manner I cld .. wish , after ye . noise & racket of ye . busy Town . But what signifies tantalizing myſelf , however we will hope yt . such a time may come , let us always hope for ye . best I hope you continue to receive good accounts of M. G . she will I think be a great comfort to you in ye . Winter , especially as she lives so near to you , after you have been at some publick place or other , you may retire to her Apartment in order to have a ¼ of an hour 's Conversation with her , or she may come to yr . apartment . Ye . question my Miranda I mentioned to you in my last , & wh . I left you totally at liberty , about answering , is this , remember upon What grounds I mention it , to you having yr . promise fairly and honestly to answer me any question you can properly answer me concerning yrself . “ Whether “ or no , you ever had , or have , or think you “ shall have an d y ideas of entering into a “ rel clo ser connection or relationship with yr . “ other Brother , or whether he h ev er has entertained or do e s , “ or whether you think he ever will entertain such an idea. ” Pardon oh pardon my Miranda , ye . imprudence of such a question , consider how much I look upon myself as interested in it . Consider it is putting my mind at rest , & to a certain degree following ye grounds & original p al la n of our friendship for each other by putting both , not only yrself my but myself to ye test , for I aſsure you it costs me more to ask , than it does you to answer , but perhaps you will in yr . truly affectionate manner say , but why does it cost my friend so much to ask me a question yt . he says interests him is he afraid of me , am not I his real true , & best friend , do not I deserve his whole confidence , you have it my Miranda , by Heaven you have it , & it was princ i pally f n from this ground yt . my imprudence proceeded , if there is any i t n it , if there is , pray pardon it . It is just supper time so Ad . Ad . Ad my dst .. dst .. dst .. Sister Friend , Miranda , may Heaven bleſs you , & pr eser ve you , & believe when I say I am eternally yr . sincerely affectionate Friend & Brother Palemon toujours de même . P.S . I wiſh to know whatever you hear about me good , bad , or indifferent , I will certainly follow yr advice of marking something in my Letters , allusive to ye preceeding ones of yrs . encore une fois Dieu vous beniſse . V . P . toujours chére .
