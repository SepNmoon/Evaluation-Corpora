Grosvenor Square Decr . 5 th . 1800 My Dear Niece Beleive me my sincere affection towards you is ever the same , I did once receive a long letter from you before We were driven from Naples , but since that , I have never had a line from you , nor ever any mention of the Cavr . Palombo however I did not leave Palermo without having had from Genl . Acton the most solemn promise that Palombo shoud have immediately an Employment at Naples sufficient to give him & his family a competent Subsistance Subsistance -- We once got him from the generosity of the Queen of Naples a pecuniary aſsistance -- you may be sure that We will not abandon him & if his busineſs is not done already Emma who is in Constant correspondence with the Queen will engage Her majesty to induce Acton to fullfill his promise -- I have so much to say to you & so little time that let these few words suffice for the present , untill we have the happineſs of meeting -- I can not quit London untill my own confused affairs are Settled as yet I am ignorant of what is to to become of me , but certainly I do not wish to return ro Naples at least in a Public Character -- my Native air seems to agree with me but untill my mind is at rest I can not be quite well -- Emma s kind love has never faild towards you & yrs . & believe me you will even find us the same notwithstanding strange appearances of neglect on our Side -- for two years our Post was never sure & the loſs of Letters has been very distreſsfull to us -- with our best Compts . to Mr. D . & all your family I remain yr most sincere & affectionate uncle Wm : Hamilton
