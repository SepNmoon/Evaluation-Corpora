71 , Queen Street 25 th . Oct r - 1810 My Dear Sister , The death of Mr. Dickenson , though it could not surprise , at his Time of Life , yet the loſs of a Parent must be felt , happen when it will , and it is most natural that Louisa should be distreſsed at the Event . This occurrence may probably make some alteration in your Arrangements . I think , I have heard You say that , You never would live at Birch Hall ; but , perhaps , it may become your Summer Residence , at least , till You have fixed on a more agreeable situation . When I last wrote , I was setting out on a little Tour with my Daughters Anne & Sophia , during which , I carried them round a Circle of above two hundred & seventy Miles , through a beautiful Country , made more so by the richneſs of a most abundant harvest , and of p erformed in the finest weather , I ever remember to have seen . Not a drop of Rain , except one Evening after it was dark , when we were safely housed at Carlisle . We went first to Peebles , which is a neat Town on the Tweed . We then followed , or rather traced up the Banks of that beautiful River to its source ; then descended into the Vale of Moffat , where there is a small well built Town , resorted to by Invalids , for the sake of two medicinal Waters , of different qualities . Eight miles from Moffat , Lord Hopetoun has a fine Seat called Raehills , which he succeeded to , as heir to the late Marquis of Annandale . We spent three days there ; then proceeded to my Nephew Hunter 's at Barjarg on the Nith , then to Dumfries ; then to Annan ; then to Sir Amilius Irving s , Robgill Tower ; then through Gretna Green & Longtown to Carlisle ; back again to Robgill ; then to Langholm , where the Duke of Buccleuch has a very pretty place ; then to Hawick , where we explored every inch of our former Residence at Wilton Lodge , then to Mr Douglas 's at Cavers ; then , through Jedburgh to Mr. Rutherfurd 's at Edgerston , within three Miles of the Cheviot Hills ; then , down from the Mountains to Mr. Ogilvie 's at Chesters , on the Teviot ; then to Dryburgh Abbey ( Ruins ) on the Tweed ; then to Melrose Abbey ( Ruins on the Tweed ) then to Selkirk ; then , croſsed the Ettrick , reached the Tweed at Yair , mounted up the Banks of that River , till we again reached got to Peebles , and from thence we returned to Edinburgh . Now , if You have good Maps , & a little ingenuity , You may travel all this over , in leſs time than we took . The spirit of motion did not cease , on our reaching home , for in a very few days after , my two travelling Companions went to Lord Haddington s , at Tynninghame , in East Lothian , where they still remain . Being in a gracious mood , my Wife & I have paid a Visit to the Cathcarts , at Saltoun Hall , fourteen Miles from Edinburgh , where we permitted them to remain unmolested , for nearly three Years , nor did we then go , till his Lordship wrote expreſsly to fix a Time . The visit proved pleasant enough , as the Cathcarts laid aside their fiddle faddles . Since this , I have paid a visit to Mr. Dundas at Melville Castle , & tomorrow Rib & I , propose going to the Duke of Buccleuch 's at Dalkeith House . All these expeditions are performed , with Nightcaps . This days post has brought me a Letter from my Son William , at Lisbon , dated the 6 th . Instant . He is well on board the Kent . I had four first Cousins Napier 's , in the late action in Portugal , three of whom were wounded . Lady Sarah 's eldest Son Major Napier , severely ; her second Son Captain George , slightly ; her third Son Captain William escaped unhurt ; but Captain Charles Napier of the Navy ( my uncle Charles 's eldest Son ) who was there as a Volunteer , got a slight knock for his pains . Major Napier had arrived at Lisbon , when William wrote , and his wounds were doing well . By this time , there must have been another Battle , or Maſsena must have retreated . With my best Love to Mr. Dickenson Louisa & yourself , & best wishes to my Countrywoman I ever am , My Dear Sister Your Affecte- Brother Napier Edinburgh , Twenty Fifth October 1810 Mrs- Dickenson Mrs- Carill Worsley 's Derby Napier .
