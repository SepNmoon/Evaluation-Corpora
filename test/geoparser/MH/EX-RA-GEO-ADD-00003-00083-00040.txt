Mr : Preston is a Clergyman , has been abroad with two young Men of fashion , & the first time my Uncle William got leave to go to England -- he was left charge des Affaires at Naples -- he is singularly sensible & agreeable , gentle & polite in his manner , & notwithstanding his Person is but indifferent , & his face plain , there is something interesting wch . claims ones attention . You already knew my opinion of Dear Lady Dartrey -- as for him I do not believe there exists a more worthy benevolent being . -- from each I have experienced upon the most trying occasions every mark of the tenderest friendship -- Oh my friend what a bleſsing it is to have a strong sense of gratitude how otherwise could we repay ye . obligations we lay under but by expreſsions of that gratitude which to generous minds is sufficient recompence
