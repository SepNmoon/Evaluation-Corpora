My dear Miſs Hamilton , I have just heard from my Mother She Says she mends in respect to her Cough Appetite & Sleep -- But that she is rather deafer than she was when she left London -- she means however to have patience & Sr. N : Thomas wishes her to do so only & try ye Country Air l onger to give it a fair Chance . The Above my dr Miſs Ham : is what I trouble you with -- that You may hear how she is & likewise that you may be so good to repeat it at ye Queen 's House -- I wd . not say but to you -- what however does give me some further Comfort but wd- do no t good to repeat as it may seem more than it really is -- that by ye general Tenor of her Letter & manners of writing -- I shd- think she was in rather better Spirits -- Which makes me think she must be , thank God , vastly better ; that I can think so , when at ye same time , she says Expreſsly that her Ears & head are really worse -- & more inconvenient to her , -- & unfit her now for Society -- As I know she wd- be anxious to return to her Attendance I shd be wretch 'd any thing from Harleyford cd . imply her being able to do so sooner than she can -- Adieu I have writ nonsense but ever always ( tho ' in great haste ) yrs affy H F H. Finch S t James 's
