London 26 th . May 1783 Dear Sr . Upon my return this moment from the country without the leaſt expectation of any town-news worth attention , I was am put into the happieſt humour imaginable by you ; firſt ( you must allow me to say firſt ) that your dear and excellent lady is in a fair way of recovery ; next , that you are in such a manly state of health and reſolution , as to think of Buxton : and laſtly , that Miranda hath contributed her part with so much effect , who I am confident look 'd on her compliance as a moral obligation , independent of the pleaſure in such companions . In short , I should much wonder , if she gives you the trouble of stealing her away . To her I earneſtly recommend to keep you firm in your purpoſe , so long a progreſs by eaſy day 's journeys will in all events be salutary to all . Of the mineral , but of the bath in particular , I have thus much to say from experience , that they once cur 'd me of an inveterate rheumatiſm . I would adviſe you to appriſe the maſter of the hall at Buxton of your intention , that you may secure what appartments , rather lodging rooms , you may want ; for , indifferent as they are , an invalid will be put to some diſtreſs by lodging abroad ; it being a law , that thoſe without doors are not admitted to bathe , till all within are serv 'd : by which means , it often happens , that the former are kept back till noon , or later . Tell Miranda , I shall not forget her injunctions . With the united & cordial wiſhes of all he re to Lady Wake , yourself and helpful a ſ sociate I remain Dr . Sr . Your most affectionate & faithful servt . R Glover
