My Dear Miſs Hamilton I am much obliged to you for saying you would call here if I would let you know the time to find me ; . I have this day put on my Mourning , so that henceforward I begin my Attendance as usual at the Queens Houſe . therefore can only say any Morning ( after tomorrow ) that you can call before I go there ( which you know is a quar . before One , ) I shall be very glad to ſee you . What other time I have at home I now devote so entirely to Charles Fielding , that I deny myself the pleasure of receiving any of my Friends , till she shall be able to ſee ſome of hers . I am ever most Sincerely Yours . Mrs Feilding S t James 's . Sunday Night . 19 th . Jany . 1783 To CFinch
