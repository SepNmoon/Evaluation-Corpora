My dear Miſs Hamilton , I did Enquire about the rehearsal & told Mrs. Carter that we could not gain admittance gratis for half a guinea we might go -- but she declin 'd their proposal , as well as my self who am to be at two of the performances . I concluded she had told you this or I wd certainly have sent you word of it -- I am but just return 'd home or wd have sent an answer sooner yrs . Ever Affecly .
