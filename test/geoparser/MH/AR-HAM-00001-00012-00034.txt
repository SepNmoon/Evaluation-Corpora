Caldes . Aug . 15 th . 1781 . My dear Miſs Hamilton I have been every post day prevented from thanking you for your kind letter of May 2 9 th . since my return hither July 30 th . wch . was the first of my receiving it -- it is now such an old Story that I daresay you have almost forgot you wrote one , but I should feel myself very ungrateful not to thank you for it , & am determined though much hurried that this pen shall not go without my acknowledgements . as my time is short I am desirous resolved to begin on the subject which I most long just now to mention to you , your charming amiable Cousin Mrs. Graham -- Mr G 's friendly attentions & the infinite comfort we received from them in our fine distreſses here I have already mentioned to you , but now that I have been two Months without interruption with her also , I must tell you how fortunate I think myself in her acquaintance & friendship for I flatter myself I may claim both & it has been really a more thorough intimacy than I cd . have boasted of , if I had known her for years in London , & in all our mutual distreſses I suppose we were never half an hour out of each others sight -- I cd . not think more highly of him than I did before wch . makes me leſs copious just now on his subject , but I must say nothing could be more comfortable & happy & indeed merry when we all were together -- when I left her at Agromonte near Oporto the end of last Month their proceedings were quite unsettled -- she now writes me word that they have ( very judiciously I think tho ' I cd . not bear to advise it ) determined to give up all hopes thoughts of seeing England , & to spend the next Winter at Lisbon or in the South of France but I hope it will be the former as it agreed so well with her last year -- she was afraid that this determination wd . be a great disappointment to her friends in England , a mortification it certainly will be , but I have had the pleasure of sending her word this morning , that by a letter from Mrs. Hatton , I find that Ly Stormont in the middle of July , had expreſsed an idea that as she was not then returned , it might be better for her to stay till the ensuing spring , so this will prove to her that her friends will not be surprised at her now remaining here , & wd . approve very much of her not setting out for England in Augst . Mrs. H . also mentioned Ly S 's being perfectly well , wch . will be a great comfort to Mrs. G . as she had not heard of any of her friends since May . Miſs Cathcart is a charming little Girl but I must now send this Letter off directly -- we never recd that first Letter of M wch . you mention -- I 'm sorry we had such a loſs for I 'm sure it wd have been charming -- Yrs . sincerely S. F . we are all going on well Miſs Hamilton S t . James 's Palace London pr via Ostend
