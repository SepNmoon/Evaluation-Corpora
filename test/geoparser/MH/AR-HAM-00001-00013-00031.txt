4 Febry . 1786 Saturday the 4 th . Sunday the 5 th . is my dearest Miranda 's birthday , may you live to enjoy many many returns of that happy day is the ardent & sincere wish es of your mMary Glover , My dear Mother & Mrs. Lenton likewise join in their best wishes for a very very long continuance of your present good health & many years of uninterrupted happineſs to you & your Dickenson . I have been much hurried & hurt about bu ſ s ineſs of various kinds , the chief is respecting Dr. Warton My dr . A. M . was with me the Sunday morning when he call 'd , & during our conversation he said that he was much surprized that Ld . Palmerston should have heard that he was consulted about the publishing of my Father s manuscripts , & he seem 'd hurt that it should be known , he had desired me to get him some anecdotes about my Father , which I did , and applied to Dr. Brocklesby as he had known my dearest Father for upwards of Forty years , when I show 'd Dr. W . the paper he took it , & said very angrily , it is not english , & said he wish 'd Dr. B—— might not be consulted as they had had a difference some years ago & he did not by any means wish to to see him , before he took his leave he promised to go to Mr. Cadell the bookseller & talk to him about the works , he went away & I was very happy to think my Affairs were in such good train , on Monday my dr . A. M . wrote me a very long letter to tell me she thought that Dr. W . was displeased at me , & that she thought that he wish 'd not to write my Father s life , & that as his brother was poet Laureat & he had sons in the church that it might be of disadvantage to him & his family , as the King must have seen the paragraph in the papers wch . Dr. B . put into the papers two days after my dearest Father s death . -- & she concluded by saying that she thought it would be generous of me to release him from his promise , in short my dearest Mrs. D—— I breakfasted wth her on the Tuesday morning & we between us we wrote a letter to him , & in the letter I released him entirely from his promise of writing the life , & sent it to S : street , I heard nothing from him all Tuesday & Wednesday & I was compleatly miserable between hope & fear I desired my mother to write a note to him which she did & in it she said that I was quite unhappy least he should have mistaken any part of my letter & that she wished to see him very much , he return 'd for answer that he would call on her the next morning which was on the Thursday , Thursday & Friday came & no Dr. W : nor a single line , I was quite ill with anxiety , & he left Town on the Saturday without sending & I have not heard from him since he went to Winchester , I am very uneasy & I think if I had had you to have consulted with I should not have got into this scrape , Miſs A. C . talks of writing the latter end of this week to him & explain to him the reason of the letter being wrote , I think I shall be much happier when she has wrote , I have been quite ill upon it this account , but I am better . The other thing that has vex 'd me is about Richd . Glover My dr Father who had an estate in hand of about 600 a year & which after his death went to Mrs. Vernon , & after her to Rich 'd & in case he dies without Iſsue it was to come to me & my heirs for ever , Richd . has been asking counsels oppinion to set the codicil aside in short to deprive me of the entail , I am sure you will feel for me , It has hurt me a good deal , he never calls I suppose he he is ashamed to show his face , the Plate was left to my mother for life , she gave him an inventory of all she had in her poſseſsion , he wrote to Mr. Blacke our attorney , ( & he is my trustee ) to say that he had an inventory but that their were large & small waiters , but that indeed he did not know the sizes , & he wish 'd
