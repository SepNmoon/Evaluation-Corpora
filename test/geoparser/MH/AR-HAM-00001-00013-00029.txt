My Dear Miranda You have sent me a great charge to take care of ; & I am proud of the office ; & I think him a treasure of inestimable value . if he has a fault , it is being too humble in his own opinion ; I always lov 'd you , but now I admire you for the choice you have made ; true Virtue is real happiness ; who my Dear Child , what a great deal , have you to be thankful for ; I dont mean to remind you of your Duty to God , I know you are bleſs 'd with a most greatful heart , & worthy of such a husband ; & I must say , I think him worthy of You . -- what a happy Man must his Father be , to have such a Son ; & at the close of life , to have the addition of my Dear Miranda . I dont mean to complain ; I have been bleſs 'd with one of the best of husbands : but those Days are over , Dear Creature , I never have him out of my thoughts ; but when I reflect , that he his gone to reap the benefit , of his great & good actions ; I feel happy at the thought . I thank God he has left behind him one good Child ; that will always be a comfort to me ; I wont enter any further upon the subject ; your good Dickinson will tell you all . my best Compliments to Lady Wake , & remember me to the rest of the family as you see proper . --
