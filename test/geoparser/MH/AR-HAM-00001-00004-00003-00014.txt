July the 4 th : 1790 . Stanton . Bury St : Edmund 's Suffolk . Dear Mrs : Dickenson , I am in a new Habitation , as you will perceive by the Top of this Letter . I have been here near a Fortnight , and am very well pleased with our little Place : it is pleasant either for walking or riding , and the House is very comfortable . We proposing propose staying here till November . We have not yet seen all our Neighbours , for the Election has much engaged most of them , hitherto . That Busineſs is terminated now , however . Sir John Rous and Sir Chas : Bunbury , carried the Election by a great Majority , against Sir Gerard Vanneck . My Father went to Ipswich to vote for Sir Charles Bunbury . I hope you , Mr : Dickenson , and the dear little Girl , have been perfectly well , since I last heard from you . I long to see my pretty little Cousin , who I dare say , improves daily . My Brother is with his Regiment ( the 10 th : Dragoons -- ) at Croydon . The Fatigue of military Duty disagreed with him a little , at first ; but he is now , quite well , and I hope and believe , will find no more Inconvenience from it . My Sister and her Children , were well when I last heard of them . My Father and Mother are quite pleased with this Place ; which I am very glad of , as that makes some Amends to my Father , for his disadvantageous Exchange . I dined in Company with Mrs : Siddons , a few Days before I came here . She has been in a most perilous State , but is vastly better ; and Sir Lucas Pepys says she will soon be quite well . Mr : Kemble is now , Proprietor of the Theatre at Liverpool ; so , Summer brings no Rest to him : however , he goes through all his Occupations very succeſsfully . The Operas are not yet over in London . The Number subscribed for , is out , but Gallini has a few Nights exclusive of the Subscription , because that is clear Gain . He really ought to make something , for I think this last Season can not have been profitable to him , considering the smallneſs of the Theatre , and the great Price he gave Marchesi I fear we shall not have Marchesi next is engaged at Venice . Sir William Hamilton is to be in England in the Spring : I am very glad of it , for I wish much , to renew my Acquaintance with him . Have I any chance of seeing you in London , in the Course of the Season ? I hope I need not say how happy it wou 'd make me . My Father and Mother beg to be affectionately remember 'd to you and Mr : Dickenson , to whom I beg you will likewise present my best Regards ; and I remain , my dear Cousin , sincerely & affectionately yours . J : Hamilton . Mrs : Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
