Welwyn , Herts , 24 th : Feby- 1781 . Ten Thousand thanks to my Dearest Sister for her very kind Offer -- She must not be hurt if I decline taking advantage of her generosity , neither would I wish that She should impute my refusal to Pride or false delicacy -- You bid me not answer 'till I have reflected , & I have obeyed You . The more I reflect the more improper , not to call it dishonest would be my acceptance of the astonishing proof you give me of your friendship and esteem , appear to the world and to myself . No my Dear Sister , I sincerely trust that no selfish consideration will ever induce me to act contrary to my own Idea of Integrity , and while I feel myself actuated by principle & equity , I never can prevail upon myself to borrow without a certainty of being able to repay -- In your debt I must for ever be , and I am convinced you will do me the justice to beleive that I feel the full force of your disinterested and generous proposal -- I hope you will ever find my friendship for You real & sincere . It distreſses me beyond expreſsion to find you put the tryal of its sincerity upon my acceptance of what would make me despise myself for ever , should I even entertain the most distant intention of doing so -- at the same time I shall always conceive my obligation to You the same as if I had accepted . My heart is too full to add anything more to what I have wrote , or to correct its incoherency , I can only say that I am & ever will be your most sincere friend & much obliged Brother -- N—— This block must be turned over Sepr 1783 to Feb 1781 1781 to 1818
