20 Febry 1790 Old Burlington St- Saturday I waited till the post arrived with yr- much wished for Letter -- I then dispatched mine to you & set off to Chelsea -- there I could not stay more than ten minutes , to give directions to the Carpenter about Packing Boxes & c -- & returned to town to dreſs for dinner -- at 4 I went to yr- Uncle 's -- Pachierotti came in soon after me & dined there -- the Afternoon paſsed as usual -- at 8 Ld . Warwick -- the Bishop of Kilmore & Mrs. Jones , ye Bishopeſs -- Mr . & Mrs. Piozzi and Mr. Pemberton came -- Pi & Miss H—— sang a Duet & Piozzi joined them in a terzato wch . far exceeded any thing I have heard before -- At 11 we separated I desired Ld W—— to set me down at his door and he good naturedly brought me home -- Sunday -- This morning by appointmt- I met Mr. Kershaw my Coach Acquaintance at Old Slaughter 's Coffee House where we breakfasted at 9 -- then walked forth -- & called first at Mr. Hern 's who 's paintings we did not see as he was in bed we called at Mr. Craig 's we obligingly shewed us his drawings -- this young Man has discovered this method , of keeping water colors wet for 2 or 3 days , so that they have the advantage of Oil -- next we called on Mr. Farrington who 's manner of Drawing is in a very different stile -- he very obligingly opened all his Port Folio 's , & attended us to Mr. Webber 's , another Artist , who accompanied Capt . Cook -- here we saw another manner of drawing -- after examining his portfolios we all -- went to Mr. Sandby 's where we staid an hour -- then we spent a little time at old Serres 's looking over some of Vandervelt 's schetches & his own paintings -- afterwards we separated to dreſs for dinner -- I met Mr. Kershaw Mr. Farrington Mr. Webber & Mr. Herne at Slaughter 's Coffee House where we dined -- soon after 7 I left them & went to A Maria 's where I found Cr Palombi -- at 8 he & I went to Sir Rt H—— I introduced him to Sir Robt . & Ly H who was properly attentive to him -- I desired Mrs. Carter wd . give me leave to introduce ye- Cr . to her -- Mr. Walpole who sat next to her -- exclaimed “ for God 's sake dont introduce him to me for I 'm sick of Foreigners ” -- wch . cooled me affectually -- so I let poor Palombi remain unpresented -- that Coxcomical puppy Pindemonte was there & affected to treat Palombi with the “ Haut ten bas ” I fancy the fellow perceived that I did not like him , for he wd . not look at me -- his sagacity was sufft to find out that -- thō it did not prompt him to leave a room when he found himself an intruder -- indeed I dont wonder at people 's dread of foreigners -- for they stick to you like Bird Lime -- there is no poſsibility of shaking them off & they are much complained of -- at 9 Cr P . set me down Monday -- This morning I paid Owen 's bill for the B water -- walked to the bottom of Fleet Street to buy some useful articles of Household Luxuries to please my own self -- went up to Eagle Stt Holborn about my picture frame -- from there we walked back thrō Lincoln 's Inn -- called at Ld . Mansfield s , who is at Caenwood came to Mrs Jackson s & from there to Chelsea -- I saw most of my things put into Cases -- left the others in train & walked to town at ½ past 4 , dreſsed & took a Coach to Portland place at 5 -- I shd . tell you that Ld . S . called on me yesterday when I was out -- Ly . S . sent out her fine little Girl to me -- but unfortunately ye- Damsel was sleepy -- a little before 6 when I had nearly read this Pamphlet agt . ye- Test Act Mrs- Graham & Miſs Cathcart came -- We sat down to dinner yet Ld . S did not come from ye- House of Lords -- at 6 -- soon afterwards he came -- he told me that he had reserved a ticket for Hastings 's trial for me if I chose to go -- it was a very polite attention before I came away he told me if I prolonged my stay he hoped to see me again & ran after me to ye stairs to desire his beſ love to you -- Ld . S 's civilities to me are particularly flattering I am sure it owing to his attachment to you -- it must be so for I can not entertain or amuse him -- or be useful to him -- at 8 I came away -- when I got to Cavendish Square it began to rain & before I cd . get to a stand of Coaches my sweet person was wet to the Skin -- so I trugged on to Burlington St . as fast as I cd . & changed my dreſs -- Tuesday -- at 8 I went to AMaria 's to tell her that it was impoſsible for me to fulfil my engagement of meeting Palombi at her house to breakfast this morng as the Cart was to bring the things from Chelsea at 9 & they men must be attended to , as I cd . not leave 3 or 4 men to themselves in Mr J 's house -- we arrived at ye- Bell in Wood St . before one with our Goods & Chattels -- Wm . Ben met me there -- it was past 3 before I cd . prevail upon the people to weigh ye Goods whch they evaded by one excuse or other , the reason for it I know was to charge me 4 or 500 lb wt . more than there really was -- as it is youll think there is quite sufft- & I hope they will come safe -- I shall -- receive great pleasure from seeing you occupied in arranging your shells , foſsils & c & the eagerneſs of our dear Child 's perplexing aid in decomposing yr- management -- Dear little Soul , How I love her -- not entirely for herself -- but because she is the Daughter of my dear Mary -- indeed my Love the only merit I will allow my self to poſseſs is that of having discernment enough to be sensible of yr- very superior worth -- & in loving you infinitely more than every earthly consideration -- I returned to Mr. Jackson 's at 4 and dined with him -- he is gone out for an hour or two -- which I am employing in scribbling to you -- It is not improbable but I may have the happineſs of seeing you before you receive this -- In case that should not happen -- & that I may be prevented from leaving Town -- before as soon as I propose to do -- I must inform you that the Goods will arrive at Horridge I believe on Wednesday next -- when a Cart must be sent to meet ye- waggon -- & in a small box no . 13 you will find the Keys of most of the Drawers -- Wednesday -- at ten I went to Ld . Warwick 's -- he & all yr- family have had the bad cold that every body complains of -- I did not see Lady W—— who has seen nobody for a fortnight I believe her principal complaint is owing to a young Impertinent -- I saw the Children -- & without exception must say , that they are the finest family I ever saw -- all equally docile good tempered & affecte -- Ld . W—— was very pleasant & very friendly -- I staid with him till past 12 -- I left my name at Ly . Herries -- then called on Mr. G. Foote with whom I paſsed an agreeable hour -- he informed that a certain person had highly offended a great many people a few days ago , by keeping them waiting for 2 hours before he made his appearance to those who came to pay their respects to t him there was a general grumble & a general squeeze -- many talked of returning , supposing that a mistake had been made in the day & c -- all were dissatisfied -- there were a great many confined in a room together -- wch . made some seriously ill -- I left my name for Sir Robt . Gunning & for Ly F. Harpur was let in at Mr. Walpole s -- I found him distreſsed by a country parson , who was consulting him about a manuscript which lay before him -- Mr. W—— s advice wd . soon have driven me away -- but he persevered & sat me out -- Mr. W—— said many kind things for you & sent you some publication wch . I have in my pocket -- but have not yet seen even the title page as you may judge presently -- I paid my compts . to the Bloſsets , who appear very well -- then left my name for Mrs. Carter -- Mr.- Mrs.- & Miſs Iremonger s -- at Miſs Bowdler 's I found Mr. Sackville -- where I found the Acct . confirmed of the complaint agt . a certain person Ly Herries came in -- she said she had ten thousand things to say to you but her eyes were not well enough -- her general state of health is certainly better than for many years -- & she looks very pretty -- I intended to have dined wth- them today , but I found AM—— wd . not be pleased if I did not dine once wth- her , & this is the day she fixed on -- at Ly Cremorne 's I left my name -- was let in at Mrs. Boscawen s where I found Ly Bute , Ly Camelford , & Mrs. Lewisham -- Mrs. Boscawen said many civil things -- I left my name for Mrs. Digby who lives at the next door -- also for Ly Beaumont -- for Cr Palombi -- & 3 at Mr. Hamilton 's -- at Mrs. Montagu 's gate , I met Mrs. Boscawen -- where we left our names -- then I went to Wimpole St . saw Mrs. Christie & one of the Miſs Longhams -- left my name for the Capt . -- then called at the Dſs . of Atholl 's in Hanover Square , for whom I left my name -- was admitted at Mrs. Glover s , where I staid a ¼ of an hour -- and am now writing to you from AMaria s -- she is very well -- & desires her Love -- poor Soul ( -- she dare not leave her charge , whh is a serious trouble to her -- I am very well , I aſsure you -- & shall now have the Happineſs of returning to my Mary 's arms very soon I will not tell you when I mean to set out -- not by way of surprising you -- but not to awaken yr- affectionate solicitude for my safety from the perils of a stage Coach Adieu best of Wifes -- & most amiable of women You are & for ever will be most tenderly beloved by your own JD Dear Louisa -- God bleſs her -- London February twenty fourth 1790 Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire Warwick
