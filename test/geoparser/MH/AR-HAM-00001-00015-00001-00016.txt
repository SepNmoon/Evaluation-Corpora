St James 's November 2 d If you were not grown the very worst of Correspondants from being the best , my dear Friend ; I should be alarmed at your frequent and long Silences -- but by experience I know that they do not imply ill Health , and still leſs oubli or indifference , to one you have long loved , and who loves you much , and sincerely -- It is therefore determined that I must neither be uneasy , nor angry -- the latter I am sure I never could nor can be with those Friends I have tried , & am sure of -- it seems to me & al l ways has done so , the most unatural & unworthy mark of Friendships , to expreſs doubts , suspicion , mistrust & anger ! yet some People hold these affections to be inseparable from true regard ! I shall only say that when you can and do write , I shall be sincerely happy and rejoiced to hear from you -- You have received no doubt my letter from Farmborough , which tho ' not on a folio sheet , was filled & promised you another soon -- this was written around the 26 th of September , & properly directed -- I went from thence to St Leonards for a Week , where as I always do , I spent my time in the Manner mos t agreeable to myself -- the Place I doat upon -- the Inhabi t ants I love -- the Visitors are pleasant -- I but the Charm of the place is that I am considered as a tame Cat & allowed , to rise , walk , go to bed , when I please -- & am never questioned or inquired for , whatever I do or wherever I go , but allowed to rove for hours in the Forest by myself , and indulge my own thoughts without molestation -- I came to Town for the Drawingr oom with Gen : & Mrs Harcourt -- she received that Day an account of Miſs Danby 's Death -- this Event had been so long & constantly expected , and from Miſs Danby 's sufferings , was become so desirable , that the account of it was a relief , instead of shock to Mrs Harcourt -- I went to Horton after the Drawingroom and had the mortification to find my dear Sister in a very uncomfortable state of Health , nearly in the same way that she has been for these two last Autumns . she has entirely lost her appetite -- literally so -- for she could not bear a bit of bread or a drop of Broth with out great pain -- yet Dr Kerr says there is nothing doing in her case , & has not even ordered her any Medicine , but a great deal of exercise , warm cloathing and change of air -- my anxiety , which notwithstanding Dr Kerr s aſsurances , was very great , prevented me from writi n g to you my dear Friend , or attending to anythi n g during my Stay at Horton -- we left it together on the 18 th of October -- stayed two or three Days in London & then went to Richmond Park , where we had some delightful weather , of which we profited most comple tely my Sister rode , I walked 3 or 4 Miles every day & was much the better for it , tho ' I can hardly be better than in perfect Health , a bleſsing I can boast of at this minute , and for which I am very thankfu l I left the Park last Thursday for Farmborough , where I promised to return , to celebrate Mr and Mrs Wilmot s Wedding Day , on which we had a very pleasant dance -- I went from thence to Ld Lothian 's -- to see the Ly Kerrs who are charming Girls -- I had the delight of bei n g in the House with Mrs Bates & of enjoying her singing in so comfortable a way from mor n i n g to night , without the constraint of a London Concert , where you are fixed on one chair for 4 hours together in a hot room . I came to Town Monday , havi n g some little busine ſs here before the Drawingroom -- I have been room ever since without moving even to Din ner and have found occupation enough , from 8 to 11 without any society -- I believe the ir re are People in Town , but I have not enquired , & should be sorry to have been interrupted -- Pſs Emily has left Lord Pelham and Besborough Executors -- 4000 £ a piece to the two Ly Waldegraves -- other Legacies , but the Bulk of her fortune to the Prince of Heſse -- I go to morrow to Richmond , & next week to St Leond with BEIG -- she & my Father go to Bath at the end of this Month -- adieu my dear Friend -- Car a mi a write soon -- God bleſs you -- remember me kindly to Mr D -- God bleſs you -- CMG -- To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire Honble Miſs Gunning Octer . 1786
