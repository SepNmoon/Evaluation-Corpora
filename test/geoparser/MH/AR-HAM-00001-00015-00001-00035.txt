S t . James 's March 17 th 1789 Well my dear Friend , I am at length sitting down to write to you -- il en est temps indeed -- I have been lately in a continual hurly Burly a tourbillon not of engagements or amusements I aſsure you nothing leſs -- I believe the joy I have felt on Miſs Gunning 's recovery , & from the many concomitant circum stances of that happy Event , has almost turned my head at least it has confused it most extremely -- I am beginni n g now to come to my senses again and to think of Mrs Digby well & his Government firm and established as circumstances that have always existed , & I only remember the dreadful three or 4 Months that are over as a horrid dream from which thank God I have awakened , I trust for ever -- Indeed my dear I could not bear to write , nay to think even duri n g that period -- I could have wished to have slept & been insensible to all that was goi n g on about me -- it was miserable to exist at that time , alone ones reflections were dismal & heart breaki n g , in Society , one was sure of meeti n g some unfeeli n g Enemies whose indecent & inhuman language , was irritati n g & oppreſsiv e to the last degree -- now they are scarce silenc ed & profeſs to disbelieve the King 's recovery , or to doubt the continuance of his health -- the fact tho ' is , & thank God it is so -- that he never was better in his life , or more equal to busineſs as a proof of the strength of his mind & nerves he has heard I believe every circumstance of the King s conduct , without that knowledge havi n g occasioned any thing like a relapse which his most sanguine Friends always dreaded if you were here by my fire side which I heartily wish you were , & hope you will be soon , I could tell you a thousand anecdotes relative to this dear & good the King whose heart , magnanimity , & true amiable good & great character was never so well known before -- Oh ! the thousand instances of generosity of that true spirit of Christianity which forgiv es injuries & frames excuses for the faults even of our Enemies , that have come lately to my knowledge -- at some future period I hope to reenjoy the pleasure it gives me to think over them by communicati n g them to you -- the Duke of York is now at Windsor , since Saturday , tht he called going home -- he returns to Kew on Wednesday , King you know comes to the Draw : on Thursday to receive I imagine the universe -- it is inconceivable what the croud will be -- in the Eve n i n g we give a Ball on this happy occasion -- a small one it must be on account of our house but it will equally testify our joy & satisfactio n it has given new life & spirits to my Father -- he saw the K . a week ago at Kew & found him everythi n g he could wish -- we have here a second winter -- hard frost , deep snow indeed yesterday & to day it has changed to rain but it is still very cold & miserable & I am not I have had a cough & cold these 3 weeks , the effe ct of wrappi n g up as I have done this winter , I never used to catch cold when I wore nothi n g , now if a breath of air touches me I am ill -- the French Embaſsador has begun to open his House on the Ki n g 's recovery -- I have been at two suppers there & he is goi n g to give a Ball , I was at a very loyal & pleasant one at the Queen s on Friday given on this occasion -- they are now beginni n g -- I intend goi n g out of Town as soon as ours are over ( for we are to have two one on the Monday after the first ) to Richmond to enjoy a little comfort and quiet -- I hope by that time the weather will be more settled , in all this joy I sometimes forget the many sources of misery or at least disquiet , I suffe r from in my heart -- one of the most serio us is perhaps my Brother 's state of health which is so indifferent that I never look at him without friſsone ing & he will not consult the King -- there is the obstinacy of Men -- there is no prevaili n g on them to do what is right if they have even a fancy to object to it -- he has no cough , but a slow fever & looks the picture of death -- my Father & Ly Sidney are God be than ked well . Turton is still wth us & will I believe continue about a fortnight longer she is better , has had no return of her Cough but I think has very bad health -- all desird to be kindly remembered to you & Bell not forgetti n g dear little Miſs Robinson -- if you ask me what I have done in the readi n g way I could say little more than the newspaper the Pamph let of the day & the subject , & except a great deal of German which I have been deeply engaged in -- I have seen Mr Dickenson twice -- she stays at home on Louisa s account who hurt her Leg & has been laid on a couch for these two Months past -- she inquired much after you -- and was very civil and gracious to me , but we are not coming on or ever shall again -- all I wish is to be on terms of civility wth people of her character & disposition -- God bleſs you my dear Friend -- remember me -- I must say somethi n g of Mrs Walsingham to you & f his best Compts to you when I wrote -- he is better in health tho looki n g ill -- still fixed at Kew & Windsor so that his Friends have literally seen nothi n g of him this winter but for mere moments -- he is acti n g a great & important part -- & has the satisfaction & reward of knowing himself to be useful to his country as well as to those whose virtues & friendships & kindneſs attach him to them -- Whites club are goi n g to gve a magnificent Ball on the 27 th on the Ki n g 's recovery at the Pantheon -- all Friends are to be in a white & gold uniform wth God save the Ki n g in their head , as well as heart -- I will write you an account of it after our Balls & hurry is are over Miſs Boyle Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
