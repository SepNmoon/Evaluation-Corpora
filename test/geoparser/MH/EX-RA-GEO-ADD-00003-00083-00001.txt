I accept your friendship & hope I never shall forfeit your esteem -- in return , I offer you I can without injuring my honor accept Your friendship -- to listen to more I should justly forfeit the e steem you say yo . have for me -- you never shall re pent the confidence s you have placed in me -- & it will be you r fault if our friendship is not permanent as our lives -- for that I offer you is pure sacred & totally disinter ested -- such a one that time , separation , or difference of situation never can will not alter -- I shall believe me , be always interested in your welfare -- one thing more & I have done , do not offend my delicacy any more again by sending me presents -- I acknowledge I have a little pride of heart therefore lay me under no further obligations of that kind -- the one you gave me some time ago was a pleasing mark of friendship therefore I scrupled not to accept it -- the rest were superfluous & I shall return them no more Adieu you will ever have my warmest wishes my Prayers for your happineſs If you chance to forget me in Bustle of the world , I shall regret we ever form 'd a friendship -- but I will not complain -- I tremble for you -- You will be surrounded by servile servile flatterers -- You will have a thousand attachments -- no one seldom will tell you hear the truth -- & remember one thing & friends are not to be bought -- may your fate be happier than the generallity of people persons in your exalted situation -- Your heart I believe is excellent -- follow its dictates & you will be leſs liable to err than if you suffer yourself t led away by a thousand number of interested wretche s that will surround you -- Adieu -- You see I take the liberty of a friend -- I drop your titles & c & c -- Sunday Morng . 30 th .
