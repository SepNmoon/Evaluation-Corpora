My dear Miſs Hamilton When I recd . yr . kind Letter at Falmouth we were just going to embark & when I last wrote from hence I had no spirits to thank you for it , I am now a little more happy about both my Mother & my Brother & therefore I seize this opportunity to tell you how sensibly I feel your kind participation in our bitter distreſs my Mother 's spirits are exceedingly low but in her health she is certainly mending & I hope whenever my Brother 's recovery makes a quicker progreſs than it does at present her cheerfulneſs will return -- if lovely views & bright sunshine cd . give them she wd . have spirits now for we live in the midst of both in an elevated pleasant situation just out of the town & over look a great part of it & of all the shipping in the Tagus -- I think we shall rather be losers in this respect by removing 50 Miles up the Country to the Caldas Baths wch . can not be so beautifully situated as I hear they hardly admit any view of the Sea & are in a flat Country which is very opposite to our situation here where one can not make a common visit in the town without going up & down some of the many hills on wch . it is built . Mr . & Mrs. Graham are all goodneſs to us & I hope to be so far easy about our two dear Invalids as to trouble to return with them to England in June -- adieu my dr . Miſs Hamilton I have been writing the whole E . & my hand & Eyes wd . fail me for saying more than this I am very sincerely & affly . Yrs . S. Feilding My Mother & Sister desire their kind love & compts . Buenos Ayres April 28 . 1781
