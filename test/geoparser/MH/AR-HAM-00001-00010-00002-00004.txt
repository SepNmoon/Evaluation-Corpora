Wimbledon 29 th June 1790 . Dear Madam , I can aſsure you that I embrace the earliest opportunity of thanking you for the kind Letter you sent me last week , which I received at Newark . I was at that time with a broken heart ( tho ' thank God I am since something better ) in the middle of a contested Election , & in the most imment imminent danger of my life from the Riot ; however all this I escaped and carried the two Members for the Duke notwithstandg every species of bribery practised by our Opponents with very high numbers . I was most ably aſsisted by Mr. Garrow as Counsel whom I took from four . The loſs of my lovely Boy is a stroke & a shock , I shall long feel -- Fanny has had a very narrow escape , but thank God is said to be out of all danger . I am obliged to you for your intended kindneſs to Kath : & Mary , but previous to my leaving London I had sent them to Eton , where I hear they are w i e ll & will remain the Holidays . Frances Barnard is very ill with the Gout at Bath , & I am , un likely to paſs much time at this place with the Duke . I had before let my House at Richmond to Moreau for the Summer , intending to go to the Sea with my Children -- I intend for the present taking a Lodging for Mrs. Vaughan near Town 'till she is fit to go to the Sea . It will I am sure give you great pleasure that Services rendered Fanny has induced him to signify that I shall be handsomely provided for -- His Grace joins most heartily in my succeſs ; -- But with all these prospects a gloom at times siezes my mind still and which I am afraid for a long time , will be afflicted for the loſs of my poor Dear boy .. I hope Mr. P—— and Mr. Dickinson are well I am Dear Madam , Your faithful & obed ſert Louisa . John Jackſon at Taxal Chapel le Frith Cheshire 21 2-2 23 2 10-6 23 12-6
