My Dear Miſs Hamilton As I can not hope to ſee you now before I leave London , I can not refrain from expreſsing to you upon Paper , how truly & tenderly I feel for you , & hope you do make use of every Argument of Comfort that your Situation allows of ; & that Providence will aſsist your Endeavours of resigning yourself to his Will . You can not imagine how much & kindly you are mention 'd by every body at the Queen 's Houſe , & their Majesties have both been particular in their Enquiries about you ; & expreſsing their Concern for you . The Queen order 'd me to say she hoped you would take all poſsible Care of yourself , & let no Thought of yr Attendance here be any Disturbance to you , for she wish 'd you to take your own time , & do every thing that can most contribute to your Ease of Mind , on so trying an Occasion . I hope my Dear I shall find you at my return calm & composed , & willing thankfully to enjoy that portion of happineſs & Comfort that a kind Providence allots to all those that hurt in his Goodneſs , who alone knows what is best & fittest for us . I am happy to think you have so tender & Sensible a Friend as Miſs Clarke with you , & beg you will thank her for her last Letter to me . All I can say kind & feeling on this Subject , my Daurs . sincerely join in , & I hope my dearest Miſs Hamilton will believe that I shall ever be happy to approve myself to you a most Affcte . Friend & faithful Sert . CFinch St James 's Sunday Night 29 th . Novbr .. 1778 recd . on the Death of My beloved Mother . Typed On her Mother 's Death to Mary Lady C. Finch To Miſs Hamilton
