Babel -- 1781 -- 8 th August 1781 This is the 8 th . of August & Your two dear letters of July 23 d . & 28 th remain unanswer 'd -- I have very good reasons to give for my silence -- the Illneſs of Elise , wch . obliges me to be in constant attendance -- Journeys to Leuctra , & Accapulco -- thinking feeling quite exhausted wth- wth- fatigue at night ( otherwise I might sometimes write a few lines before I go to bed -- but then ye . busineſs of ye .. day does not close till past 11 -- & begins at 6 , I can never get to bed before 12 for I sleep in Atoſsa s room & c & c. ) I waited likewise as I wanted to find out for You , where Mercury 's day was to be kept ; & after every enquiry I can only inform You that it is thought it will not be kept , as he is absent -- but that there will be a Synod held , wch . will of course be a very full one , as all the People invited to the Fête on P. W . 's day will be there ; -- I am sorry to tell you that ye . conduct of Helen & her daughter is become the common topic of conversation ; I really have not time to enter into particulars , but I must say that I greatly rejoice you were at a distance & not of their parties to Babel -- they have not miſs 'd one afternoon coming over -- Helen is highly blam 'd , & though I do not mean to be the judge of her actions , I can not help thinking her both imprudent & weak . The Germans are gone out of England w h ether she deserves it or no , I know not , but her character is ruined -- in this family her name has never been mention 'd since their abrupt departure . Ah ! my Astrea Friend what profit & instruction one gains , if one has any turn for reflection , by living in such a school as this -- & what comfort to poſseſs a clear conscience I do not presumptuously however imagine that I am more perfect than others & therefore leſs liable to err -- I am but too sensible of the weakneſs & imperfection of human Nature , but I constantly implore the protection of our almighty Father , ( & to those who call upon him ) friend & protector , to guard my erring Soul . do you remember some sweet lines in Mrs. Carter s Poems ? “ If by the days illusive Scenes misled , “ My Erring Soul from Virtues path has stray 'd : “ If by example snar 'd , by Paſsion warm 'd , “ Some false delight my Giddy sense has charm 'd “ My calmer thoughts the wretched choice reprove , “ And my best hopes are center 'd in thy love . “ Deprived of this , can life one joy afford ? ! “ It 's utmost boast , a vain unmeaning word , ” -- “ All powerful Grace , exert thy gentle sway , “ And teach my rebel Paſsions to obey , “ Lest lurking folly wth . insidious Art “ Regain my volatile inconstant Heart . & c : Sections from A Night Piece ( also known as Thoughts at Midnight ) , by Elizabeth Carter ( 16 December 1717 – 19 February 1806 ) . How are You my Dear friend in Health ? I was greatly concern 'd to find your old complaint was return 'd , & from the stile of your last letter I have my apprehensions that you secretly cherish a recollections that depreſs yor . Spirits . to what else can I impute the melancholy that hangs over You -- surrounded as you are at present with every thing one that is dear to you except Your Miranda , & though she has not the comfort of being with You , or near You , aſsured of her affection & the sincerity of her friendship -- open you heart to me , ease my anxiety -- or let me share your sorrows . Hero is not yet come -- I have had another meſsage from her -- a verbal enquiry -- the windows of her apartments are open , & I think they appear to be making preparations for her coming . I will not fail to take the earliest opportunity of seeing her when she does , & of saying every thing proper for you . Louise has sent You Klopstock from Hanover , ye . German General is return 'd & told me this Morng . he had brought it for you . Adieu my Drst . friend -- I write in haste -- give my best Compts . to B & Is . I enclose the list of those invited to Orion s Fête . Perfecta has written me two letters -- her Son s health gains ground but slowly -- her married daughter -- & my Cousins were taken prisoners in their return to England & are at present in Spain . Adieu .
