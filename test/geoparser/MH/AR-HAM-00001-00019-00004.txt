Boston Decr : 20 th 1768 I am very Sorry for the Cause of my Dear Miſs Hamilton s Sillence -- we heartily wish yr Pappa & Mamma the entire Recovery of their Healths with every thing that can make Liffe agreeable to You & them . Accept & offer them from us all our best Wishes for many Happy returns of the Saison : as its generaly a Merry makeing time I hope you 'll be all able to enjoy it as Such . As to us we are at present Well indeed we have had our Share of Sickneſs as well as you since we parted -- as to me I 'm so Unweildy I shall not be sorry when the time comes that is to confine me altogether I might now return Mrs Betty Isted s Card with great truth were I to return to Northampton -- & Say I am too big to go Visitting -- however like her I still contrive to crawll about amongst my friends people here are much leſs Babylonians than with you they are an Honest kind good Sort of People -- live well & are very ready to give their friends a part of their good things No Election disputes & but litle party of any kind amongst people of any fashion though the Division of the Fens bred horrid Riots but since we have been here all goes Smooth -- . I hope you do us the Justice to bellieve we heartily regreate the present Interuption of the pleasures we proposed ourselves in yr Neighbourhood & Society & that we shall ever Esteem ourselves Happy in any Oportunity to Renew it ; but otherwise we have changed much for the better especialy as Mr Samuel s House extravagantly dear as it was would have proved too Small for the Augmentation we hope for to our familly -- here we have an Excellent House , room enough & plenty of good Furniture -- . I agree wt yr Pappa in thinking the Ruſsian dispatch was sent to the Second hand first ; the Hurry they are were in I fansy made them not send above one Letter to a familly to be transmitted through the different Branches of it -- : I imagine they are now more at Leisure haveing received a long Letter Yesterday from yr Aunt -- my Br : is remarkably well & the rest very much so ; their own House not yet fitted up to receive them they are all in good Spiritts & she infinatly pleas 'd wt their Situation & the Usage they meet with -- so its to be hoped all will go well to the end wt them . What a schocking affair was that of Mr Arden s : Im sorry Mrs Isted trains her Eleve 's no better & hope the Widow will alwise remain so . Adieu my Dear Miſs Hamilton pray write soon & bellieve me Ever most Sincearly Yours & c & c & c M A Napier Enclose my Letter under Covers to John Hope Esqr .
