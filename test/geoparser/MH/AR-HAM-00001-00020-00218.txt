71 , Queen Street 26 th - Septr- 1807 My Dear Sister , How could You wonder at my not writing to You ? You say that You commanded me to do so . It is true , that you did ; and your having done so , explains the reason why I did not write . With the recollection of your habitual disobedience , fresh in my Memory , how could You suppose that I would not profit by it , when it suited my conveniency . Certainly , when I arrived at home , it was my intention to tell You , that I had reached my Domicile without any strange Adventures . And , it is not above three days ago , that I interrogated my family , with the view of discovering whether any of them had heard me say that I had written to Mrs- Dickenson since I came home . Not one of them could say Yes , or No , on the subject . So , I comforted myself with the belief , that I had done so . And should have been convinced of it , had not Your Scrap of Paper undeceived me , this Morning . In the first place , my most extreme acknowledgements are due to Mr . & Miſs Dickenson , for the kind escort they gave me , and for the trouble Mr. D . took in opening half a hundred Gates . When I got to Stony Stratford , I found the Cathcarts so reasonable ( as indeed they always have been ) as to let me proceed on my Journey that Evening . By this means , I slept at Welford on the Monday Night ; reached Sir John Warren 's before Dinner on Tuesday ; left Stapleford Hall , at Seven in the Morning on Wednesday ; dined at Newcastle on Thursday ; drunk Tea there , with Mrs- George Clavering , & then went on to sleep at Framlington ; started from thence at Six O'Clock in the Morning of Friday , and arrived at my own Door before Ten O'Clock at Night , to the great & unexpected Satisfaction of all the Family , who did not look for me sooner , than dinner Time on Saturday . On Sunday , I received a Note from Admiral Vashon telling me to send my Son Francis to Leith , by Ten O'Clock next Morning , that he might be put on board a King 's Ship , and sent off to seek his Fortune on the Mighty Deep . This Summons was obeyed , and the Boy sailed in the Shannon Frigate to arrive for a short time in the North Seas , & then to be conveyed to the Southward , where he is to join Captain Adam , in the Resistance Frigate , as soon as he can meet with her . We have had one Letter from him since he sailed , written in high Spirits . He had experienced no Sea Sickneſs , though the weather had been rough , and the Shannon had taken a prize . A few days , after shipping off Francis , my duty , as Lieutenant of Selkirkshire , took me to that County , to set the new Militia Act agoing . At present , I am , in State , in my Library , surrounded by the Portraits of many of my Ancestors , smiling ( or grinning if you please ) very graciously , on their hopeful Representative . This instant , I am interrupted , by a living Scyon of the family , who I have sent up Stairs to my Lady , to remain there peaceably till I have done scribbling , and that I shall now do , as quickly as poſsible . Your Congratulations to Lady Cathcart will not be delivered by Me , as She is in the Country with her Sister Lady Kinnaird . I did not fail instantly to aſsure her how much I was gratified by her Lord 's Succeſs & good Conduct , at Copenhagen . Indeed , I was most sincere , for I do not think it poſsible for any body to have behaved with more prudence , humanity , and propriety than he has done ; and I do trust , that his Services will be rewarded as they ought to be . I see they have already given his Son Frederick , a Troop of Dragoons . By the bye , he is a most uncommon steady young Man . My best wishes attend Your Husband , your Daughter , & your Ball . The papers will announce the grand Illumination of the Grand Saloon at Leighton House ; the Gardens & Grotto decorated with coloured Lamps , so as to darken the Light of the Moon & c. & c. & c . Rib , begs her Civilities ; as I do mine to my Countrywoman . Adieu . Ever Your faithful Friend & Affectionate Brother Napier
