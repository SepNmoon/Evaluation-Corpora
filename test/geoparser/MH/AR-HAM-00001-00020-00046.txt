Welwyn , 13 th . March 1781 . This days Post made me extremely happy -- It brought me my Dear Sister s letter , in which she does not accuse me of a want of friendship for not accepting her very generous proposal ; and the Accounts of Mrs- Hunter having upon the 6 th . of the Month presented me with A Nephew . So you may now salute me , Uncle as soon as You please . I aſsure you I am quite proud of my new Dignity ; when we meet you will find me more saucy ( if poſsible ) than ever . Accept of my Gratitude for your good wishes . I may perhaps some time of my Life enjoy a competent fortune , tho ' not an Affluent one . I am however determined to enjoy & be thankful for what is now in my power viz . Content -- Happy in the esteem & confidence of a few sincere friends . I 'll e'en make the best of a bad bargain , & comfort myself with the re c ollection that All things under the Sun are Vanity & Vexation of Spirit . I shall be happy to see Mr- Farhill . I can not promise him amusement in this barbarous Village , but I will promise him a hearty welcome . As I have just disposed of my Ensigncy I may perhaps be obliged to visit Town to receive the payment , in which case I will give him a personal invitation . This intended Trip is only a perhaps & not to be depended upon . Lady Cathcart continues to be what she ever was -- wonderful -- and looks better than she has done for some time past . I now hope that She will do well . She seems to think so herself having just ordered a new Post Chaise to be built for her . God grant she may live to order another . She is really a Valuable Life . Her best wishes ever attend You -- I am sorry for what you write about a certain Person -- I had before heard of his situation , which I hoped would have made him see his folly . I do n't think his intimacy with his R . Uncle will do him much good -- I feel for the K . & Q . As you wish to know how matters stand between Ld- C . & your humble Servant I have subjoined a Copy of the correspondence which has paſsed -- Conscious of having acted with all proper Attention to his Lordship & the whole Set I am the leſs concerned at their behaviour to me , but I am determined for the future to take no Notice of them 'till They shew Attention to me . Adieu . Beleive me ever Yours very sincerely & affectionately N—— . Ld- N . s Letter to Ld . C—— London 9 th . Febry- 1781 . My Dear Lord , A few days before my arrival in Town I recd- a letter from Dr. Hunter enclosing Copies of his letter to You & of your answer to it . As your Lop/ seems to wish the points in dispute should be settled by yourself with me , Dr. Hunter & my Sisters have directed me to state some facts which you at present appear to be unaquainted with . It was my intention & desire to have conversed with You in person upon the subject of my Mother s portion , but as your Lop/ did not give me an opportunity of doing so , I feel myself under the neceſsity of taking this method of communicating my Sentiments to You . Your Lop/ may recollect that Mr- Orr who had the management of my father s busineſs died in the latter end of the Year 1774 . The decease of my Father in Janry- 1775 before his papers were recovered from Mr- Orr 's heirs threw all my Affairs into the utmost confusion , & it was not 'till a Year after Mr- Orr s death , that my Vouchers came into Mr- Buchan s poſseſsion . Upon an application being made to your father to settle the Accompts due by him to my Sisters , he directed that Mr- Buchan should make out a state of my Mother s portion still unpaid , which he accordingly did & was aſsisted in it by Mr. Chas- Brown . It is unneceſsary for me to remind your Lop/ that a stop was put to that settlement by the death of your father whose friendship & kindneſs to my family & myself I shall ever most gratefully recollect . When I returned from America , being desirous to have all Money matters settled with my Sisters , I repeatedly applied to Mr. C. Brown to ascertain the Sum due from your Lop/ to my Sisters & as often received his promises to do so . Wearied with numberleſs delays , I one morning waited upon Mr- Brown with my Vouchers in my pocket & it was not 'till that day that I was informed the Accompts could not be adjusted , as a considerable difference appeared between the State given in by Mr- Buchan & that exhibited by Mr- Brown , as your Lop/ arrival in England was daily expected , I gave my consent to stop all proceedings 'till your return & prevailed upon the Guardians to approve of what I had done , from the supposition that You would yourself either have made a diligent search amongst your Papers or have impowered some proper person to have made that search for You . I have only now to request that you will give directions to your Agents in Scotland to make such enquiries as will enable them speedily to settle this Busineſs to the satisfaction of all Parties . I shall expect your answer at Welwyn for which place I shall set out as soon as my Servant returns from delivering this letter . I ever am & c & c & c . Ld- C—— to Ld . N—— , My Dear Lord , I found your letter on my Table at my Return from Portsmouth last Night . I will take an early opportunity of writing to your Lop/ fully on the Subject it contains , in the mean time I seize the first Moment to aſsure your Lop/ of the Mortification it gives me that some Public & much Private Busineſs , did not allow me leisure to seek an interview . with you during your stay in Town , the more so as that hurry has now ceased . I have the Honor to be with the greatest Regard ever my Dear Lord N—— most faithful and attached Humble Servant . C—— Albemarle Street 13 Febry- 1781 . Since the receipt of the above letter my most faithfull & attached humble Sert- has taken no further Notice of me . N——
