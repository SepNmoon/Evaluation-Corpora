4 , Suffolk Street Charing Croſs 7 th - April 1802 My Dear Sister , I hope to escape from this dusty , expensive Town , on Thursday the 22 d . Inst- . Such is my plan , if I dont succeed in my Views ; if I do , it may either occasion my departure suddenly , or delay me for another week . At all events , I do not mean to be here , longer than the last day of this Month . Mr. Dundas is in Town , and was to be with Lord Pelham today . I trust , my matter may then be fixed , or that They will candidly say , it can not be done . Ministers You know are callous Animals , and like to make people dance after them as long as poſsible . This suits not with my irritability of Temper . I wish that some of the Blood Royal would ask me , about You , and then I would give such a description of you , as would excite their Curiosity , to examine into the Truth of it , by commanding You to appear in their presence . When You left the Palace , my advice was , that You should appear at the Drawing Room , which would have shewn that You was not disgusted with the Inhabitants of it . But , being a willful Miſs , you would not do as I bid You , which I am convinced nettled our Gracious Q . My daughter will remain here , after my departure ; but , she knows not of it yet . Only think of their sleeping at Northampton , in their way to Town , without telling me of their intention . It would have been so easy for You to have seen her then . I can tell you nothing of Miſs Law , except that the Cumberland Counteſs consents to the Match . No money , I imagine , & I even believe that I misnamed the Son . It is , Charles , the Captain in the Scotch Greys . The Counteſs herself told me of it . I am happy to Frank for You at any time . Love to Mr. Dickenson & Louisa , best wishes to my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister Your Affecte- Brother Napier London , Seventh April 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
