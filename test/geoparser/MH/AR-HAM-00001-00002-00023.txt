20 July 1789 -- Bath N o . 18 Queen 's Square In the afternoon I went with Major Murray Mr . Mrs . & Miſs Davies & Mr . & Mrs. Deering to Lincom Spa where we drank Tea I thought of your going to this place with your dear friends every step of the Way -- how happy I should have been to have had you with me -- You I have not mentioned Mr . & Mrs. Deering before -- she was Miſs Basta , Mrs. Glover 's acquaintance , who married an Irishman -- there never was a Match of that kind that turned out better -- he poſseſses enormous merit in his behaviour to her -- his attentions are delightful & seem to come from the heart -- She doats upon him as she ought to do -- He lived in their house for a considerable time before he married & Mrs. Davies gives him an excellent Caracter -- they have a house in the Square & are very intimate wh- this family -- 21/ I sat some time with Dr. Fothergill this morning , and Drank Tea with the Isted 's -- they told me that Mrs. Milnes ( who a day or two ago sent her Cards of Thanks ) had had a relapse & was to go to Bristol the next morning -- I went immediately to make my enquiries -- whilst I was talkg to the Servant Miſs M . heard my Voice & sent an order for my admittance She said she wanted to see me & did not know how to contrive it -- She seemed greatly distreſsed as She had given up all expectations of Mrs. M 's recovery who 's disorder is an inflammation upon her Lungs -- She has sat up with her constantly & has scarce ever taken her clothes off -- & seems quite worn to a Shadow -- I make no doubt but she will suffer materially in her health whether her Mother dies or recovers -- I staid 20 minutes & left a Lady with her -- ( She sent her Love to you ) and returned to the Isted 's where I staid till 9 oClock -- the Isteds have taken a house for the Season I ca n't call it Summer , about 8 miles from hence & one from Mrs. Methuen 's -- I promised to spend a day with them , & they promised to take me to Mrs. Methuen 's -- 22/ I called on the Rundells this morning -- at 8 I went to Mrs. Hartley 's by appointment & found there Mrs. Farmer , Mrs . & Miſs Egerton & ye- 2d Miſs Isted -- they went away before 10 & then I had a pleasant Tete a tete with Mrs. H . till eleven ; we had Jellies & biscuits for our supper -- She spoke of young Mr. Locke s extraordinary Genius for painting & promised to shew me some of his sketches -- She said that he never had a Master -- but had had very great advantages from his Eye being accustomed from his earliest infancy to see the most perfect Models & the finest paintings Mrs. Locke told her that when he was at Rome & only 4 Year 's old he shewed a predilection for fine statues which he would have stood gazing at for hours -- his Taste was formed so early that every figure he draws is beautiful from its perfect symmetry -- when he was very young his natural turn was for the most horrid subjects , one of which she described -- the subject was his own invention entirely -- a witch was supposed to have killed a woman & her two Children in a Cottage -- the poor Husband on his return home is suffered to take up a Child in each arm which hang in delightful attitudes -- & the woman in her last agonies grasps his by which the Man seems totally insensible of & he appears to stand petrified with horror or grief -- the Witch was finely described with a bloody dagger in each hand seeming to tread on Air and to enjoy the horrid Scenes with an Air of Diabolical Exultation all this was so exquisitely finished , that it made an impreſsion on his mind & a Servant , luckily going into his Room after he went to bed , found him in a state of violently agitated Spirits -- for he fancied that he saw the Scene which he had described paſs before him in reality , & they were obliged to give him something to raise his Spirits & to stay in his room till he he fell aſleep -- Mrs. H . says that his Fancy , Taste & Execution can hardly be equalled -- She mentioned several little anecdotes which I hope to recollect by way of expelling ye- Ennui when yr- pauvre mari returns to you -- 23/ I breakfasted this morning with Dr. Fothergill & at my return I had the delight of receiving yours of the 18 th - Yes my dearest dearest Mary , I will go to Lady Fust 's -- & go or do any thing & every thing that you desire or can wish -- it is impoſsible for me to tell you how sincerely I love you & how dear you are to my Heart -- God bleſs You -- best of Women What a Gadabout Mrs. Morrison is become -- I hope she is amused -- I am very fond of her -- how I admire Louisa 's attention to her Dormouse with what eagerneſs she will shew it to papa -- I will bring her something from this place , but I am at a loſs to know what wd . be most acceptable to her -- Tho the conduct of Ld . W—— may appear unkind -- yet I think it on many Accts . justifiable & even right -- he can not shew himself to be a zealous friend to government without exerting his influence to the utmost in its behalf -- I could not have supposed that there had been so much firmness of Character -- but in weak minds there is generally to be found the greatest degree of opiniatrete -- I dont mean entirely to direct that Idea to him because there is sense & parts , as well as Levity & some thing Hamiltonian if you will allow the expreſsion -- in his Character , which makes it a complete Medley -- I feel an attachment to him & should receive great pleasure in an opporty of manifesting it -- & am sorry that he is not generally liked -- which a proud , reserved Man can never be -- if Ld . W . acts from patriotism he is right -- or if he looks forwards to his own Children 's interest he is right to shew himself an active friend -- but if he acts from personal resentment or caprice I should condemn him -- How perfectly I see our dear Ly . Frances looking & talking over the alterations of her house -- how much she would have to say & how busy she will be in Idea -- I really love her & I dont wonder that my Mary is the first upon her List -- I staid at home all day -- 24/ I did not go to any of my Masters this morning -- for reasons wch . I shall explain tomorrow -- I sat writing Italian & c for 7 hours without intermiſsion except a visit of more than ½ hour from Dr. Fothergill at 7 I went to ye- Vanbrughs , & found there a large party of Humdrums & tittering Miſses -- I staid an hour & went to Mrs. Hartley s where I found Mrs. Holroyed , whom she invited on purpose to meet me -- also Lord Scarborō & a Clergyman whose name is Bosnet -- Lord S . seems to have drank his senses away -- I believe he was sober , but he talked an abundance of Nonsense , in so low a tone of Voice & so slow , that it kept alive all one 's attention to gueſs even at his meaning but his engroſsing all the conversation made me wiſh him -- I wont say where -- but only for a minute -- our conversation was stupid -- at ten une Table service avec une tres jolie petite Soupe came into the room -- upon Castors -- Mrs. Hartley was wheeled to it & we all took our places -- I had no sooner seized upon the Leg of chicken than Ld . S : began to tell a ridiculous story about his refusing to say Goose when a Child & his punishment for the act of disobedience -- he rang the changes of his manner of spelling Go-go-Goo-goo-Goose- D oose -- & so on with Do-D : oo . & c till I was ready to burst & was obliged to run from the Table -- & give way to a violent fit of laughing -- Mrs. Hartley could hardly support her herself & poor Mrs. Holroyd made faces -- all this time Lord S : sat staring with the most perfect Sang froid with his hand clenched except one solitary finger which was alternately applied to the corner of one Eye or his mouth -- this ridiculous story continued for half an hour -- at eleven we all came away & contrary to my usual custom -- w I went to bed sober -- 25/ I am all alive & in excellent Spirits this morning , from which I give you lea f v e to conclude that it has not been the case with me lately -- I will run back for a few days -- on Tuesday morning I found my self very uncomfortable -- I perceiv 'd that Bathing increased my Irritation & shattered my Nerves my appetite was gone & I had a tightneſs & pain in my head from all which I inferred that my health was in a retrograde Motion -- I hastened , after my resolution was taken , to D r . Fothergills , whom I luckily found at home -- we went thrō the Cerimony of the watch & pulse & c questions & Answers -- The Dr . told me that he thought Antemonials would not answer so well for me , as Acids which he meant to try -- he said that the degree of heat of the Bath ought to have been properly regulated , that from the heat of the Atmosphere -- the water in which I had bathed , had been many degrees too warm -- he desired me to go home & take an Emetic directly which I d id but no Bile appeared -- & in half an hour I took some of the Acid -- which had almost an immediate Effect -- for since Tuesday the Itching which was become intolerable has to almost totally been asleep and I have not a doubt but it will have the Complaisance to bid me a friendly Adieu before I leave Bath -- my appetite returned the next day & I called to thank the Dr . for having made me so happy -- I may use that Expreſsion -- as lowneſs of Spirits creates real Misery -- for the unfortunate Martyr -- sees Devils of all Colors & shapes dancing before him -- I had not had the honor of being introduced to such company , but was en train -- I must return to Fo- thergill whom I could not persuade to take a Fee his answer was “ No , no , what I do for you , you must attribute to old Freindship ” -- he desired me to breakfast with him on Thursday -- when I called on Wednesday he was not at home -- Now for another matter -- p b ut first I must kiſs your fair hand & lead you back again to Monday when a Gnat had the impertinence to feast upon my Leg -- I took no other notice of this presumption , than to form a resolution not to touch the polluted part -- Tuesday I wore my Boots all day & at night found my Leg violently inflamed & the head of the swelling rubbed off -- I applied spirits of Wine & water the next day without Effect -- on Thursday Morng Dr. F—— desired to look at it & ordered me to take an Aperient & to save a day , at 12 oClock -- this was a new Kind of Salt , very powerful in the Diuretic way -- & thrō the whole proceſs , the least unpleasant of any operation of that Nature I ever experienced -- The Dr . said -- the inflammation was owing to the water 's having forced the Bile to the Surface of the Body -- on weds Dr. F—— desired me to put a poultice to it which I did -- & kept one upon the Leg till yesterday morning when I found the place healed -- Now Madam you may Acct . for my poor Legs having a Holliday , & may also suppose that they are returned to their usual occupation of capering & kicking at every obstacle -- poor Mrs. Hartley wrote me a kind note to say “ the Gates of the Castle should be thrown open to receive so renowned a Knight ” -- I have the Vanity to think she will feel for my disappointment -- I wrote to her on Thursday to let her know -- that I wd . go to Cowslip Green the first day I could put on a Boot -- I repeated the offer of a Fee to Hannah More which he again refused -- however I will tender him five guineas before I leave Bath -- which he probably will not accept -- he seems pleased with being consulted by me -- I shall scribble to you all day -- I happy I shd . be to talk to you & to see you Dr. F -- I fancy that my dearest Mary often visits “ Iza 's own pitty vole ” & that she is often in the Hay feild with Grandpapa -- we have not had one fair day day since monday , & enjoy ourselves every Evening over a snug fire -- pray send me a recipe to make a Chartreuse pie -- in return for which you shall have one for a pie that will please Louisa -- Now dont be figitty about me -- I am every day complimented upon my good Looks & never felt my self better than I am at this moment which is the most agreeably employed in subscribing myself , my charming wife 's affectionate & faithful -- Mr. D Kiſses in abundance for my own J——D—— -- & Love to Louisa -- 25 th July Saturday My return must now depend upon Ampa -- My leg is quite well -- To Dr. F—— Taxal Chapel le frith X post } Derbyshire
