Madam I have recd the favor of your Letters of Wednesday & Thursday last , & last night I also recd one from Mrs D'Salis , in which she mentions her Intention of coming into the Country on Tuesday , & very Kindly offers to bring Miſs Mary Jackson in her Chaise with her , which I will communicate to her to Day & Have no doubt but she will be ready to attend Mrs D'Salis With respect to what you mention as to Mr Cooke -- Upon the death of Mr Jackson he called at the House & offered to attend his funeral if it was agreeable . I inquired of Mr Roſs , Mr Jackson s Clerk , who he was , & he informed me he was a Music Master & had taught the young Ladies ; he attended the e funeral & I have seen him occasionally at their House & as far as I have heard he is very respectable in his Profeſsion ; he furnishes them with Music & instructs them , which I understand he offered to do out of respect to the memory of Mr Jackson witht any Gratuity ; I do n't know of his Partiality for Miſs Mary , but have very recently heard it suspected that he had a preferrence to Miſs Jackson , tho ' not sufficiently for me to take any part in it , I shall however take an opportunity of mentioning it to Mrs Bates witht mentioning your name or that I have heard any thing from you abt it . Mr Cooke may be a very respectable man in his Profeſsion , as I learn that he is , but I dont by any means think him a proper Alliance for Miſs Jackson , if therefore it shd turn out that an thing of this kind is going on I shall be very happy too confer with you & Miſs Clarke & act agreeable to your Wishes , having myself a great desire to do every thing in my power to promote the happineſs & comfort of the young Ladies . I am Madam Your very Obt Servt John Kinderley Symonds Inn 28 April 1798 Mrs Dickinson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard
