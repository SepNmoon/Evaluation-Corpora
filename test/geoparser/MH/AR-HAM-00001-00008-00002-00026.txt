Lodge Decr . 8 -- My dear Mrs Dickenson -- I must write to Expreſs my Gratitude to you & Mr D : for your kind Solicitude respecting my Health . I have indeed been very ill. for the short time it lasted . it was very Severe -- but I had one consolation . that of being at home . quite at my ease & when compar 'd to my Situation this day time 12 Months it was realy a Bed of roses -- I am now free from all complaints . I am still reasonably Weak however I increase in Strength hourly -- & begin to hope I shall be able the latter end of next week to undertake my Journey . to paſs my xmaſs at Newsells and Audley End -- there I am sure to find pleasant Society -- & the change of Air will . be of service to me . & it shortens the Winter -- I do take your kind advice as I ought my dear friend -- being aſsure 'd of yr goodneſs to me -- I certainly shall not venture out in a hurry . not that I think this was a Cold -- it was a billious Seizure . & attended with great fever . I have had no Cough -- What I go upon is to make the best of my Situation I like Society -- & when I look 'd abroad amongst the French Emigrants -- & heard of Dukes & Ducheſses . who had lived in luxury far beyond what I had ever been us 'd to -- when old Comte Montbrison at 81. could go up the outside of the Richmond steps morning & Evening . I felt if these people could confer & make the best of their Situation . I ought to try hard viz to make my life easy -- but as pleasant as I had the means of making it -- I grieve to hear of poor dear Mr D—— s complaint : be aſsur 'd that the Advice I give comes fr Sir Francis Milman -- every morning take a sponge into the Coldest Water . ( if Ice so much the better ) & bathe that part -- it gives immediate ease . & certainly frees that part which is diseas 'd for relaxation -- at the same time to take some Pill so as to keep the body open -- it is a Wretched painful disorder , tho ' certainly not a dangerous one -- I have had many sitters during my confinement the best News is . that Lord Pelham told a Gentleman -- who told a Gentleman . which last Gentleman told my Nephew . that the last Act of the preſent Sessions will be the repeal of that Inquisitorial power Sir -- a Great friend of Addington s -- told my Aunt St Leger that he does not mean to please -- as that Inquisitor did -- & the leading story of Mrs Markham , who has eloped from her Husband leaving his nine Children -- she was Unsuspected to the End . & seized her departure -- her poor husband Husband has investigated her Conduct . & finds that out of his Children . three are his the other six are doubtful -- she is the last Woman I ever should have suspected . so Modest . so Gentle . & so respected as a pattern for a Wife & Mother -- neither her Father ( Sir Richd Sutton ) or the Arch Bishop s family will contribute a sixpence to her support . & the story goes that Lady Bath has taken her under her Protection . poor Mrs Leathes has paid dear for the invitation to these Theatricals , after the last representation . Lady C : in order to secure return 'd in Sir Archibald Edmonstone s Coach -- being her Cousin Mrs Johnson & Mrs Leathes s. Just as they were going into Bushy Park Miſs Holland with a pair of hired Post Horses drew furiously by them . Lady C : Coachman drove a turn at the round Pond in Bushy Park . the Chaise took one side . & ly C : 's Chariot the other . Unfortunately they met at the top of the Pond . The Carriages entangled , & they went several yards together . at last Lady C—— s Coachman with an Effort extricated himself from the other carriage . was thrown off his Box . & broken two bones & one leg -- the Horses finding themselves without a driver ran thro ' all the gates . & came into Hampton Court Palace yard where there were loose stones -- they however stopp 'd at Lady C—— s door . 2 Centinels seeing them without a driver stood at the head of the Horses -- whilst these poor Women were taken out . but it was with difficulty they could keep them . for the Animals were work 'd up to phrenzy -- the Ladies were unhurt . but cover 'd with Mud . for they had the presence of mind to take down the Glaſses -- Mrs Leathes has been ill with seizures and indeed I am not surpris 'd at it -- but did you ever hear of such an Escape -- Harry Baily has been at Hastings -- & my sister writes me word that he gives a most satisfactory account of every body & every thing at Wing -- so you see what dependance is to be plac 'd upon any one in the form of a servant after what he told you last year . ( but that my Sister never knew nor ever will hear -- ) I will certainly write her yr kind remembrances -- as I will to our dear Mrs Carter -- Mrs Jalabert has seen Mrs J Pitt . & Mrs Iremonger -- they give a most comfortable account of our dear venerable friend -- she is coming soon to Town -- & has been prevail 'd upon to come quietly in a Post Chaise -- many thanks for the offer of the Book which will be my sole useful reading -- Consul at Cairo so many years . must have pick 'd up much Information . Useful as well as interesting -- one feels surpris 'd that a Country from where all Arts Sciences had their beginning . is now Escaped from a hoard of Ruffians , who cd have destroy 'd any vestiges only for the sake of destroying the Authenticity of the Bible -- Adieu my dear Mrs Dickenson . my best remembrances ever attend Mr & Miſs Dickenson -- believe me yr most affect & obliged Friend DBloſset .
