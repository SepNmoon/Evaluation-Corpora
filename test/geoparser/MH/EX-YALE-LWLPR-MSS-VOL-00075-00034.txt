St James 's Place Monday Tho ' I am full of the honours I receiv 'd yesterday which I shall cherish as a cordial drop , they do not so much engroſs my mind as to make me forget that my Dear Miſs Hamilton was far from well and I am very anxious to know how she does to Day -- I have had a pretty good acct from Whitehall -- that Her Grace was better last night after her return home ; but the hour of the Day is not yet come that is to give me entire Satisfaction . it will be hard to and mortifying to me if My much esteem 'd and Honourable guests shou 'd suffer when I find myself so much better in health and spirits from their kind indulgence to my Dear Madam yr most affectte and obliged MDelany
