recd . 5 th . Decbr . 1779 Sunday Morng ¼ before 10 o'Clock My dear Friend , It is impoſsible for me my Miranda to find time to write you any thing longer during ye . whole Course of ye . Winter , longer than a common Note & sorry am I to d ſ ay so but so Fate has ordained , even the time for writing this little Billet I am obliged to take from ye my resting time , therefore you see how distreſsed I am for time . I was del a i ghted at ye . Play last Night , & was extremely moved by two scenes in it , especially as I was particularly interested in ye . appearance of t b h e most beautiful Woman , yt . ever I beheld , who acted with such delicacy yt . she drew tears from my eyes , she perceiv ed how much my attention was taken up with her , not only during her acting but when she was behind ye . Scenes , & contrived e v e ry little innocent art to captivate a heart but too susceptible of receiving every impreſsion she attempted to give it , & Alas . My Miranda my friend , she did but too well succeed , consider wh . is almost impoſsible , & allow wh . is next to impoſsibility for ye . lively & strong & lively passions of a Young Man glowing with ye . utmost Warmth of desire , & yet feeling himſelf incapable of gratifying his darling . Her name is Robinson , on or off ye . Stage for I have seen her both , she is I believe almost ye perfectest greatest & most perfect beauty of her sex . Yr . friendſhip my ever dearest Miranda , requiring of me from yr . own ingenuousneſs & from my voluntary promise , ever thing relating to me , therefore you shall hear every thing relating to this affair , this paſsion has laid dormant in my bosom for some time , but last Night has kindled it again to such a degree for what can be more moving interesting , or aimiable than exquisite beauty in distreſs ) yt . Heaven knows when it will be extinguished . Pardon me , pity me , comfort me , my heart is already something easier by having imparted to you My Miranda what I have not another Friend I can strictly call so to whom I cld . with implicit confidence impart it . But to you I can in whose honor I put such credit , un . because I know every secret of mine lays as secure in yr . Bosom , as in ye . silent grave . However pardon me my dearest Sister if I desire you to be particularly cautious about this for were it ever to reach My Parents ears , I am fearful tho ' so dear to me they never wld pardon me . I can now only add yt . yr . correspondance affords me more delight than ever , & you have highly offended me you saucy Puss in supposing yt . I was grown tire of it , let me hear no more of this you gracious Madam however to clear up all doubts you may have for ye . future upon this head , believe me when I say that mon amitié pour vous est indiſsoluble . God Bless you & preserve you . I am Yr . very affectionate Brother Palemon toujours de même . P. S . I am happy to hear such good accounts of dear M. G . I despise all foolish Stories as beneath me My Miranda I like however to know ym . A . A . A . toujours chère Oh ! Mrs. Robinson
