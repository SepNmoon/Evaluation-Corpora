I hope , my dear Miſs Hamilton , you can tell me your Mama is better , & that you are in Spirits to reliſh the Comedy I ſend you . -- I laugh 'd , 'till my Sides were ſore , at it , laſt night ; -- but , with me , all pleaſure is incomplete , if I can not ſhare it with my Friends . -- You 'll find part of young Marlow 's Character very like a Perſon 's of our Acquainta nce ; -- the defective part of it , I mean ; not the virtuous & most meritorious . -- I alſo ſend you the Copy of my political Letters which I promised you . -- I hope you will not , now , think the Publication ſo very abſurd ; when I tell you , that I foreſaw my preſent Embarrassment , & that I ſhould have no other better means of ſhaming my Relations into doing ſomething for me , than by making as much Noise in the World as I poſsibly could , without doing any thing to injure my Relations ; -- for that ſame Reaſon I publiſh 'd the Letter ( you 'll find with These ) which at firſt gave Meſsrs : Hope & amp ; Co : uneasineſs , but which I knew could never hurt Them , & would intereſt them in preventing me from becoming a Bankrupt . -- My chief own interest , however , was but the ſecondary motive of that laſt Publication . -- I really imagined it would be of immediate publick ſervice , & in the End would aggrandize the Character of my old Patrons . -- I 'll conclude with a Reflection applicable to the subject : -- Those who paſs for the most prudent & wiſe , in the World , ſeldom can carry on a Design , without being d e i scovered . -- The y Eyes of every one is upon them ; their every action is watched with the moſt ſuſpicious attention , & they can undertake nothing , without every one putting himſelf on his Guard , as if ſomething momentous was intended to happen . -- The man , on the contrary , who paſses for a thoughtleſs , rattling fellow , can do what he pleaſes , without even being ſuspected of looking farther than his Nose before him . -- In anſwer to all this Nonſense , give me juſt two Lines , to ſay how your Mama does ; & that , in thus opening a little more of my ma ways & manners ( as you call 'd them ) I have loſt nothing in the Eſteem of my dear good Friend . -- Her 's most ſincerely & Affecly
