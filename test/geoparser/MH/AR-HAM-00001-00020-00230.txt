27 , S t . James 's Street 26 th . Janry- 1809 My Dear Sister , I was very unexpectedly hurried away from Home to attend Parliament , much against my Will . Fortunately , the Frost continued during the whole of my Journey . The Weather since my arrival has been most execrable , and , as it is now raining & thawing , my patience is almost exhausted , for I have been chiefly confined to my Lodgings , & to the House of Lords since I came to Town . So that except two of my Aunts , & Lady Clavering , I have met with none of my Cronies . What have You done with the Genealogical Paper , I sent You ? I fear , You are lazy . I can give You little information about Mr. Hamilton , further than that he is of a very good Gentleman 's family ; by profeſsion , a Writer of the Signet , that is an Attorney of the first Claſs ; & goes by the Name of Apollo , why , or wherefore , I can not tell You . It is impoſsible that he could have made £12,000 , in six Years by his busineſs . He may , however , have made it , by speculating in buying & selling Land . It was formerly reported , that the cause of Miſs Wynne leaving Edinburgh so precipitately some time ago , was to avoid the importunity of this Mr. Hamilton . I can give You no News , because , I have none . I had four first Cousins of the name of Napier in the Battle of Corunna . Three of them were Sons of my Uncle George & Lady Sarah Napier . The eldest of these was killed . The rest escaped unhurt . She , poor Woman , is quite blind . Her feelings are warm , and acute ; but , although the blow has indeed been severe , She shews much resignation , and submiſsion to the Will if the Almighty , and appears most thankful that the Lives of her two other Sons have been preserved . I am just going to call for her , if the weather will permit me to walk as far as Cadogan Place , for , in this great Town , as well as in smaller ones , no Hackney Coach can be got , when it rains . I left all my Garrison well in Edinburgh . From my Eldest Son , I have heard nothing for Months past . My second Boy , is just come into Plymouth , to repair some damages the Resistance met with lately , in a violent Gale of Wind . I propose returning to Scotland about Easter , & if You are at home , shall beat up your Quarters . Adieu , my Dear Sister . With best Love to Mr- Dickenson & Louisa , I ever am , Your Affectionate Friend and Brother Napier London , Twenty Sixth January 1809 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
