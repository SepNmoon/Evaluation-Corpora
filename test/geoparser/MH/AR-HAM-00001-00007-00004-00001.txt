From Mr. Farhill wth . a present of a Tunbridge Box for Water Colors I pray you slight me not for I pride myself in being like you , always the same ; within also I am white , without I am wellpolished -- Like you I am sought for by all who pretend to Taste , and like you I am loved by all who poſseſs it . It is your 's to give Life , and Spirit to Objects inanimate : my Province also is the same . You banish Ennui ; and so do I -- nay more , we are both much admird by the same person : then slight me not : perhaps at some future Period I may recall to your Remembrance Scenes , which have lately paſsd ; and Persons , whom you have honor 'd by your Friendship ; the former , as they have been ever gay , and innocent , and the latter , as they are steady , and sincere , may I trust be reflected on with Complacency , & Pleasure . 28 th - August . 1780 .
