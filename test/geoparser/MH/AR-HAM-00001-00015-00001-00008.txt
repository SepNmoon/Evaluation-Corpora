Horton October 2 d 1785 My very dear Friend 's letter which I received an hour ago made me happier than I can expreſs -- Had I known how to direct to her I should not have waited till now to have inquired after you and given you some account of myself . Without delaying a Day longer I avail myself of the neceſsary information your letter contains , to write to you , beginning with the subject which gives me most pleasure to dwell upon , your happineſs -- The description you give of your present situation , and the Characters of those amiable People so nearly connected with you , breathes the spirit of happineſs and enjoyment -- Indeed my dear you are particularly marked amongst the fortunate , for however truly amiable was the object of your choice , however truly he was that of your affections , what a mere accident chance had you to find minds consonant to his and your own in the other part members of his Family -- you are so certainly among the very rare instances where so many advantages are united that I can not help wondering when I think of you , & thanking God most sincerely for having thus fixed your happineſs where it is so well deserved & will be so gratefully enjoyed -- To give you any regular account of myself since we parted , I must begin it soon after that with my going to Town on the 17 th of August -- The Day after that Drawing room I went down to Ly Carlisle 's who is at D . Place near Windsor -- you know it -- I spent that fortnight betwēn her and St Leonards , but chiefly at the last place -- after the Dr . of the 1 st September I went for a few Days to Richmond Park , & stayed the rest of the three Weeks , till the Coronation , with Ly Carlisle -- we had Company in the House both the time before and part of the last time , during which we made several very pleasant parties both by Water & Land -- went to Staines , Clivden , Park Place near Henley Genrl Conway 's you know , & one of the finest I ever saw -- we paſsed some part of every Day on the Water which was quite delightful , then the pleasantest warks & drives into the Forest -- the latterend of my visit tho ' was what I should have enjoyed the most , as I was left quite alone with Lady Carlisle , but that my dear Bell was so unwell that I could not be at a distance from her without suffering infinitly from anxiety -- my own Health however was perfectly good , and the exertions I always make to keep up my spirits , prevented me from receiving any other injury that that to my feelings -- I came here on the 23 d and had the satisfaction of finding Bell infinitly better , come down stairs , and free from some of her Complaints -- she still eats & sleeps little , but since I came her spirits are much improved -- I shall take her away with me on Wednesday , for a few Days to Town , & then to pay some visits to our Friends . Thank you a thousand times my very dear Friend for all your expreſsions of kinds & friendship , which tho ' perfectly uneceſsary & superfluous to my convictio n are still very pleasing & gratefully -- I should be truly happy to see you , tho I do not want you enough to make you leave your peaceful & happy home -- I shall return here no more this year , m y Father leaves this on the 31 st and London on the 15 th of November -- They mean to spend the in France , but where they have not yet fixed -- There is a trial preparing for me -- a separation from my beloved Sister and best Friend of six Months . It will be of use to her , that is my comfort , or at least my hope -- When do you think of coming to Town ? I suppose no plan of that kind is fixed -- I shall not be a fixture in London till after XmaſsChristmaſs -- adieu my dear pray return my love to Mr D -- not meaning that I do not accept of it , but that I am quite ready to pay him in kind -- I hope he is quite well , Bell desires her love to you & would have written had she been well -- my F 's best Compts & c to you both -- adieu your sincere & affec CMG—— To Mrs Dickenson at Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire single Sheet Honble Miſs Gunning Octbr . 1785
