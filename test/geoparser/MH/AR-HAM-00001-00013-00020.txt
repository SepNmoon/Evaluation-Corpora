Mr. Glover told me that before the termination of Hostilities with America he had presented a Memorial to Lord North , stating the impracticability of conquering America & that as the Independence of that Country must be established -- he offered a Plan for his Lordship 's Consideration by which he might repay this Country for the immense Sums expended in the prosecut ing ion of the War -- reestablish the Credit of the Nation & ruin France -- this plan was to withdraw the whole force from America at once , as there were Transports sufficient & ready & employ the whole Army in conquering the French West India Islands which he proved to the Minister would be an easy Task , as they were unprovided against so powerful an Attack -- Mr. Glover lamented that he could not induce Lord North to pursue Measures that would have been so advantageous to the Country & so honorably to himself
