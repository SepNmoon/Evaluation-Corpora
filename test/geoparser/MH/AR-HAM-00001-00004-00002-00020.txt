My dear Sir , I am much flatter 'd by your very kind letter which indicates the goodneſs of your heart in the oblivion of past misunderstandings which I equally regret their ever having taken place ; too ardent a disposition frequently leads us beyond the bounds of discretion but this is a subject to be no longer dwelt upon . I am very sorry to hear so unfavorable an account of Mrs. Dickenson 's health . I can not say much for my self on that score ; the consequences of the great loſs I have sustain 'd still bear very heavy upon me , which with the weight of years render me almost unfit for society , to which the circumstance of encreasing deafneſs adds much to the uncomfortableneſs of my situation & makes me totally averse to trouble my friends with my visits . I live in great solitude having even given up card parties , so that I may say my chief amusement is in trivial reading , which goes on but heavily at night on account of my eyes , which are failing as well as my other faculties . Mrs. Holman has left me near six weeks ago , she was but just recoverd from a very dangerous illneſs by the great skill of Dr. Parry who as well as myself had very serious apprehensions for her ; her disorder was brought on by the constant & severe agitation of her mind owing to the cruel treatment of her husband , whose plan seems to be no leſs than a total dereliction of her , leaving her without any provision but in entire dependence upon me ; this is a very cruel situation as I am certain her conduct towards him has always been most affectionate & proper . I have not neglected this opportunity of aſsuring Mrs. Holman that as long as I live she may depend upon my effectual aſsistance , & I have already made very ample provision for her after my decease by a considerable Annuity in Trust out the reach of her husband , she will therefore , if she survives me be in good circumstances if she does not suffer herself to be cajoled out of this Annuity or any part of it 's produce ; upon which subject I have given her my exhortations in very solemn terms . This Annuity has cost me a very large Sum by which I am totally deprived of ready money , tho ' with an advanced Income . My Trustees in this business are Chas . & Robt . Greville the former having conducted it . The idea of my unfortunate daughter being totally deserted after my decease , & depending upon the benevolence of her relations for her support , presented itself to me in all the horror attending such cruel circumstances , & the goodneſs of God inspired me with the desire of rescuing my Child really a deserving object , from such dreadful misery . She was hardly recover 'd when she expreſs 'd an improper impatience to return to London , not very flattering to me , & as she seems to have a very great dislike to Bath . I have have advised to endeavor to find out a residence suitable for her in London & to consult me upon the subject , in short nothing shall warp my affection from her . her addreſs without comment is n o . 35 Aldgate High Street London . I beg you will present my most affectionate regards to Mrs. Dickenson & to my worthy God daughter , whose behavior to her Parents must command universal approbation . I hope you will believe that I am sensible of the kindneſs of your invitation . In my present state of depreſs 'd spirits I shou 'd be a most unpleasant visitor I remain My dear Sir Your faithful humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St . Bath November 12 th . 1807 .
