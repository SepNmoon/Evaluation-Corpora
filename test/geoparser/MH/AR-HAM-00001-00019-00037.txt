Canterbury March 28 th - 1773 I got yours My dearest Mary of the 27 th instant last night which has given me the greatest concern imaginable & shall be most anxious till I hear Mrs Hamilton is out of danger and I charge you to take care of yr own health at the ſame time as you may hurt it wtout doing your Mama any good , a Daughters anxiety & care to nurse her Mother is natural usefull , & right but the more care she can take of herself the more uſefull she will be to her friends . write ſoon & I beg you may not stand on anſwers as I should be glad to have two lines every post just to ſay how she is -- you may be ſure you have my Prayers joined to yours for her happy recovery & believe me this knowledge of it will give me great pleaſure & God grant it may be ſoon & I am in hopes a daughters fears may may have made you more apprehendſive than otherwise you would have been had it been another perſon . I beg Pardon I shall not take the Alarm again so ſoon about attachments but my regard for My Dearest Girl was the occaſion of it , but had I conſidered yr good ſense a moment I might have ſafed myſelf much uneaſineſs . I inclose the only two franks I have to myſelf to you , please send the altered one first Adieu My dearest Ward I am just going my ride but would not let this post slip wt out without writing a few lines , believe me yours most affctly- W.
