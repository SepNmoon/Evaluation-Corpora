July -- 1789 -- I sent you a letter to day -- it never ceased to rain except at 2 OClock for 10 minutes , from the time I got up till 4 when Sir Robt . & Mr. Sawille came , Mrs. Davies gave us a very pretty dinner & I provided a desert of Fruit , which I knew they liked -- they staid with me till 7 & after drinking Tea I accompanied them into Gay Street to Mrs. Bowdler 's Sir Robt . asked me if he cd . be of any service to me in Paris , I told him that I had a particular commiſsion to give him -- “ & pray what is it ? to take care to bring back your Wife & Daughter safe , that I may have the pleasure of seeing them in the Spring -- There were at the Vanbrugh s Lady Mary Blair & her Daughter , who has a very fine countenance , but is so large & fat , that her Neck is like a young Womans of 16 -- a Mr. & amp ; Mrs. Poulter who is the person I mentioned to you , as having a likneſs to Ly De Vesci , She has been married 8 Years & has only 10 Children , if I had been a Roman Catholick I should have croſsed my self at the Idea -- Miſs Hay -- sister to Lord Kinnoul ) -- Mrs. L -- Mr. Villiers . Groom of the B.C . to the King -- Mr. Gibbon a young man & a Mr. Sandford -- we spent a very pleasant Evg . which paſsed in lively conversation -- & at ½ past 10 sat down to a Supper which you will conclude was elegant -- There were all sorts of Fruits & c & c -- I forgot a Mr- Berg , who was in the Law & is an agent to Mr. V . for the Opera busineſs -- he talked a great deal about the fire at that place & made it very clear that it was set on fire & he did not hesitate to say by whom -- there is the most positive presumptive proof but they can not yet bring it home to them -- after Supper the word Anthem was mentioned -- Mrs. V . who 's manner you are acquainted , begged that Mr. Sandford would favor us with an Anthem , which he did , after a due preparation of hemming and coughing -- but I can not call it a serious Anthem -- for it was the drollest Medley I ever heard -- it was very long & kept us on a roar the whole time -- I forgot to tell you that the Fire at Opera has clarified Mrs. Van 's Ears & entirely cured her Deafneſs -- They dont expect to lose any thing -- I came home before 12 -- / 13 / -- Sir Robt . Herries set out this morning for London -- This has been an extraordinary day of rain which has fallen in torrents with very little intermiſsion -- at 6 I was able to go to Dr. Fothergill s where I found a Mr. Willis who made many enquiries after after you & said a great many civil things -- he lives in the house adjoining to the Dr- s - -- There was also a Mr. Clavering & another man who was a very odd figure -- he is 6 foot high & thin -- he has a ruddy complexion , grey Eyes with large Eye brows of the deepest red , his Wig perfectly white to to set them off -- and a mouth distended nearly from Ear to Ear , with a set of large , shapeleſs , dirty Teeth placed zig zag acroſs this monstrous Fiſsure -- This person talked a great deal with wonderful & profound deliberation & was very decided in his Opinions -- the D r . smiled & seemed much pleased with my Visit -- The rain , which never ceased whilst I was there , detained me till past 9 , when I was obliged to venture thro it -- 14/ I met Mr. Willis at the pump Room & he introduced me to his Wife & he preſsed me to call upon him which I promised to do -- The post brought me two Letters this morning one from Grandpapa at Manr . with a ten pound Note inclosed , for which , I beg you will return him my thanks , as he ordered me to acknowledge the receipt of it to you & pray inform him as he is anxious about my health , that I feel myself , for the last 3 days in perfect health -- the only draw back is a little Rash upon my left Arm , which itches most intolerably -- every person compliments me upon the clarification of my Complexion & as far as I can judge , I never looked better -- the Weather is much against me , but I ought not to complain , when thousands suffer infinitely more from it than myself -- The other Letter came from your Uncle , I believe now I may stile him Mine -- “ Dear Sir -- on my return from the Opera late on Saturday night I found your very obliging letter , which would otherwise have been answered by return of post . I am sorry my Letter to Mrs. D . should have conveyed the Idea that by your continuing at Bath , the time you had fixed for so material an object as your health ; I might be exposed to a disappointment in the busineſs of raising the money for my Son 's Use , as I certainly imagined that if the Bond or Deed was executed at the time mentioned for your return , it would come soon enough . In Scotland Money is to be had only at certain periods , for instance Lammas or the 1 st of August is one of them , & if that paſses it can not be done till the next which is Martin mas or the 1 st of November . It is uncertain when a Vacancy may happen in the Regt . perhaps it may not till it would be perfectly convenient to me : but as I am rather of a punctual disposition , I could wish to be prepared to receive the offer , which I am told is a very great favor . This being the case , I can with difficulty find words to expreſs th e Sense of the obligation I feel myself under to you , for generous confidence in me , in making me such an Offer without the smallest par ade ; the favor done me on your part is most complete ; & the remembrance of it on mine will I trust be corresponding . I hope my Agent will be able to supply me ; for your diverting such a Sum from the purpose you have allotted it , for even a small period of time , might I am well aware be attended with a material inconvenience to you , & having found you so zealous in my Interest , I can not be too scrupulous in my Attention to yours , I must therefore with a thousand Thanks to you decline putting so heavy a Tax upon your friendship . I every day expect my Son home , & as you are so Kind , as to interest yourself in this matter , I shall not fail to acquaint you how it proceeds , for I shall be always happy in every opportunity of aſsuring you with how much truth I am Dear Sir Your faithful & Obliged hble Servant F. H . July 13.1789 P.S . Mr. Greville is going out of Town , having parted with his house so that you will please not to send any more Letters under cover to him . ” I see great pleasure from this letter as I know that it will make you very happy -- it appears that he was astonished at the confidence which I placed in him , & to find , that I proposed to do him a great Act of friendship , without any profeſsions , was what the natural coldneſs of his heart probab i ly would have prevented his doing in a similar situation -- I aſsure you it gives me v ery great satisfaction to know that I have had it in my pow er to oblige him -- & am agreeably flattered by the warmth of his Acknowledgments -- I shall write to him again very soon for perhaps it may be neceſsary for him to have ye- money for a short time -- The Major & I breakfasted with Sacville who sets out to day for Teignmouth -- Sir Robt . meets him there & goes in a few days to Paris -- Mr. S . said he had proposed to Sir R . to accompany him , instead of Ly H . , but h e di d not consent to it -- If Ld .
