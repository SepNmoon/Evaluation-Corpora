Curzon Street -- Jany . 12 -- 1790 -- Both your last Letters , my dear Mrs Dickinson , have been round to Wherwell , in vain , & have followed me to Town , where we came very succeſsfully near a month ago ; And because I had two or three things to enclose to you , I have been waiting for a Frank all this time , expecting my Uncle to return to London . However as He is not immediately coming , I will not delay any further , & this shall travel to Him at Uppark for his Signature . -- My Father still continues Mr- Dickinson 's Prescription with great Constancy , & imputes much of his relief to it , tho Rhumatic Twinges & Spasms will return & remind him during this damp weather . -- He is still so helpleſs as not to have the power of lifting his Leg off the Bed , or of rising from his Chair without the aſsistance of one man & a crutch ; but all the Medical People persist in promising a certain Recovery , tho a slow one , & nothing now has been recommended or applied since He came to Town , except a Bandage . His Health is unimpaired & his Spirits rather better . -- Mr- Watkin attends Mrs- Iremonger every Day , but not with so much benefit as we had hoped , tho her Eyes are certainly materially better than they were in the Country . She has gone thro̅ much Discipline in Blisters , but she has Relapses of the Complaint . Mrs- Iremonger does not trust herself to read or write & therefore it was very considerate in You not to put her under the temptation of answering a Letter from you . We all write in most heartily congratulating you & Mr- J. Dickinson on the instance you tell me of , of his Father 's affectionate generosity in putting him in present poſeſsion of Taxal Estate . I can easily imagine the great agrément it must be to you ; & the Sensations of such a good Parent on this Occasion will be their own Reward . If I should ever be carried into your Neighborhood , I would inquire You out . A Cottage in such a Situation , as I have heard You describe Your 's , would be my delight . The use of the Buxton Baths is sometimes urged to my Father as what He would find an effectual Restorative , & I believe Your Abode is not very distant from thence ; But I doubt it is very unlikely we should go , my Father has no little pleasure in any other Place except Wherwell . -- Mrs- Walsingham has indeed had a very tedious , & we suspect an alarming Illneſs . It is given out as a Rhumatic fever , & that Dr- Warren has all along aſsur 'd there was no danger ; But two other Conjectures have spread , the Insanity which you mention , & an idea of something of a Scrophulous Nature in the arm . The latter is more believed than the former because only a Surgeon & Dr- Warren attend ; & an Old Apothecary whom Mrs- Wal : has employed these 20 Years is not suffered to enter the House . Miſs Boyle never quits her Mother 's room , & is every way much to be pitied . Mrs- Iremonger was admitted to her once , & found her divided between Hope & Fear , but she did not enter into particulars . Lately , our Daily answers to Enquiries have said that She was mending , & in a fair way . Yesterday It was altered again , to expreſs that She continued without alteration . Mrs- Montague was here one evening , lively & well , & full of the Entertainments She was going to give to the French Ladies . The Young Montagues have three Children , but Mrs- I—— can not fix the date of arrival of the last , we have a notion it was lately . -- I thank You very much for the Key to the Quipos , & I shall not fail to send it to my friend Louisa Shipley who is still at Weymouth with her Mother ; but I expect her within a few weeks in Town . She has not been so well again since this series of damp weather . -- How good You are , & Mr- Dickinson too to remember my Friend , & my Stomach too so kindly ! I have lately been remarkably well , more free from Heartburn & it 's attendants than for several Years ; owing I think to a twelvemonth 's perseverence in Lua & seltzer Water . If Mr- Dickinson wants to grow Strong , & has a confidence in my Skill , I am sure I owe him some advice , & am to give it whenever He likes to apply . -- Your friend Miſs Gunning is married , & from your account , & every other , has a good prospect for permanent Happineſs ; Not so , poor Lady Mornington 's Daughter , Lady Anne Fitzroy , now ; He is Lord Southampton 's 3 d . Son , & they can not have quite £400 p ann . between them , & worse than all , He is said to be a mauvais Sujet . -- The Duke & Duch : of Dorset have been a week at Knowle , entertaining 200 Poor People every day in their Hall ; the best sort of Féte , & a fine example . -- London is full of French Fugitives , among the rest Madame De Boufleurs , Mistreſs to the Prince de Conti , the Ducheſse de Beron & many more . The Duc d'Orlean 's has bro't over with him Madame de Buffon , Daughter in law to the great Naturalist ; It is said that the Prince of Wales has made her great offers , but She treated him with Contempt . We lead a quiet Country life in Curzon Street . Mrs- & Miſs Pitt come to us every evening . Mrs- Carter dined with us yesterday , & suffered much Rhumatic Pain in her arm . The Vellum Writing Paper , which you advised I bought at Bristol , where they are famous for making it . Little Catharine grows monstrously fast , has just now got a Sneezing Cold , otherwise very well . She sends Love to your Louisa , & remembers her perfectly . I sincerely wish You many happy returns of the 26 th . of Janry . And I remain Dear Mrs- Dickinson , Yrs- Sincerely obliged & Affectionately E.
