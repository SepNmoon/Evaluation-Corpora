London . Nov . 12 th : 1807 . By return of Post , my dearest Cousin , I sincerely thank you and Mr : Dickenson , for your extreme kindneſs ; by which , at a future period , I dare say , I may be able to profit ; but , after what I have told you , I have no hesitation in avowing , that I am now in a very uneasy suspense , and correspondence with Mr : Holman , relative to material pecuniary concerns ; till the arrangement of which , I am unable to decide what to do for the best : of course , our consultations would be ineffective till I have received my answer upon this subject ; and I am likewise , in the act of collecting together , whatever little matters I can call my own from our place in Herefordshire , such as Books , & c. & c. -- I believe I omitted in my last , telling you the only good there is to tell , about me : namely , that , by the affection and generosity of my dear Father , I shall at a future ( I hope a distant ) period , be out of the reach of pecuniary embarraſsment . He has purchased an Annuity for me , which , at his decease , will be vested in the hands of Trustees , for my exclusive use . For the present , my Income must be contracted ; but if Mr : H . behave as he ought , ( of which I grieve to say , in the present fatal delusion that poſseſses him , I have my doubts ) I might live upon it with comfort , upon the moderate scale that would content me . You may judge of my present state of mind . It is no small proof of your friendship that you wish to encounter my company ; for even my singing , which used to help out a little , is , by grief and illness , extinct : whether it will return , depends , I suppose , on whether things go on so as to allow me any peace of mind . I hope to Heaven I shall not be involved in any dispute with Mr : H . , as to what is my due . Though his conduct is certainly very blamable , I can not help retaining such an affection for him , as would render his putting himself still more in the wrong , a serious grief to me . I ought to have had some account before now , from him , on this point : I suppose he can not long delay it ; and when I know what I am to expect , you shall hear from me again , my dear Cousin . So rumours had reached you : they have , by what I now understand , been long on foot ; but I was wilfully slow of belief . How could one credit ill reports of a man who had for so long a period , behaved with the utmost affection and kindneſs ? I believe the weakneſs and inconstancy of human nature , would be an endleſs disquisition ; so , I will not enter upon it here . I will add a repetition of the extreme obligation I feel , to you and Mr : Dickenson ; with my kindest love to him , and my Cousin Louisa . I hope your health is perfectly re-established . I am engaged in a correspondence of consultation , with my Father . I have no expectation of him in town , immediately , on account of the season . Besides , as I said before , I am by no means certain that he will remove at all . He has shewn me the greatest kindneſs . I am very glad I wrote to you before you finished your last ; lest you should not have been convinced that I should have written independently . Adieu , my dear Cousin -- believe me your most obliged & affectionate Jane Holman . It is needleſs , I hope , to say , how happy I shall be , to see you all , when I am able .
