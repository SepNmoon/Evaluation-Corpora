Sepbr . -- permit me after this little preface to point out to you that your expreſsions in return were much warmer than the Subject required deserved , & made me feel for a few moments that I had done wrong -- as ye . first wish of my heart at present is that you should labour under no mistake respecting me , know I never will encourage you to expreſs any other term than friend -- nay more if my friendship is any satisfaction to you , know that by so doing you hazard the discontinuance of the appearance in every shape of it from me -- I never , Never , Never will have any thing to reproach my self with on your account -- you are young , a few Years hence you will upon retrospection acknowledge that that I asked not only a just but friendly part -- I shall ever preserve your friendship -- I never will accept or listen to more -- The friendship I profeſs is not a mere Miſses friendship -- flattery & compliment on your side will ever be displeasing , because I am so perfectly well acquainted wth . myself -- I boast not of this merit -- because I owe to Parents who early taught me to feel & know ye . defects both of my person & mind -- The former , between real friends is of no consequence & can have little no influence -- but I own it hurts me when any one attempts to impose upon me by unmeaning & unjust compliment on either I have endeavoured to execute your little commiſsion what ever faults there are excuse them it is ye . first I have done I do not promise ye . Purse soon -- as I have a great deal of work on my hands for ye . Queen & c & c
