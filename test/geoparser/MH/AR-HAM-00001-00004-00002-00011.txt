Dear Sir , I lose no time in returning you thanks for your letter from Taxal of the 1 st . of Novr . which I only received this morning . I am obliged to you for the offer of leaving your Thousand Pounds in my hands upon the security proposed & at 5 pr.Ct . for leſs interest I never cou 'd have thought of offering you . I had rather be your Debtor than almost any other man 's & if I can be off taking the money from Scotland , which my Agent gave me reason to expect towards the middle of this month , I certainly will , & I have already wrote a letter from to my Agent signifying my inclination , but at the same time expreſsing my abhorrence from doing any thing unhandsome by any Person who may be engaged to him to furnish the money . I have desir 'd an immediate answer for your satisfaction . If it shou 'd fortunately turn out that I may be at liberty to keep your money , the Interest of course commenc 'd from the day the Bill was sent from Manchester , the Heretable Bond shall be made in your name & when you come to Town I will also give you a collateral Bond of Security upon my personal Property . The Interest shall be paid punctually every six months at Mr. Hammersley 's in Pall Mall without the necessity of applying to me , so far for the money , the favor I know not how to repay . I am happy to hear your Father has acted so generously by you , this certainly implies that he is conscious that he has a deserving Son . I beg you & Mrs. Dickenson will accept the best Compts of all my Family , be aſsured we shall be very glad of seeing you in the Spring . The Cornet is very happy & is to join his Regiment in February , which is to relieve the Regt . of light Dragoons now in attendance upon the King in the Month of May next , soon after which it will be review 'd ; we are labouring hard at the drill both on foot & on horseback & I really think I shall send a very good recruit to the Regiment , his form is very good being upwards of 5 feet 9 Inches with the countenance of a Gentleman . He is already in poſseſsion of a very fine Horse , which the Riding Master expects will turn out well if he shou 'd the sole credit of him will be mine Adieu My Dear Sir , believe me ever Your faithful & Obliged Hum ble Serv Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street . 249 November 6 th . 1789 .
