Dearest dearest dearest Friend , The World says that impudence is the Soldier 's Cockade . From what paſsed this Afternoon I should fancy that you must think that I have more than usually falls to ye . ſhare of any man when I perceived how much ſtruck and astonished you was with my ſudden appearance , I was then obliged to say something which might explain to any By stander , why & wherefore I ſpoke to you at so unusual a place , & at so unusual an hour , but believe me I never I never make use of that selfsame impudence , but to draw some friend or other out of blame . Have not you notwithstanding all yr . promises yet placed so much confidence in him whom you honor with the name of Friend as to believe that he never will do any thing which he thinks can be hurtful in the ſmallest degree , either privately or in the eyes of the World , to yr . honor , or reputation . Last night when I proposed to you to meet me in the Garden I intended nothing else , but to ſatisfy myself concerning the State of yr . health , whether yr . pain yr . ſide was better or not I had the same intention to Night , but the moment I perceived your dear face overſpread with a Blush , I immediately retired never wishing to give you an instant 's pain , by any of my actions or expreſsions , I only wish my dearest Friend by this aſsurance to convince you that I may am worthy of that confidence from you , which I have placed in you . Adieu , for the present , I have written this in the greatest hurry , & believe me that I shall l during love and esteem you as more than any friend , during the whole of my life . 7 th .
