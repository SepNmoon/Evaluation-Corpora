Tunbridge Wells 19 July 1782 -- my Dear Miſs Hamilton , You will be surprised , by a letter from the Mountains of Ephraim ; & I daresay will not scruple paying postage , tho ' it came from the promised land ; as you are always too so anxious to hear from your friends : tho ' I ought to apologise for intruding on your time , unleſs there was something worth amusing with . We arrived here the 10 th , since which time the weather has had a tersian Ague , and continualy spoils our prospect of the hay making which is a beautifull scene interspersed on the Hills all round . We have a comfortable House ( for this place ) on the top of Mount Ephraim stone inside as well as out : for the owners have thought it too fine to hide in the parlours with any thing more than a little paint -- the floors partake of the Hilly situation , so that in the center of the room , we can sit or walk on the slope -- the outside is as singular as the in ; having no top , or roof : it apears very odd but as we have had very heavy rain and found ourselves safe from the storm have been satisfied we are well secured , tho ' it makes no figure -- the Hill is all interspersed with Lumps of rock among which are squeezed little cottages & Hovels which form a picturesque view , and at the Bottom we look over the Well , Mount Sion , Mount Pleasant -- & c & c to talk to you of views is rather presumptious who walk the Terrace and commend that beautifull one of the Thames & c but should be glad to raise your curiosity to come and see it , as well as Les Roché tout proche ; which are so celebrated ; we would give you , a comfortable room and sincere welcome , perhaps , a little Tunbridge Water , might be good for your nerves ! my Mother was very weak when we came , and has already found great Benefit from them , and the Air ; which is allowed to be very fine . We flatter ourselves she will return so recruited and stout that you will be quite pleased at the improvement -- here is a great deal of company , Lady Morton , Ly . Mary Bowlby , Ly . Darnley , Ly . Robert Manners , Ly . Bows , Heathcote , Grosvenor , Lord & Lady Parker but they go very soon , Mrs. John Pitt & daughter , Mrs Wyndham , Nisbett . & c will tell you no more that you may have a curiosity to come and see , particularly our Beaus , that I wont say any thing about till you come here are some great Cheſs Players also Dtr : DBowdler who belongs to Count Bhruhl s club , Mr. Aufrere & c & c -- the Phisician we left here two years ago Dtr : Wright has left the Place , and tis said his practice , in order to enter the line of matrimony with Mrs. Gray , who perhaps you know something of : She was Maid of Honour to the Late Princeſs of Orange and Sister of Sir James Gray : her Mother who is lately Dead near 100 was always against the match and her daught er tho ' near or quite 70 was too dutifull to dispose of herself , but that obstacle being removed 't is expected to take place very soon -- have you heard of Lady Hamilton yet ? Lady Morton complains of the loss of Letters sadly , and as Prince Caramanico Lays abed all day he is of little use to employ about sending them more safely -- I hope now we are removed so far asunder you will find time to send me a few lines to say how you do and whether you aprove our hint of a trip to Tunbridge I hope the news story about Prince William is like most other false , and that you and all the R . Familly are quite well -- my Sister is but indifferent and has not been out since here , so only my Ly . & I have attended the tea drin gs ki ngs and Pantiles ; the Balls are but just began & we have not exhibited there as yet -- My Mother and Sister Joyn with me in best wishes and in hopes of a few lines to tell me these were acceptable I remain my Dear Miſs Hamilton Yours Sincerely Wil : King Miſs Hamilton Queens Lodge Windsor a single sheet
