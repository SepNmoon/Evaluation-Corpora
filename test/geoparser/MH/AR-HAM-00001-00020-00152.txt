28 , S t . Albans Street 30 th . June 1800 . My Dear Sister , Your Letter , & Note to Mr. Benn , arrived safe this Morning . The former I put in my pocket , and threw the latter into the fire place after having carefully torn it . I had two excellent reasons for doing so . In the first place , to save my Man s Shoe Leather , and in the second place , I had presented my Wife with Hannah More 's Book , many many Months ago . Of all this , I proposed to inform You when I got home . But , your Puppy of a Bookseller has been too alert , for on my return to my Lodgings this Evening , I found a packet on the Table , directed for Me . On opening it , Hannah More , Mrs- Chapone , with Mrs- Dickenson s Compliments stared me in the face . This , is really very provoking , that I am to be molested carrying female Nonsense , up & down the Country . As , however , the Books are well bound , perhaps , they may be civilly received by my Females , & therefore , if my Man John will condescend to trouble himself with taking charge of them , I will not throw them out of the Chaise Window . Love to your Husband and Daughter . AÅ¿sure Yourself of my constant abhorrence , for I hate all Givers of Presents , out of Envy , perhaps , that I can not afford to follow the example . Adieu My Dear Sister . Ever Your sincere & Affectionate Friend Napier London , First July 1800 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Napier .
