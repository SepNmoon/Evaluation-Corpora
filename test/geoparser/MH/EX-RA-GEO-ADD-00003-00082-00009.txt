½ past 8 Sunday Morning 27 th June 1779 -- My dearest dearest dearest Friend , You say that I only fancy I wish for yr . friendſhip , believe me I am not of so weak or so changeable a disposition , I desire it more than any other earthly thing , I entreat of you to grant it me . I flatter myſelf that the confidence you have hitherto placed in me , you have not found misplaced . And I thought I told you in my last Letter that that person who was once My friend , always remained so . And I am thoroughly convinced , that I have not a more disinterested or sincere Friend , than yourself , words can not expreſs how desirous I am , that you ſhould continue so . I ſhall always reckon it one of my greatest happineſses to be looked upon & treated as a friend by you , to whom you know , nobody is more sincerely attached than I am . Adieu my most amiable Friend , & believe that there is no manner of happineſs either earthly or celestial , which you are not wished to enjoy , by yr . ever affectionate Friend . P.S . Excuse the ſhortneſs , and bad ſtyle of my Letter as I have had but an instant to write it in , however I flatter myself that it contains sentiments you will approve of . Adieu my dearest & ever dear Friend .
