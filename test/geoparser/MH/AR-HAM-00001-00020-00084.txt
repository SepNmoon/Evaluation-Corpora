From the Living to the Dead . N o . 1 Edinr- 16 Decr- 1783 My Dear Sister , I have for these last four Months been in constant expectation of receiving a packet from the Dominions of Pluto whither I presume You have for some time taken up your abode , but on recollecting that it is customary ( as Poets tell ) for those who inhabit the Infernal Regions to drink large draughts of the Water of Lethe , there may be a poſsibility that Your plentiful potations of that water have entirely obliterated any faint remembrance of your once having had a Brother . I have more than once debated with myself on the propriety of recalling that idea to your recollection , & have at last determined to do so , as it will only be putting You to the trouble of swallowing one extraordinary Cup , to drown whatever thoughts may be unpleasing to You -- Last September I dispatched a letter to You dated Balgowan , since which time I have neither heard from or of You . I have daily examined the List of Marriages & Deaths but have been unsucceſsfull in every attempt to account for your Silence . Peace be with You . May your Repose be undisturbed . Best respects to all your Brother & Sister Devils . Ever your sincere friend and Affectionate Brother Napier .
