Septr . 7 th . 1779 Tuesday Morng . My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister Friend , Allow me to thank you for ye . kind present you was so good as to make me in giving me that little Book , such little marks of friendship especially when they convey such good advice are infinitely more pleasing than great presents where frequently nothing but oſtentation is ye . principal object . Allow me also to expreſs my gratitude for the kindneſs , attachment , & sincere affection , you say you have for me , in yr . last Letters . A mark of yr . esteem is dearer than any thing to me , & there is nothing upon Earth I wld .. not do to merit it . I hope I always ſhall and if ever I do any thing to forfit it I am sure it will be unintentionally but I hope that will never be ye . case . I know from yr . sympathising disposition & from Yr . friendſhip . you will be happy to hear that William is in perfect health , & goes on in a manner fully sufficient to answer our most sanguine desires . His Admiral , Admiral Digby I mean gives th is ac e fo llowing account of him I saw ye . Letter he wrote to ye . King about William “ He says that he thinks William “ will make a very great Sea Officer “ that his talents are surprising , that “ ye moment he ſaw they were preparing “ for action , his spirits rose to that degree “ that he was almost in a ſtate of insanity “ & that ye . moment ye . Fleets were “ separated his spirits immediately ſunk “ very low , & they did not reaſsume their “ usual ebb for some time after. ” We are now every moment to expect an invasion , the moment our Enemies the K——g & my B——r as well as myself go immediately , ye . only thought that enters into my head , totally void from ye smallest sensation of fear , is that perhaps when I take leave of you it will be for ye . last time , if that is ye . case Let Friendship 's faithful heart attend my bier Heave ye . sad sigh , & drop ye . pitying tear . Plutarch 's Lives , transl . John Langhorne & William Langhorne , 1770 . Answer of Solon 's to one of his Friends . Never talk to me of there being of yr . dying before , it is not likely my dearest Friend , for you are now come to an age , where there is not near ye . danger , that there is at mine , besides you are a Young Woman , I am a Young Man , you have none of ye . hazards , risks , & dangers young Men have to go thro ' , however whatever be ye . case never I entreat of you if you have any affection for me , mention yr . death to me , it really pains me too much . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu dearest , tenderest , delightfullest Friend , Yr . for ever attached Palemon . toujours de même P.S . I send you with this little Note a copy of Verses which I think you will not think they are bad , they are an imitation of a Copy of Verses which ye A. B—— of Y—— my late P——r composed in Latin upon ye . death of my Grandfather , they are reputed to be beautiful beyond expreſsion he left my Grandmother then with a Child of 8 Months old which was my Uncle Frederick , & 4 Month with Child , of the unfortunate Queen of Denmark . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu , toujours chère
