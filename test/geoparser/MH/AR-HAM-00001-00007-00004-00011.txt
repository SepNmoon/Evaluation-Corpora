Dear Madam In obedience to her Majesty 's commands , I have taken the Liberty of conveying to her , thro you , the enclos 'd Comments on the ten Commandments . My partiality for the Author has perhaps led me to mention this little Publication , which I fear may be deemd unworthy of royal Notice . The Author is a truly pious , parochial Clergyman : He dedicates his time in a particular manner to the Instruction of The lower Orders of Mankind , whom he considers principally to stand in need of his a≈øsistance . In his Parish he has instituted a School , which he presides over , and to which all the infant Poor are admitted . The present Work is intended for the Benefit of these little Ones . I think it by no means perfect of its kind , but Gilpin has given no Comments specifically on the Commandments , and Secker , for a thousand reasons , is ill-calculated for an infant . It was on this account I presum 'd to mention the present Performance : I shall find myself happy if it answers the expectation her Majesty may have formd from my description of it . I have the honor to be Dear Madam yr sincere Friend and obt servt John Farhill 17 th . Novbr . 1782 Kew
