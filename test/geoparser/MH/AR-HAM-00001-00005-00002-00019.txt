Park Street 21 March 1794 Your letter my Dear Friend had been long wishd for and I need not say gave me great pleasure , especiely as it raises my hopes that Bath , air , Water , and Society will very soon conquer Your complaints ; and enable You to enjoy health and friends -- I should sooner have acknowledged your kind remembrance had not my mind been too much bustled to be an agreable correspondent ; My Husband was kept wind bound , at Spithead and St. Helens ever since January , and could not obtain leave of absence ( being under Sailing Orders ) even to come to London to see his Brother , or on any buſsineſs of his own which he had plenty of -- the General poor Man growing every day weaker and Wilhelmina Murray marrying in such haste compleeted the bustle : he has made a choice that every body aproves : and makes his Sisters very happy , as the Dutcheſs bears so great a Character and is such an intimate friend of theirs that there is every reason to hope it will not only prove happineſs to the Duke but to all his familly . She is a very prety Woman and has never had any children is two and thirty so of a very proper age to be a companion to him who is 39 and to take charge of his daughters perhaps You have seen her and the constent atention she paid to the Duke of Atholl during his life has raised her Character very high as a Wife , and I trust she will continue to shine in that with the adition of being as good a a Mother in law -- the only thing to be aprehended is her health as she is of a very delicate construction -- I was at the Wedding Lord MacLeod , the Dutcheſs Dowager & Lady Jane John Murray Mr. Muirhead and Y . H . S . were all the Ladies the Gentlemen were Lady Mary Martin who performed the ceremony Miſs Knight Lord George Murray and Lord Tullibardine James who gave the Bride away and Edward Murray the ceremony was perfformed in the evening after which we all dispersed and the Bride and Bridegroom went out of Town to Caen-wood where they remained some days and then sett out for the North . -- Colo. Knight is still in Town and talks of returning to Bath next week -- poor Mr. Stuart we have lost , he lived till Wednesday when he died retaining his fortitude to the last -- indeed it has been a shock to my feeling He was an old friend of at least twenty Year and his death has renewed feelings I had endevor 'd to compose for the Loſs of another Brother for whom we have only quited Mourning a fortnight -- the papers amuse themselves with a 1000 lies about him all without foundation : but not worth refuting , all that were acquainted with him know his Value and those that are Strangers can have no amusement in reading pros and cons on such a subject -- We are all under the greatest anxiety , for poor Lady Jane third Sister to Gen. Murray ; she went with her Husband last Year to Jamaica , he was a Major in the Horse , and very happy in each other ; unfortunately he died of a fever last Decr . and she was left a truely disconsolate widow , without man , woman , or child belonging to her there : Lady Amelia Cooke & the Duke of Atholl the Lt . Govr . took her to their house and have treated her with every atention and kindneſs that could be in their power to bestow , or expected to be received from the known Hospitality and goodneſs of their hearts which is too well known to need any thing I can say in praise of them : but this poor Gen : was on board the William and Elizabeth , on her return home : and has met with that shocking Wreck on the Sands . We are assured no life is lost . but we are entirely in the dark what is become of her -- are in daily hopes she will arrive in some of those fortunate ships that have escaped the Danger of the Sea and that of the Enemy but till She does arrive we must be very anxious : God knows what is best for Us Blind Mortals : and We must receive these misfortunes with humility and not repine at the Bleſsings He sees fit to deprive us of ; and be very thankfull for those He is so good to continue to us -- in the midst of all this bustle , I have had the comfort of seeing my Husband return in good health at a time when by the wind I concluded he was sail 'd to Torbay -- he was sent for expreſs by the Admiralty and is now to give up the Glory , and sail very soon to a very different destination -- I am just this instent informed that poor Mrs. Williamson is safe arriv 'd at Portsmouth God grant the news may be true ! -- You will excuse this stupid letter my Dear Friend but though my Nerves have had some excercise I trust I have excerted them and shall continue to do so , in a Manner that will intitle me to a continuance of my friends aprobation and among that number my Dear Ly . Amelia give me leave to rank You I return the Clever paraphrase enclosed with many thanks have taken a copy of it as You gave me leave and in return send You a song that is very fashonable and I think very good make no doubt but You will think so too . -- pray write soon , very soon and tell me all about Yourself and La Charmante Lady Amelia Cooke Mrs. Dickenson & c & c The Commodore joyns my Sister and self in compts and every good wish to You and Yours and believe me in all situations My Dear Louisa Your Affectionate and Sincere Friend Mr. Dickenson
