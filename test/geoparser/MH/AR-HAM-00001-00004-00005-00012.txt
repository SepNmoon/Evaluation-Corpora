Caserta Janry . 28 th 1779 I hope by this time My Dear Miſs Hamilton that your Mind is a little more composed than it was when Ly Dartrey was so obliging as to write to me when I answer 'd her , I took the liberty with her to inclose a short letter to you , only to expreſs to you my Affection & the part I take in every thing which concerns you , which I flatter myself you can never doubt of -- We have been constant inhabitants of this place ever since the 13 th - of December excepting one day on which we went to Town to give a dinner to forty four English who are now at Naples , The Court ( that is the little Court consisting of one Lady in waiting , seven or eight Gentlemen of the Bedchamber , the Grand Chambellan , the Grand Veneur , & the First Minister ) are here , the rest only come occasionally -- the English are not pleas 'd that we are so distant from Naples , tho ' they have reason to be satisfied as they all come to dine with us every time they come to Caserta which is a great convenience to them as there is no Auberge which they can go to -- in the mean time Sr Wm . pays his Court & keeps his health by the great & almost constant exercise he uses , for he seldom miſses going out shooting with The King when His Majesty thinks the Sport will be good which is usually three or four times a week -- they set out at break of day dine in the field , & he comes home just to drink tea , when he returns again to the Palace where he plays at a Game called Biribis wth- the King & Queen , they afterwards sup , & he is at home by a little after nine o'clock , -- this kind of footing is a curious one for the King of England s -- Minister to one of the Bourbon family , & what makes it still more particular is that the French & Spanish Minister come but once a week in a formal way , & usually come together as if to keep one another in Countenance -- all this must appear very strange to you My Dear Miſs Hamilton -- but I do believe this is the most extraordinary Court in Europe , so full of Spanish étiquette at times , then , no étiquette at all -- the situation of the Royal family ( which you must have heard of ) at the time the poor little Hereditary Prince was taken ill & died was as extraordinary as every thing else , & I really believe he perish 'd for want of proper aſsistance , two days after his Death the Queen sent for Sr Wm . & me & we were with her near two hours during all wch . time she spoke of nothing but the little Prince & in so feeling & affecting a manner , that tho ' ( as you know ) I was aware of the changeableneſs of her Character , I yet could not refrain from tears , & was tempted to think she had then receiv 'd a blow she would never recover , especially as she was then very near lying in . -- in this Situation Her Majesty remaind for a week or ten days , at the end of which she began to get up her Spirits , & at the end of three weeks was as gay as ever & even laughing upon subjects which one would have imagined must have renew 'd her grief -- since this the Queen has lain in very happily , & is ( I believe ) intent upon nothing so much as getting the Rei n s of Government intirely in her own hands , in which scheme she makes a rapid progreſs , for The King unused to any serious application , is glad when he is tired out with Memorials , & Affairs of State to take up his Gun & leave the termination to the Queen who has sufficient Art to make him think , that she is only the instrument of fulfilling the plans he has himself laid -- her lying in has not decreas 'd her aſsiduity , & every affair of consequence has been referr 'd to her tho ' still in her Bed , where she plays at Biribis every evening , Sr Wm . desisted from going since her My . was brought to bed , but The King by the Queen s desire , told him to come & play with them as usual , so he went there last Night & is gone again this evening after Shooting from five o'clock in the Morning -- you may imagine My Dear Miſs Hamilton that I should not venture to say all this to you if My letter was to paſs thro ' the Neapolitan Post , I am in hopes of a good opportunity of sending my letter it in a few days , & this enables me to write with that freedom which I should not otherwise dare use . -- as to telling you all the trifling events which happen here ; they would tire & not interest you ; as you are not acquainted with the people concern 'd , but I must mention to you a piece of good fortune which has happen 'd to Ldy Maynard who with her Lord is return 'd to make another attempt to get into company , a Prince Marsico a favourite of The King s was taken with a violent putrid fever & given over by the Physicians , Sr. Wm . mention 'd James 's powder to His Majesty & he desired him to give him some with the directions how to use it -- Sr Wm . did so , & The King gave it to the Lady in waiting to send it to Naples for Prince Marsico -- The Lady in waiting either lost or forgot it but it was accidentally known in Naples that The King intended the Prince should take it upon which Ld Maynard flew to Prince Marsico 's Palace & notwithstanding repeated denials insisted upon admittance , tired with resisting , they at length allowed him to come into the Sick room where He found the Patient convuls 'd & Senseleſs , & the Doctors aſsuring he had not more than three hours to live , -- he then propos 'd the powder which they refus 'd to give saying it would kill him sooner , Ld Maynard then took it upon himself , gave the powder with succeſs , & after a very few hours the Prince Marsico was out of danger -- the Pignatellis ( of whom he is one ) full of gratitude immediately went & visited Ly Maynard & I am told they intend to ask the Queen to receive her at Court as the best return for the obligation they are under to Ld Maynard but it is very doubtfull if Her Majesty who knows ( tho ' not from Sr Wm . or me ) her former life will , or can receive her , especially as she was so publickly here with the D. of Dorset , let it be as it will , I am quite easy about it , as it is not poſsible for me to be the channel made use of , & therefore neither Sr Wm . or myself have any thing to answer for -- The Princeſs Belmonte Sister in Law to Count Pignatelli Minister in England wrote to me to ask my permiſsion to take notice of Ly Maynard who she said had paid great Court to her ( her letter is curious & was it not too long I would send it you ) to this I answer 'd that I beg 'd she would follow her inclination , as no civility Ly Maynard receiv 'd could ever give me the smallest displeasure , & I think it is very likely she will be well receiv 'd by some of the Ladies here as I hear she has been clever enough to make them many presents a method which has great weight with this Country . in the mean time I am much satisfied with being at this distance from the Capital having time here for many occupations which are perpetually interrupted when I am at Naples , the greatest inconvenience I feel is , that constant application sometimes hurts my eyes & forces me to lay down a book often at the most interesting paſsage which when one is alone is a real mortification -- at these moments I can not help sending a wish towards England , & thinking how happy we should be to be quietly & comfortably settled there , but I drive away the thought , as I do not see at present any likelihood of our meeting with such a piece of good fortune . -- both Sr Wm . and I are happy in the idea of your situation My Dr Miſs Hamilton -- your good sense teaches you to prize it & I see with pleasure ( by your last letter ) how full of love & gratitude your heart is to tThe Queen for h H er great goodneſs to you -- What a difference between Our Queen & other Queens ! -- j'en suis temoin -- if ever you have a good Opportunity I desire you will say every thing that is dutifull & respectfull both from Sr. Wm . & me to Her Majesty , & you may do it with a good Grace for we really feel it -- I hope I shall hear from you very soon & let me know how all the young Princes & Princeſses do : & particularly the beautifull little Prince Adolphus -- tell me if he is as handsome as ever -- Sr Wm . joins with me in kind love & I am My Dr . Miſs Hamilton Yr very Affectionate Aunt CHamilton I hope you go to see Ly Stormont sometimes , I had a letter from her some days ago which pleas 'd me much , as it seem 'd to expreſs great family happineſs , & a perfect regard , friendship & esteem for Ld Stormont --
