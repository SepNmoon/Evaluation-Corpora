I was favour 'd with my Dear Mr Browne s second Letter late last night I should have answerd yr first imeditly but was so very Ill at the time I was incapable of Writeing Your Second Letter schocked me greatly at the same time alow me to hope every thing may yet be Setled aimicably & to yr Wish I sent imeditly on the Receipt of yours to Miſs Hamilton Written to the Signet at his House in Argyle Square with an Intention to delliver yr Meſsage but he is out of Town ( & they say ) does not return for some days but as at present no Court of Law is sitting it makes his comeing rather precotious . for which reason you should get Mr Charles Browne s Man of Law to write to him yr orders as they understand one another 's stille better than ones unacquainted with these things ; consequently are fittest to be employ 'd in all Law affairs -- but you had best lose no time . Mrs Hamilton & you do me but justice in bellieveing me yr very Sinceare friend & that I most heartily Sympathize with you both ! excuse a short Letter I realy am very Ill but much yours : do write as often & fully as you please it will ever be Agreeable -- Accept Mrs Hamilton s & the Young folk s best wishes for yourself & Mr Napier as well as those of your ever Affect & c & c & c & c Mrs Hamilton I hope soon to hear that both yr Mamma & you are better
