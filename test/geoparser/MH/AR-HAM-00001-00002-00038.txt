Holbrooke Wed : Morg 1 st . April 1795 My dearest Mary I came here a little past four yesterday & had a very friendly reception -- & had the pleasure of finding Mrs. B . quite well -- & her fine Boy -- On Monday we walked out at ten OClock Mr Birch went to Lathkill & I staid in Bakewell Meadows where I fished till half past three -- the old pract it ioner shewed me how to throw the line & I very soon caught hold of a fish at which I g i ve a strong pluck -- the man rubbed his hands & laughed heartily to see so great a fool & said if the fish had kept his hold I shd . have thrown him as high out of the Water as Bakewell Steeple -- I improved upon the hint & ( to make short of my story ) , caught in a capital Style fifteen fish -- ten Graylings -- two trouts & three Salmon trouts -- 9 were takable fish & 6 were returned to the Stream . with proper admonitions & friendly advice not to trust too much to appear ance , We dined at 4 -- 6 were invited , 5 red hot Democrats & we played at Cards till past eleven -- Tuesday after breakfast I called upon Mr Mander , one of yesterdays party to see a small collection of Medals & Coins -- his father was an Antiquary -- unluckily he was called out upon busineſs & I only saw him for 5 minutes but I looked over his collection but had not time enough to examine them as Birch had promised to attend me to Rowter at a certain hour , so I returned & we set off but unluckily when we got to Haddon the rain came on -- he returned to Bakewell & I jogged on to Matlock -- I gave up seeing the druidical temple till another time -- I was very much affronted that no credit was given to my Succeſs in fishing as every body asked me how many Whi had hooked for me & of course how many the Baby brought out of the Water -- I was also flattered to find by a general Acknowledgment that there had not been so succeſsful a Coup d'eſsai known th ere -- I met Kershaw fishing there -- this puts me in mind that my Arm aches grievously still -- Miſs Pretty face is going to Derby at 9 OClock & will take this letter which you will have tomorrow -- Bradshaw tells me there was a p air of hawks sold in this Neighborhood a short time since tha t wd . have suited my father exactly -- I must dreſs & go down to Breakfast Therefore good morrow to yr night Cap God bleſs you ma tres chere Votre J.D—— -- Love to Louisa & c -- Mrs. Dickenson Birch Hall Manchester
