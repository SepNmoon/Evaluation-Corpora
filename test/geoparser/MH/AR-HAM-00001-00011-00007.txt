Clifton Sat June 9 th : My Dearest Miſs Hamilton I recd : your Letter this Morng : as I was just going into the Coach -- & during my airing , as you may easily imagine ; I thought of little else than the Contents of it . I hasten to send you an answer -- tho ' I am distreſsed to know what to say . I am grieved to hear you have been ill , & that you think your health may materially suffer by the continuance in your Place -- it hurts me to think this , on many accounts -- and it is so strong a Plea , that were you sure of them it I could bring no Argument against it -- but surely my Dear , a Month or two -- provided you recover yr : health , as I trust you will , can make no difference ; & I should be sadly grieved to have you mention your Scheme during Dr . Ly : C. Finch s absence ; or at least 'till something is settled on her account in case her bad state of health may hinder her return . -- do my dr : consider of it . for it would grieve my very heart to have you do any thing that should have the appearance of ingratitude to the the Q . as of unkindneſs to Ly : Cha . & you know -- what a difference it may be to her , to find another in your Place -- besides the great distreſs it may be to the Q . to have a new Person put in , whilst Ly : Cha . is absent -- do my dr : Friend let me beg of you to postpone yr.- Scheme of writing 'till Ly : Cha 's return , or at least as I said before , till we know how She will be obliged to act -- unleſs you are really so ill ( wh : I trust you are not , ) to make it impoſsible for you to attend without risk to yr.- Constitution -- if Docr : Turton who is yr : Friend ; & as well as Physician , thinks you really can not attend this Summer with out this hazard -- I can say no more -- & I am sure were I not your Friend , & loved you disinterestedly I should I not giv e this advice -- when I might enjoy so much more of your Company & conversation by yr : giving up yr : Place -- I am now writing in haste -- the Dinner is on the Table -- & soon after Dinner I expect Mrs : Quin & her Son -- but I know you will excuse every thing -- & be aſsured -- I advice this on yr : account -- Yrs : ever PD let me hear from you I beg -- for I shall be anxious to know what you do . -- whatever it is ; I am sure it will be upon principle -- but I do hope -- you will upon mature consideration p os tpone speaking ; -- & when you & I meet ; we will settle according as affairs turn out by that time I mean respecting our Dr : Ly : C . & 'till then provided you are pretty well ; surely you can go on -- The Q -- if you are Ill , must see it is impoſsible for you , to attend ; & I should think you might tell her ; ( as She has always behaved in so very kind & friendly a manner to you ) that you are unhappy at not being able to do your duty & I fear you must be obliged to give up your Place : -- but you know all this better than I can . -- I wish with all my heart I was with you -- I could talk to you so much better than I can write -- do pray consider well before you write ; & I do for many reasons wish you could put off yr : Scheme till next Winter I writ to you last post & sent it directed to the Queen 's Lodge Windsor I imagined you were there . pray tell me if the Q said any thing about me after she sent for me -- I was at the moment going to have my Tooth drawn wch : I was quite sorry for -- as I wished very particularly to be able to go -- Pray write to me soon & enquire for the Letter I sent to you to Windsor To Miſs Hamilton S t : James 's palace London
