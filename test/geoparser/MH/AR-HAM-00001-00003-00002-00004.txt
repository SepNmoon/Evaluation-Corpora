Naples March 20 th 1804 My Dear Sister If paper were capable of blushing , I shou 'd not venture to appear thus in your presence , after a Silence , wch : I am well aware must carry the appearance of neglect , & a positive omiſsion of what I confeſs was an absolute duty ; & so conscious I am of my fault , that I shall not attempt to vindicate myself , nor add to this my trangreſsion by a tedious apology : but at the same time that I have so much to lament the fatality of the various combinations wch : have tended constantly to render me thus culpable in your eyes , so in justice to my good intentions , I must beg leave just to mention them . After receiving a kind letter from you & my Brother the beginning of last year , when I was about to reply to so many obliging expreſsions of affection & c , My Louisa began of the small-pox , wch : she had in so violent a manner at the beginning as to require the strictest attendance from me , besides the state of anxiety wch : you may imagine I must suffer for the other three children , who all broke out at the same time ; & as Servants are of no use here on such occasions , you may have some very slight idea of the life I led ; tho ' I had so much reason to be thankful that the disease was so mild , as rarely falls to the lot of the offspring of Italian Parents These busy occupations were succeded by a most tedious & uncomfortable state , wch : for the first months never fails to render me incapable of any application whatever ; as a proof of this a letter began to my Sister , when the children fell sick , in the month of Feby : was finish 'd in the month of June : to this succeeded the news of the war , wch : then precluded all hope of letters going safe : I sent my letter by a round about method to our Dear Sarah , to whom I added a positive injunction which was rather unbecoming from me , to plead my excuse with you , wch : she tells me she transcrib 'd verbatim Having the favorable occasion of a private hand to carry this to Manchester , I hasten to embrace such an opportunity & to show you how much I am desirous to repair this my former omiſsion , I lose not a moment 's time to take up my pen , a week before the time , for fear of some other unlucky impediment , which I have the greater reason to fear as this very morning my eldest boy is , I believe , broke out of the Measles : two of the children have had that disorder , but as the number is now encreas 'd to five so the two youngest now have the risk very near them . I have here again to confeſs that I ought to have written sooner , to inform you of my having had another most unexpected & , almost , unwelcome increase to my cares in the latter end of November ; but I had a tedious confinement on acct : of the severity of the weather at that time ; but tho I have not yet ventur 'd out , I have the pleasure to say that I have perfectly recover 'd my Strength , & flesh , wch : is a surprising proof at the fineneſs & salubrity of the air I live in , & it is very rare to see a Nurse in a plump state , at the same time that her charge comes on so well as mine does this last is indeed one of the finest ever seen , & is a fat strong , merry little girl , insomuch that before she attaind the age of three Months , she sometimes stood upright , by holding her under one arm only ; tho we have given her the name of a Queen ( Henrietta ) she looks like a good farmers wife who lives on milk & butter She is however extremely well proportion 'd ; her greatest beauty at present , is a lovely mouth , & good eyes , with a handsome forehead ; the rest we must leave to time , which refines & perfections all things . If I fill up this my letter with an account of my olive-branches , you must attribute it not to a foolish mother 's fondneſs , which I am not conscious of having , but as I believe it the most innocent subject I can touch upon , & the most interesting one to affectionate Relations I sometimes mention them to our Dear Sarah , notwithstanding she gives herself many old-maidish airs on the occasion , & is very saucy , but I give her full credit for the enjoyment she boasts of in being free from matronly cares as I shou 'd have done the same in her case ; but as it has pleasd Almighty God to bestow so many of what are generally call 'd bleſsings on me , so I must in gratitude be thankful for what estimable qualities , either of body or mind , which I flatter myself they poſseſs . You , My Dear Sister , as a tender Mother , naturally think as I do : besides in your letter you seem to wish for a better acquaintance with your little Nephews & Nieces , which I had promis 'd myself the pleasure of giving you , had not so many impediments occurr 'd ; & I shou 'd have been particularly induc 'd to do so , as you at the same time , flatterd me with the hope of recieving a long letter from my sweet Louisa ; to whom I feel to have a more particular claim than that of a mere aunt : My affection for her was foster 'd before I had children of my own , & has ever since been kept up with a most kindly warmth by the accounts I have receiv 'd of her amiable disposition & manners , so that I feel proud of having her at least for my niece : & I coud much wish that her name sake & God-daughter might ever be brought to resemble her : She is of a very different temper to manage , wch : may be attributed to the great quantity of bile with which she abounds , which makes her discontent & c ; as she was born on the first of April so I need only say that she resembles that capricious month so her affectns & naturally tender feelings beam forth midst showers & hail-storms : under proper management , & with a better example than I can afford her , she might be corrected & induc 'd to apply ; -- as she by no means wants abilities ; on the contrary , her ideas are quick , & much clearer than those of her eldest Brother , & her hands seem form 'd for every thing ingenious & elegant : she is , at present , the plainest of the whole flock but will I believe have a good figure . John-Vint . is rather too delicate for a boy , but begins to look more manly ; he poſseſses too general abilities to excell in anything particularly ; & has no applicat ion for what requires reflection , or study : whatever he does , must be frank & natural which I think are proofs of genius ; he is very mechanical & clever in imitating what he sees , but has , alaſs ! few objects whereon to exercise his ingenuity William is a very difft : character from the others ; he promises to be solid & systematical ; is a fine stout Boy , with large Dark eyes , & features , but tho ' 5 years & half , he has yet all the simplicity & innocence of a younger child he cries about the smallest trifle , & thunders terribly in my ears , wch : I 'm sure will make you smile , as you know how little I can bear noise . As for the sweet little poppet Aurelia , I must reserve a description of her perfections for some future period , as it wou 'd require a whole foglio to make you acquainted with all the variety of her engaging qualities , & beauties : she is the idol of us all , & every thing a mother can wish they are all too much indulged , more by the Chevr : than myself , as he is too tender a Father . I was happy to hear lately a good acct : from Birch-Hall . I know your generous heart will rejoice to find th at poor Mrs : M . has left me such a handsome legacy : I was much shock 'd to hear of her melancholy death , as she was always very good to me . Pray give my best love to my Bror : & sweet Louisa . I shou 'd be very proud of a long letter from her : letters come now very safe & cheap thro ' Germany .
