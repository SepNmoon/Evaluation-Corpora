Edinr- 29 th : July 1779 My poor little Jane continues still in the most melancholy situation , so much so as to make us almost wish for her diſsolution . I had hopes of hearing from you before this , but as you did not think proper to gratify my wish & as I had procured some franks from Genl- Skene I determined to be Gracious and to favor you with a Mark of my Condescencion -- In fact , it is raining as hard as it can pour , & I am left by myself ( Harriot remaining constantly with Jane at Gayfield ) & very much inclined to be idle , I e'en begun to dirty my paper to fill up the time 'till Supper . I have been meditating upon the State of the Nation for some hours past and am perfectly satisfied that matters will not mend till his M—y fixes upon Men of merit tel que moi , & employ s them , not suffering them to loiter in idleneſs & disregard -- I am out of all patience & if I could afford it , would resign my Commission to have the satisfaction of thrashing Ld . Am—st , who while he aſsures me in writing , of the happineſs he should feel from having an opportunity of serving me , takes not the least Notice of me when there is no leſs than Thirteen new Regts- to be raised in England -- nay further , one of the Youngest Ensigns in the same Regt- with me is to have a Lieutenancy for three days merely to entitle him to a Captain Lieuty- in one of the new Corps . I wish I was with You to receive a little comfort & consolation . It is a happy thing to be independant , but as it is not my Lot to be so , I must e'er jog on the best way I can . Pray how do can you conceive it poſsible for me to paſs two Years of probation , particularly as the liberty of Speech is not granted me . You miſses are strange creatures & fully more unreasonable than we Masters . In your last letter forsooth , you approve of my choice but blame my impatience -- I fancy you have been reading Pembrokes Arcadia lately & dream of nothing but the wonderful atcheivements & dreadful exploits performed by the Heroe 's to entitle them to the regard of a Coy Damsel who rides upon a white palfrey . However I intend to behave as well as I can . Pray what do you think of Cathcart s marriage ? Beauty the Lady certainly has , not on both sides there seems to be a prodigious scarcity of the one thing needfull . That Money is a confounded thing , & still there is no doing without it . I wish him happy and he may be so if he will but begin to think , a faculty he had made little use of for some time past . Do you ever see his brother Charles ? what is he about ? he never writes to me . There is no accounting for many of the actions in my life , nor can I discover but by what means I contrived to make a Confidante of your Ladyship . Some people would be apt to say like draws to like , but that would be paying you too high a Compliment . Adieu for Supper is ready . Yours Sincerely N— After Supper . I have just taken the trouble to read over the pretty Scrawl contained upon this page & another full Sheet . If you have patience to read it , 't will be a proof of your perseverance at least ; but you must excuse my flights -- A man must some times give vent to his folly , and upon those occasions a friend ( if he has one ) is doomed to bear with his impertinence . I now find myself inclined to be serious , and could write a Sheet or two more , but having sufficiently exercised your patience already , I shall conclude by aſsuring You that I am & ever shall be Sincerely Your Affectionate friend Napier . I sent Mrs- Hunter the Lockit long ago & am astonished at her having neglected to thank you for it -- Miſs Hamilton
