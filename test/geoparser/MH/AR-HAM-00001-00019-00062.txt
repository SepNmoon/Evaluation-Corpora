Edinburgh April 2 d 1774 Saucy as I have alway known My dear Ward I now think she has even outdone her own saucineſs what to insist that I shall not ask any thing about Mrs- R—— & to deſire me to mistrust every thing good under the Cloak of an Old Maiden I can not ſay they ever had much of my good opinion but the fondneſs that one had always shewen my Dear Ward had reconciled me at least to her , but I think you ought to have let me into the whole affair before you had ſent so very absolute an order to me never to trust them , So pray my dear Girl open all the affair in your next & hide nothing of this transaction neceſsary to let me judge between the Old & the Young Maiden for ſurely the thing is terrible ſince you take it up so very high and ſince news is not to be had from Northampton let me have your little Heart unburdened entirely that my mind may be at ease as I am quite sure she has ſaid or done ſomething off or to you that is not true & as I shall hear of it perhaps another way , should rather have it from yourself then any other way , so pray indulge that peevish humour you say you are in & let us have the whole affair en veritie without hiding any one thing especially as you 'll have a very partial judge so write as ſoon as I have , not having had yours half an hour in the house . I own I am ſurprised that Mr Brown has not wrote after all he ſaid to me I have not ſeen him ſince but shall write him a note either to night or tomorrow tho I imagine he is in the country being holyday time Could I ever imagine that Miſs Hamilton ( would think my telling her my own happineſs ) should be call ing me teizingly provoking had I thought so I would not have wrote one word of a Volume instead of the thouſands I mention , had you been seventy Envy that oldmaidish attendant might have taken hold of you but for you a Young amiable Girl not out of your teens to be so very waspish as to be peevish at one of your best friends happineſs is quite a riddel to me and I believe will take all your Rhetoric to reconcile , and to make your Envy a little eaſier allow me to tell you that having no room big enough that I can spare from this very small house I have taken rooms next door and have put them all up in Boxes & trunks so that I am reduced to a very few Hundreds instead of thouſands which makes me full as peevish as your peevish Ladyship can be for the blood of you so will not write one word more to night . Yes but I will write on in purpose to shew you I will not do one thing to oblige you as I know you would rather that I had finished . So your Young Lady is not to your gout , but she is bearable is she ? than bear with her as long as poſsible that you may not make Mama uneaſy if she percieves you dont like her and make your absence as short as poſsible and then get quit of it her & take care never to invite her a second time as that would be unpardonable both to plague the Girl & yourself for believe me if she is not to your gout she will very soon see that if she has ſense & you will then be as little to hers so then the seldomer you are together the better for both . The Picture was certainly not clear . I think Miſs Thursby puts off her marriage too long , as does Mr Hope his going from Northampton where he is quite idle & might be better employed else where as I would think , but as I am quite ignorant of his affairs I beg pardon for speaking abt them to you , so now I think I have anſ wered yo shall only add that Lady Napier & all my joins me in best wishes to Mrs Hamilton you & believe me to be My dearest Mary yours most affcly- N—— I send you the four ages from Ovid & can aſsure you they were never printed if you like them perhaps I may send some other things of the ſame author -- I was obliged to open this letter again hav ing forgot to inclose it before I sealed it Send yr opinion of the inclosed frankly & if you please correct & amend them Sir Patrick Warrender Haddington Burghs free Miſs Hamilton
