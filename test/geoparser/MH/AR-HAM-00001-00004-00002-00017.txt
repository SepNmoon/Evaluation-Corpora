Dear Sir , I was very glad to hear of your safe arrival at Taxal & of your having had so agreeable a meeting of Friends , who I hope are more composed than when you left them . I am now sorry that I made you any proposition on Robert 's account , as I much fear such a companion wou 'd break in upon your domestic quiet ; you perceive I have not been unfair in my representations of him & I am too candid to flatter you with the hopes of any speedy amendment in him with such a mind , where the bias is to falsehood in preference of truth , even in matters of indifference . You say he has behaved well for some days past , a poor stock of merit for you to trust to ! I can not bring myself to offer a single argument to persuade you and Mrs. Dickenson to take the charge of such a Guest ; if however from affection to me you can make such a sacrifice of your own happineſs I will leave him with you , & accede to the Terms you have proposed , which you may be aſsured shall be kept secret from Robert ; you must therefore contrive to make him write to me immediately for my permiſsion to accept your invitation of continuing at Taxal for a longer period . I know he is at this time very ill provided with Cloaths of every sort ; as soon as it is ascertain 'd that he is to remain with you he shall be supplied with every thing neceſsary . I prefer ordering every thing for him myself having met with bad encouragement to trust to his discretion . I shou 'd be glad you wou 'd send me the direction how I am to send Things to Taxal ; having lost the one you gave me . Mrs. H . & my Daughter desire to be affectionately rememberd with me to you & Mrs. Dickenson . I remain with great regard Dear Sir , Your faithful Humble Servt Frederick Hamilton September 19 th . 1791 . N o . 19 . Orchard St . Portman Sqr . John Dickenson Esqr . Taxal .
