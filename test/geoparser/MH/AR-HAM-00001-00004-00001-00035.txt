Dear Mrs. Dickenson , Accept my best thanks for your two most obliging letters ; tho ' my son has but a very weak understanding , he has great cunning , & has been so long in the practice of it , that he often succeeds in duping those who are disposed to give credit to his sincerity . The consciousneſs of having acted below the character of a Gentleman in all respects , & the reproaches he has met with in consequence of such conduct give him no uneasineſs , he writes to me from Taxal with all poſsible chearfulneſs forgetting that the impreſsions he left with me of him were that he was a confirm 'd Impostor & these impreſsions are further confirmed by discoveries since we parted . I have said thus much painful as it may be to put you upon your guard . As no Person can have a clearer in sight into his real character & disposition than myself , I have therefore the greatest perplexity in forming any reasonable plan for his future life . As he is at present , no plan cou 'd succeed , it is perfectly clear then that unleſs an amendment of his mind can be brought about & some ideas of a moral sense be given him of which he is at present totally destitute there can be no reformation . My Son knows that I have treated him with the utmost candor , & have never upbraided him for follies natural to young men . my remonstrances & invectives have been pointed only against falsehood & dishonesty those poisonous qualities if not eradicated must destroy my feelings as a Parent . Had you not very kindly preſs 'd his visit to Taxal I shou 'd never have proposed it to him , knowing him to be unfit for your society . I perfectly recollected your partiality for him & from thence flatter 'd myself with the hopes that you might , as you have done , enter into his situation & at last give him such a view of it as wou 'd even startle himself , he is too far gone for slight hints to have effect , you need not fear to preſs him home , but as I know that you are more conversant in the modes of persuasive advice than most of my Friends , I submit to your goodneſs a case that will indeed try your skill . I beg leave to repeat that I do not mean to put your patience to too long a trial , my Son has a promised visit upon his hands , to his Uncle Mr. Daniell at Lichfield , he is much my Friend & of course interested for Robt . it will perhaps be lucky for him to build upon your foundations raise an Edifice between you , the Architects will be sure of meeting with my utmost gratitude . What can I say of Sr. W. H . ? nothing to his credit , I had therefore better say nothing . As for the request you make of my coming to Taxal upon a certain occasion , were it the only test I cou 'd give of my affection & regard for you & my Friend Mr. Dickenson , it cou 'd not be refused , but however consolatory the satisfactions given by my B.r may be to palliate the proposed union , I sincerely confeſs that my private sentiments are so averse to it , that a more improper person cou 'd not well be chosen for the proposed office . I trust my excuse in your hands . I have lived in terms of friendship with Palombi from my Br . 's of him , & shou 'd be sorry to disgust him . I shall tell busineſs in London prevented my attendance , we may as well agree in the reason aſsigned . I have just taken a very good House on Lease in Portman Square but my occupations preparatory to my going into it , which can not well be till the beginning of Novr . are not given in excuse . You may conceive in what a dilemma I am in respecting my conduct to some Friends who have lately left you , I may tell you that I fear that it will not be satisfactory to them . I believe I shall write to Robt in a Post or two Mrs. H . & my Daughter desire to be affectionately rememberd with me to you & Mr. Dickenson I remain Dr . Mrs. D Your faithful & Affectionate Humble Sert . Frederick Hamilton August 1 st . 1791 N o . 19 Orchard St . Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel in Frith Derbyshire
