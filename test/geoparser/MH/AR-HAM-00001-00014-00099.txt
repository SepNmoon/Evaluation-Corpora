Queens Lower Lodge ye 13 -- Sepbr Tho ' you did not desire I might be told of an Event in which yr̅ happineſs is so very much concerned yet my Dr Miſs Hamilton when I heard it I could not be Silent , for be aſsured that many who have made more profeſsions do not wish you more permanent Felicity than I do , long , long my Dear may you enjoy all earthly Happineſs , the Person whom you honor with yr̅ Hand will be so I have no doubt nor do I , that he will make it his Study to make you equally so . I promised Mlle Moulá to leave my Letter open that she might add a couple of Lines Adieu Ever Affly Yr- MCGoldsworthy My dear Miſs Hamilton , I most sincerely rejoice in every event that Your Happineſs is concerned in , I do most fervently wish you joy , and as much permanent happineſs as this World will permit -- and much more than usualy falls to the lot of Mortals -- as Your choice does you much honor , may you long injoy together -- the supreme felicity , of affection and truth -- L C --
