Sunday Evening 3 d Octbr . 1784 . My Dear Miranda I am very sorry to hear that you have had an inflammation in your Eyes ; & at the same time was very much disappointed in not seeing you at Sunning hill , when you was in the Country ; I certainly told you , when you went to Mrs. Jackson s , & would let me know when it suited you , & our House at liberty , I would send the carriage for you : If there is any mistake on my part I am very sorry for it ; after the first week , of your being there , I had a Bed at your service , & no one would have been more wellcome then your Self to have occupied it . I shall now hope to see you from Bullstrode , if the good Dutcheſs , will be so good to send you over ; & I will take care to send you back ; I love Miranda , & shall not take it kind if you do n't continue it so . -- I hope by that time , our friend Ann Clarke will be with us . -- We have had Mr. R : Glover with us these three weeks , part of the time he was confind with a fever ; he admires this place very much , & is very fond of his Sister , which makes me very happy to observe it ; I have been a constant attendat upon poor Penny ; I now fear there is no chance for her life , so I hope in God , She will soon be releas 'd from all her troubles . -- Mary will take the pen out of my hand . you are oft in my thoughts . upon one subject , succeſs attend you . -- God bleſs you . -- Mr. G : love -- E Glover Dearest Miſs H I must write a few lines to you to tell you that I am much concern 'd for your indisposition . Last week my father & Mrs .. Lenton went to Weybridge , & brought me word that they had seen the Tamest Squirrel they ever saw , that it belong 'd to Mrs : Holland 's coachman , therefore as he was not in their way they could not buy it , but however my father went yesterday & bought it , & brought it home & gave it me , it is very pretty , very tame , & in short I am already very fond of it , as is my mother my father & c & c ; the other Squirrels nose is out of joint . I am in great hopes to see my Dr .. Miſs Ann , ere long , Mr. R. G . goes to Holiford to morrow & stays one night , mrs Jackson has been often here but we had always notice of it , as she was afraid ( I do Suppose ) that Mr. Jackson would think that she wish 'd to see us , I often think of her with tears , & you my Dr .. Miſs H—— whom ere long we shall lose , I hope Mr. D- is well , I heard last night that you were to be at next Saturday ; I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you here . Mr .. R. G . leaves us to morrow , he has been three weeks here . The Coles leave this place on Wednesday ; A Colonel Hartley has bought Mr. Pitt s ; I hope he will be a good neighbour . We went to pay our Compts .. to Princeſs Royal last Wednesday , but were disappointed as none of Family walk 'd on the terrace , there was a good deal of Company . Mrs. L . desires her best Compts .. to you . & now I must conclude myself Dr . Miſs H—— yrs . Sincerely & Affectionately M. G—— P.S . I hope & beg if you can contrive , you will come over here you will make us so very happy Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street Piccadilly
