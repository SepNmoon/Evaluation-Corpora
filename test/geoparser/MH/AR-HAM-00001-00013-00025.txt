Albemarle Street Oct .. 25 th . 1785 My Dear Mrs. Dickenson My Mother has this moment receiv 'd your very kind & truly affectionate letter , we both of us thank you in the sincerest manner for it ; My Dearest Father continues much as he was , when our dear Anna Maria wrote to you last , no better , these last two nights he has not slept well , notwithstanding his opiates , which he takes every night , my dearest mother is extremely wretched , & indeed I begin to grow fearful that she should hurt herself , her spirits are very bad , which you will not wonder at , as we are in constant anxiety & misery ; we are in of a fearful that he is apprehended to be in danger as Dr. Brocklesby & Mr. Devaynes have never flatter 'd us since they first saw him , they think he may continue for some months , as he has a great deal of strength still left ; he is I thank God in no pain , that is a great comfort ; he is very patient , he neither murmurs nor complains ; I do not think that he thinks himself in danger . Oh my dearest dear friend what a loſs , it is our duty to submit to the will of our maker , but it will be a hard very hard trial whenever the fatal day approaches comes , he will no doubt meet with that happineſs hereafter , which dearest best of men in this world he has never experienced . We most sincerely thank you for your kind offer , & we never doubted your faithful friendship , no my dear friend we beg you will not think of coming , my mother says she would not afflict your tender heart , & that as to herself nothing but time can be of any use to her , she begs you will forgive her not writing a few lines to you , but her spirits are so low that she can not put pen to paper . I can not add another line to day , & as I hope to be able to get a frank , will finish to-morrow . Wednesday morning My Father has had a very indifferent night & is as usu l a l to day ; when my mother told him yesterday of your letter , & very kind offer of coming to us , he replied , I hope I shall struggle through it , & get amongst them again ; dearest man I wish there was any hopes of his getting well . I wrote to my Brother , who is come to Town & is wth . us a great deal , all our friends are kind in sending , & none more attentive than Mr & Mrs- Hamilton , they are both well , & I think Miſs H—— is grown . Mrs. Strothoff to whose behaviour I intirely attribute this last attack of my Father s has never been here , & her excuse is that she can not bear to see her brother ill , that it would quite overcome her ; she has behaved extremely ill ever since Mrs. Burgeſs 's death ; & my Father has been much hurt . Our dear & amiable friend Anna Maria returns to Town to-morrow for the winter , she was with us for four days last week , & came again on Sunday , return 'd to Harwood on Monday , she hopes that her affairs are now in a very fair way of being settled , it is & has always been my astonishment that Mr. J—— should not himself have been anxious for the sake of his wife & children to have them settled long ago , it would have sav 'd our amiable friend from a great deal of anxiety . Pray thank Mr. Dickenson & your very amiable siſters for their kind concern on our accounts , & tell them we have a sincere regard for them , ( though at present personally unknown to each other ) for their very affectionate & tender regard for our dear and amiable friend Miranda . Our Affectionate love to Mr Dickenson ( dont be jealous ) we very very often think of you , both & with no small pleasure to reflect how happy you both are . My Mother 's maid Clarke sets up every night , nor can we persuade her to change with the other maids , my Father likes her as she is very clever about sick people , she goes to bed about six o'clock in the morning & lays for four f or five hours , she is quite a comfort to us ; my Father takes a great deal of nourishment , such as broth , Sago , Caudle , & Chocolate . You have desired Anna Maria to send you an account everyday , as he is likely to continue for so long a time , I think it will be puting you to an unneſsesary expence , & once or twice a week either Miſs A. C . or myself will certainly write to you to let you know how our dear Father goes on . My Mother desires her most Affectionate love to you . I am my dear Mrs. Dickenson 's Ever oblig 'd & affectionate Mary Glover we beg our best Compts .. to Mr & Miſs Dickensons . Friday 28 th .. My Father has had a very indifferent night , but is no worse to day . I have some news to tell you which I am sure you will rejoice to hear , my mother applied to Mr Reveley last summer , if he had an opportunity , she wrote should esteem it a very great favor , to raise Mr- Bems in the Excise office , Mrs. G .. receiv 'd a letter from him last night , to say that he had appointed him to be a brandy officer , with which William is very much pleas 'd . Once more my dearest friend Adieu . -- Miſs Glover Oct : 25 th 1785 Mrs. Dickenson
