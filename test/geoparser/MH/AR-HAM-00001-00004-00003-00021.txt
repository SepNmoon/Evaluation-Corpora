35 Aldgate High St : London . April 23 d : 1807 . You will be surprized , my dear Cousin , to hear that I am just returned to London . Understanding that Mrs : Mann received a letter of kind enquiries after me , from you , yesterday , I lose no time in thanking you for them . The reason I did not trouble you by writing again from Bath , was , that every day was so perfectly alike , that I really had nothing to communicate . My poor dear Father grew more and more affectionately solicitous for my future comfort ; towards which , he is well convinced , the rejoining my Husband , is the first step . Till we know whether his engagement in Dublin , would be continued for the ensuing season , it was impossible to act . In this state of affairs , I received a letter from my Sister , informing me that Mr : Jones , the Proprietor of the Dublin Theatre , was in London , upon busineſs . My Father then ( tho ' he much regretted parting with me ) agreed with me in opinion , that I had best seize the opportunity of having an interview with him , in order to get some light into my future prospects . Accordingly , here I am . I go to-morrow , for a few days , to my Sister 's , where I may see Mr : Jones . You will , I know , my dear Cousin , be glad to hear that all violence about the unlucky transaction I formerly explained to you , has subsided , both on the part of my Father and on that of my Sister . She is really very kind on the present occasion ; for she says , that if I learn that Mr : Holman retains his present situation , she will take me over with her , to Dublin , this Summer ; by which means I should travel with every comfort . Meanwhile , I shall be in an anxious state of suspense ; for , even should Mr : Jones 's intentions be favourable , I must consult Mr : Holman before I proceed . If you are kind enough to write again , direct to me here , as I can only be backwards and forwards at my Sister 's , for a few days at a time , as she is able to receive me ; for Mr : Best 's affairs are in so lamentable a state of derangement , that poor Lady Emily occasionally occupies the only spare room the house affords . Plainly to speak , Mr : Best has got into the King 's Bench . I hope it may not be for long ; but fear West India property is in a very bad way . Having given you a long chapter of self , I now wish to enquire after you , my cousin Louisa , and Mr : J : Dickenson . Mr : Dickenson senr : , I conclude , is recovered -- he is very happy in his son and daughter 's tender attentions . The extract you transmitted me from Mr : J : D : 's letter affords a strong proof ( were any wanting ) of the goodneſs of his heart . -- You were kindly attentive in making the neceſsary communication to Mrs. Hamilton ; they , however , took no notice . -- Poor the Cathcarts has been , twice , so extremely ill , that I was in great danger of losing her . Thank God , she is now better . She desires best respects to you . Have the goodneſs to present my Compliments to Mrs : Mann , Mrs : de Salis , and such of your other neighbours as I have the pleasure of being acquainted with . I left my poor dear Father in amended health , but very depreſsed spirits . I sadly want to persuade him to come to London for a little change of scene ; but am doubtful of succeeding . Adieu , my dear Cousin . With kindest love to Mrs : Bloſset and Mr : Dickenson , believe me your truly obliged and affectionate Louisa . Jane Holman Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire .
