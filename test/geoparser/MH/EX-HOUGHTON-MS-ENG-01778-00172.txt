Teston in Kent 3 d . June -- 86 My dear Friend Many thanks to You for Your kind condolence on my late very affecting loſs , I thank God , it is mitigated by all the alleviations You mention . The age indeed of my poor Mother was not great , she was only 65 , but her sufferings were extreme , and I feel that I ought not only to be resigned but thankful for her release ; and now that the f irst feelings of Nature and sorrow have given w ay to reason and reflection , I trust I am so , tho I suffered very sensibly for a time , and the uneasineſs produced its usual consequence , a d isorder in My Stomach , but my health and Spirits are now pretty well , and both much mended from the sweet place and pleasant society , I now enjoy . Mrs. Garrick and myself have been for some days on our annual visit to our excellent friends Lady Middleton and Mrs. Bouverie at this charming place , of both the place , and the ladies , You have often heard me speak in terms of high praise My Winter on the whole was a pleasant one ; I avoided as much as poſsible those great aſsemblies which are almost always positively disagreeable , and at best have seldom any thing to interest or delight one . but I was almost always constantly engaged at dinners and small parties . I think our friends , I mean our talking and thinking friends , are grown wiser , and do not meet in such hords as we used to me meet by which means I have had more real enjoyment of society than usual . Our dear Mrs. Vesey has not those set Parties at which You have so often aſsisted , but as she is known to be always at home she is seldom without half a dozen people in an Evening . Mrs. Carter Mr. Walpole and I , have had little regular aſsignations about once a Week , and when we have been so happy as to escape an irruption of fine ladies , have enjoyed ourselves prodigiously . We had a parting dinner there just before I left Town , but our dear hosteſs in one of her delightful blunders , forgetting whom she had invited , asked so many others , that it became too large and spoilt our little project , and then as usual , instead of enjoying what she had , the dear Soul wasted her day in regret for what She fancied She had lost . I am deeply grieved to say that I think she declines visibly ; I do not mean that her bodily health is much impaired , but her sweet Mind is much broken and her memory greatly shatter 'd . Of this too she has such a quick perception that she feels her own decay with the keenest sensibility . It is impoſsible not to be interested about her , especially now that her friends are daily dropping away ; Mrs. Carter her great dependence already gone , and the rest going . She has some idea of going to Tunbridge in the Summer , I hope her Nephew 's kindneſs will enable her to do it : That Young Man has won much of my affection by his generous attention to our friend . I do indeed conceive how great must have been your joy at the sight of Lady Cremorne From the perverseneſs of croſs engagements I have not been able to profit by her oblig'ing d ispositions towards me , as much as I wished . I was at her house at Chelsea a few nights a go , to inquire after our suffering friend Mr. Burrows , who was there for the Air ; the Accounts I got of him were not comfortable ; I think his v aluable life in no small danger ; they can not s ubdue his fever and cough , and You know he i s a bad Subject for these violent Attacks . His life is not only a bleſsing to his family , but q uite a public concern to all who wish well to the rising race . Rev . Dr. Burrows , with whom I dined that day , carried me to Mrs. Boscawen 's I told her I had just got a letter from You , She seemed rejoiced to hear so good an Account o f You , and charged me to remember her to You I have seen a great deal of Mr. Burrows ( I believe her Son is somewhat better ) The Ball on Mrs. Walsingham 's birth day last week was very fine , I was invited , but not being in a situation to go , I excused myself on a promise of spending a day in a quiet way , which I did the very day I got your letter ; I delivered Your Compliments , and was charged with many civilities in return . Miſs Boyle , after whom You enquire , has had a very miserable time of it ever since he came to Town . A violent and alarming Sciatica , has confined him a close prisoner the greatest part of the time ; even his charming Spirits sunk under the severity of this Attack , but I had the comfort to see him much better and to wind up my Town adventures by spending the evening with him at Mr. Smelt 's , where were also Mrs. Ord and Mr . ; With Mrs. Hastings latter the former I was much pleased ; There is a remarkable simplicity in his person dreſs and manners , indicative of that excellent good Sense he poſseſses . She , You know , is in the other extreme , very shewy in her person and appearance , but of sprightly and pleasant manners . I hear very good Accounts of dear Husband , Mrs. Delany saw her a week ago , and found her better than she expected . She had even courage enough to entertain an idea of going up to the Abbey Music ; one is glad that she felt bold enough to think of it and more glad , methinks that she did not put it in exectution , as it wou 'd have been too great an expence of health and Spirits . That wretched Woman her Niece has half broken her heart . -- We go to London next thursday , stay only one day , then to Hampton for a couple of days ; after which Miſs Burney carries me down to Mrs. Garrick 's in Berkſhire ; I shall remain with her till the 17 th , then return to my long deserted friends at Bristol ; and soon after establish myself at my beloved Cowslip Green for the Summer ; having excused myself to Mrs. Montagu , Lady Spencer and my other good friends who were so good as to invite me to leave my Cottage for their Caſtles . Direct to me as usual at Bristol . Say all manner of kind things for me to Lady Mount Edgcumbe and present my best respects to Mr. D . . Lady Wake does not deserve that I shou 'd send her love to You , as she is too lazy to aſsure You of it with her own hand . Adieu my dear friend ! Yrs . affectionately Mrs. Garrick
