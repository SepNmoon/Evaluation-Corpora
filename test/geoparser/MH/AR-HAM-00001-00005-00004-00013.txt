Dr Dickenson I returned too late to frank the Covers for this days post -- I am very sorry to hear no better accounts of Mrs Holman . I suppose her Case almost desperate I should be happy to do any thing to relieve her were it in my power & equally so inclined towards her unfortunate Father but I believe each are now out of my power . With best Compts . to Mrs Dickenson I am always sincerely yours Warwick May 25 th . 1810 . J. Dickenson Esqr Welbeck Street
