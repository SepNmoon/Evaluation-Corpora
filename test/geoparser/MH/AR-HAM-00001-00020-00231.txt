27 , S t . James 's Street 29 th - Janry- 1809 My Dear Sister , I have often been told that when a Lady writes a Letter , She never explains her meaning , 'till the Postscript . Your Letter of the 27 th . Inst- seems to confirm this observation , for after commanding Me to send to Lady Charlotte Finch & c & c , You stick in a scrap of Paper , saying , “ if you do not approve of “ this , do not do it . ” Without this latitude , I should certainly have sent my Servant to Lady Charlotte Finch 's & c , although , I confeſs it did appear to me odd , to make enquiries in the Name of a Person who was in Beds , & not in Town to receive the answer . Had you been pleased to have inclosed Notes of enquiry for Lady Charlotte , or for Mrs- Boscawen , my Servant should have delivered them , & They , would probably have sent You an Answer . But , being an entire Stranger to both of them , I think , they would have been somewhat surprised at receiving a Meſsage from me . Consequently , I have sent none . Your three packets have not reached me . I trust , they will not be lost ; but , why did you send me Manuscript papers ? I sent You a paper from my friend Mr. Wood , in addition to the Queries , I had put to You ; and , if you had been Graciously pleased to have marked the Answers , on Mr. Wood s paper , the full purpose would have been answered , and your Manuscripts might have remained in perfect security at Leighton . It is lucky for You that I am not your Hub . If I had been , I should have scolded You for running the Risque of losing your Papers . Major Stanhope , was the Son of Lord Stanhope , not of Lady Stanhope . Lady Cis , is at Hampton Court . Sir John Moore 's Aid de Camp , Anderson , is not her Son in Law . With best affections to Yourself , Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , & c I ever am , My Dear Sister Your faithful Friend & Brother Napier With best wishes to my Countrywoman , tell her that I met with no good Apples in Scotland -- London , Thirtieth January 1809 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House .
