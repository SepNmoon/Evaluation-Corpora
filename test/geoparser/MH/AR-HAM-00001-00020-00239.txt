71 , Queen Street 27 th - Oct r - 1809 My Dear Sister , I am glad to find that You have got your London Plan arranged , and shall be most happy to pay my civilities to You in Welbeck Street . I am rather surprised that You should have agreed to that Situation , as the attractive Charms of Lady Cecilia Johnston , in Wimpole Street , will certainly carry off Your Husband from You . I returned Yesterday from celebrating the Jubilee , on the 25 th . Instant at Selkirk . The day was made doubly interesting to me , from my Son Lieutenant Napier contriving to meet me there from London . He has just got his promotion from the Admiralty , and I have added to his Dignities by making him one of my Deputy Lieutenants , and swearing him in as a Justice of the Peace . He is a great whacking fellow , and in the Case of Riots , appears well calculated to thrash the Mob . I had not the least Idea of meeting him at Selkirk , but as he knew I was to be there on the 25 th . , he cro≈øsed over from Newcastle , to meet and afforded me an Opportunity of introducing him to the Gentlemen of the County . He was 23 , the 13 th . of this Month . After remaining here a few Weeks , he will again get afloat . His Mother & c had not seen him for five Years ; They still stare at his size . As He is just going with me to see my Sister , & many others , I have neither time , nor composure enough to write more . Best love to Mr. Dickenson , Louisa & c Ever My Dear Sister , Your faithful Friend and affectionate Brother Napier Mrs- Waddington is come to live here . She is one of your old Blue Stocking Ladies . My Aunt Ly . Sarah , wished Ly . N . to call on her , but , I said No ; not till I am satisfied that her Husband is not the Notorious Waddington of Hop Celebrity . Perhaps , You can tell me ?
