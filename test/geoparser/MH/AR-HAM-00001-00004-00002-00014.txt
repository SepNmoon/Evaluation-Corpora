Dear Sir , I was unavoidably detain 'd , by the illneſs of my Curate till yesterday , at my Living in Suffolk , by which I have been prevented from acquitting myself to you sooner , which I ought to have done , & which I hope you will have the goodneſs to excuse . I found every thing at Stanton , which is the name of my Living , on the whole , very satisfactory ; a very tolerable House , now well furnish 'd , excellent Offices & c . a charming Country with very good Roads , & Post Coaches from London daily paſsing by my House . I hope you have gone on well with your Works , for that purpose , the weather has been favorable , tho ' in other respects very disagreeable for some time past . Pray remember me affectionately to Mrs. Dickenson who I hope is well as also my little God Daughter , I remain with sincere regard & esteem . Dear Sir , Your faithful Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street -- 249 April 7 th . 1790 . Enclosing a Bank Post Bill for £25.0.0 from Meſsrs .
