Sunning hill ye 29 th . Septr . 1780 . Dear Miranda By your letter of ye 25 th I am happy to hear of your health and agreeable situation at Eastbourne . When you reflect on the nature of our laſt correſpondence , you could not expect another letter from me , till I had been appriſ 'd of the final iſsue ; for which I have long been waiting , and was happy to find in your laſt : I sincerely congratulate you upon it . as for Catherine & Nanny -- let them excuſe themſelves ; no juſtification shall they have from me . They had the confidence to treat me with a regular scolding in your behalf ; when I little thought , they had been so guilty themſelves without the shadow of a plea . Excepting Nanny 's face , of which she complains from time to time , I can safely affirm that we have no indiſpoſitio n among us : she is taking the bark for hers , and we hope with succeſs . Adieu , my dear Miranda , & believe me ever Your affectionate father R Glover . M L eonidas Septr . 29 th - 1780
