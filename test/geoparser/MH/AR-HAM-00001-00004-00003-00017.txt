October 11 th : 1806 . The Hill Top -- near Weobley Herefordshire . My dear Cousin , It is so very long since I wrote to you , that I am almost ashamed to addreſs you . Were you with me , I could account in various ways , for my silence , by explaining plans and prospects , that I meant to communicate , and that fell to the ground instead of affording matter for a letter , & c. -- While I deferred deferred from day to day ( which by the by ) is the worst way in the world ) writing to you , my return to England took place , at a very short notice ; for that was the effect of a change of plan . I had intended , as Mr : Holman 's engagement in Dublin is renewed for this Winter , remaining there , while he transacted what was to be done in England ; but on reflection , I found I must come over , on account of busineſs relative to this place , for which we wished to find a tenant -- Mr : Holman 's having accepted theatrical engagements , made it uncertain what time he would have to arrange any thing . -- Now , to a part of my chapter of grievances , since I came home . In the first place , I was very ill the former period of my coming , owing to a fauſse couche . I had no suspicion of my situation , or I should not have ventured upon the journey and voyage . In the next place , we have not succeeded in finding a tenant ; the consequence of which , is , that I shall have to remain here , great part of the Winter , instead of returning to Dublin with Mr : Holman , according to my firm expectation . I have other uneasineſses , that I would tell you if we were together ; but that I do n't like to write -- the worst of all , however , is being obliged to be so much separated from Mr : Holman . Pour comble de malheur , I am going to lose Mann , who is very shortly to be married . She will be most eligibly established ; therefore I ought to rejoice ; but parting from a friend of eleven years ' tried attachment , very much damps the satisfaction I should otherwise feel . -- I fear you will say that I might as well have kept silence a little longer , as write such a letter of lamentation and egotism . To speak truth , I am far from entertaining , at present ; for my spirits are quite lowered by one croſs circumstance or another . Mr : Holman is now at Bristol : I expect him home about the 22 d : , on his way to Ireland . We only came over in August ; so his vacation is but a short one . It is high time , now , I think , to ask after you , Mr : Dickenson , and my Cousin , Louisa . I hope you are all well . I have not heard of your being at Cheltenham ( where Mr : Holman was , the other day ) ; -- I therefore flatter myself your health has not needed it . My Father and Mother got tired of Cheltenham , and have taken a house at Bath . Do you ever hear any thing of them ? I suppose not ; for I recollect they shewed no very extraordinary Kindneſs when you were at Cheltenham . However , these are subjects better discuſsed verbally , than by letter -- if worth discuſsing , any how ; which , perhaps , you will agree , admits of doubt . I hope you will soon let me hear from you , notwithstanding my seeming negligence . I believe I shall be here some months : at the same time , my movements have been , for some years , so extremely uncertain , that I should not be surprised at any other arrangement . One consolation is , that none can be so disagreeable as the present ; which you will easily understand ; as I believe , living in one place , while Mr : Dickenson was in another , would not at all please you . Pray remember me affectionately , to him and my Cousin -- I hope she practises her singing . -- I should almost hesitate sending you this dull scrawl , but that any thing is better than the continued appearance of inattention . Hoping very soon to have a letter containing good accounts of you all , I remain , my dear Cousin , most sincerely yours . Jane Holman . P.S . How is Mr : Dickenson senr : ? I hope , well .
