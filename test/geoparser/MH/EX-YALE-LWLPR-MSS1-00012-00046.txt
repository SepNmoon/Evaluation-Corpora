Berkeley Square Dec . 22 . 1787 . I have had a long combat with myself , Madam , before I coud decide whether I shoud take the liberty of writing to you or not on a most flattering Portrait which you found in the Spectator , & sent to our poor Friend Mrs Vesey , thinking with a most partial eye , that It resembled me -- how you will be surprized , Madam , when I do write , & you find nothing but reproaches , instead of gratitude ! Gratefull I am indeed for the partiality that could blind such penetration & judgement as yours -- but shoud not I be the vainest of Mankind , if I did not protest against your Friendship adapting to me a finished picture of a most amiable character drawn by the exquisite Pencil of Mr Addison ? Oh ! Madam , I am covered with confusion -- & so , forgive me for saying , woud you be , shoud They who know me better , be apprized of your Compliment . In rigorous Justice I ought to lay open all my faults & defects to you -- but tho I disclaim all pretensions to the Portrait , am I obliged to destroy your good Opinion , which does me so much honour ? must I punish myself because you are too benevolent ? May not the few remaining Days that are left to me taste the sweetneſs of thinking that one excellent Woman has favorable thoughts of me ? Age & repeated Illneſs do not strow many flowers on the end of our Path ; & is not the reflection that We must leave those we love , sufficient trial of our Philosophy ? are we enjoined to labour that they shoud not regret us ? yes , Madam , I coud contradict your Panegyric paragraph by Paragraph ; but tho I again & again disavow it , Self Love , I confeſs , does make me wish that some faint traces of it may remain in the kind breast that conceived it ; & that even when you discover the misapplication , you may say , “ well , at least I am sure he wished to have deserved that I shoud think so favorably of him : I know he thought my Esteem infinitely valuable , for except on him , when did I bestow it unworthily ? Was not my Choice of Mr Dickenson a proof of my Discernment in merit ? ” I am flattered , Madam , with the hope of seeing you in Spring : then perhaps I may be more frank on the catalogue of my faults and Deficiencies -- somebody has said , that rather than not talk of ourselves , we are content even to abuse ourselves -- but nobody has said that we like to give the Satire under our hands . Still I have so many obligations to you , Madam , for repeated expreſsions of favour towards me in your letters to Miſs Clarke , that as I doubt I shall not have all the time I wish to pay those many Debts , you will probably escape an ugly confeſsion , and at least you shall not find Ingratitude in the list of my Sins . Miſs A Clarke to be sure has prepared you , Madam , for the deplorable Situation in which you will find our poor dear Friend -- it is so dreadfull , that I daily wish to see it worse , for indeed She is scarce sensible of any thing but her own misery -- oh ! yes ! momentary gleams of her most constitutional Virtue , Benevolence , still break out -- the sight of those She loves still enliven her for a moment -- but she can not converse with them for two minutes coherently , nor expreſs the glimmerings of Ideas she retains . The suffering & Patience of Mrs Hancock are not to be described -- were it not for her comfort , I coud almost wish that very Few were admitted to see her Friend ! Some indeed show they are worthy of performing so respectable a Duty ! I fear , madam , I have trespaſsed too long -- I meant to complain of yr prejudice -- -- but I doubt I have not been angry enough -- so hard it is for you to disoblige -- & of all men living who is leſs disposed to censure you than yr most obedient humble Sert HorWalpole Berkley Square Dec. 22 d . 1787 .
