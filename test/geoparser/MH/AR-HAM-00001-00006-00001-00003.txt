12 th March 1785 My Dear Madam I beg You will present my best Thanks to Mr Dickenson for the Favour He did me this Morning . I am afraid He will think Me a great Goſsip , but to day I was oblig 'd to go down early to the House of Lords expecting to be call 'd upon to swear , in relation to a Bill my Son had before a Comitee of their Lordps . : returning home I calld upon Mrs. Delany & found Her well . I had the Pleasure to see Mr Dickenson last Night & the intention to present my self to Him but He was engag 'd in Conversation with Mr. Pulteney all the while I was in the room , & I had not the courage or impertinence to interrupt Him . Allow me to say that my very sincere good Wishes attend for His Happineſs I believe I need not say whether Yours is included in this Wish or that I am with the highest Esteem & Regard Dear Madam your faithfull & Obedient Servant F.
