Q . H . 23 d of June 1780 . My dear Miſs Hamilton . When a Child is naughty , a good parent corrects it in order to make it the better behaved , Pray , can You tell me ? what punishment is to be made use of , when the Physician recommends bathing in the Sea and it is not complied with ? I am very impatient to have that point determined , as is I intend practising it upon a certain Miſs . M. H . who promised Dr- Turton to wash herself quite clean , and who since her arrival at Eastbourne pretends to be a little fearfull , for I dare not make use of the Word which begins with a C . for fear of Shocking Your delicacy , that I am the more -- anxious to avoid as at best my correspondence can be but little entertaining , when I know that You have so many Friends which are such good scribes and can make their letters so much more interesting . Our head quarters are still in town , and not very likely that the King will leave it soon , it is certainly not so agreable as the Country , yet to a well thinking mind it is always pleasing to fulfill its Duty , and though I have frequently found that the fulfilling that duty is very often connected with difficulty , it is nevertheless attended with a secret inward satisfaction , whic h none but those that act right can enjoy , and which no Earthly power can deprive us of , and can we wont any better approbation than Our ow Conscience ? I think not ! it is the sincerest friend we have , I found it so at all times , & shall endeavour to keep it all alive , for fear my indolence should make it slumber , and my fears should prevent me ever waking it again : that I am afraid has been the case with many , and as I pity them sincerely , I will try to avoid getting into the same difficulty . Lady Warwick is come and lives at her own house in town , She intends leading a very retired life and is ready to receive all her Family , Lady Francis Harper is however by the “ directions -- or orders ” of her Husband to deprive her Mother of this pleasure , which makeſ both parties very unhappy . il y a du pour & du contre dans tout ceci : the duty 's of a Child to a parent is one thing , and the making oneself a party in the indiscretions of a Mother is another , this last can̄ot happen , and the first should be done , car je ne voit pas que la mauvaise conduite d'une Mere , excuse l'enfant a remplir ses devoirs vis a vis d'Elle . this remains amongst Ourselves , but my dear Miſs Hamilton must feel that I am not quite wrong in what I have said . Lady King & her daughter were both at Court last Thursday , Your old Friend seems to recover both good looks & strengths which I was very glad to see , she bore the heat of the room even better than a great many young people present . Lady Dartrey was also at court yesterday , she looks well & talks with great pleasure of being settled at Chelsea . Lady Stormont looked beautiful , when I saw her at court , she is backwards & forwards every day in the country and the air seems to agree with her . Princeſs Daschkow took leave yesterday , she still intends travelling two years longer in France , Italy & Germany . as she is so very delicate a Lady I can not help mentioning what she said to Lady Egremont when talking upon about the riots , where a natural brother of hers played acted a very ungentlemanlike part at Monsieur Cordon s. she said . je ne serai pas faché Milady de le voir un peut pendue . it is so sisterly & feelingly expreſsed that I am sure you are not sorry to know it , it makes one thouroyghly acquainted with the Princeſs es superior Character , which appears to one to be above heumanity & feeling . Pray my dear Miſs Hamilton let not this Paper be read by any Body but Yourself , I know it to be full of faults both in expreſsions and writing , and if I had time would correct it immediately , but I am not Miſtreſs of that nor of myself , therefore excuse the faults & do not expose my ignorance or rather my -- innattention .
