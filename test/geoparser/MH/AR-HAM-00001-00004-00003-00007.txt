Miſs Hamilton Octr . 1786 Dear Mrs : Dickenson -- Thank you for the long Letter that I receiv 'd from you a little while ago -- you see I have taken a large Sheet of Paper in order to pay you in kind ; but I do n't promise that you wo n't be tir 'd before you have got thro ' it -- however , you desir 'd a long Letter , so you must have patience . I had the pleasure of seeing Mrs : and Miſs Glover , a few Days ago -- they were in Town for a couple of Days -- they do n't come to stay , 'till December -- they are both very well -- I told Miſs Glover that I had lately receiv 'd a Letter from you , and that I shou 'd write to you shortly , so she begg 'd me to give her Love to you . I am much oblig 'd to you for the interest you are so good as to take , in the health of my Sister , and her Children -- I had a Letter from her lately , and she was very well -- she mention 'd that her eldest Daughter had been ill , but was recover 'd -- She has three Daughters , but no Son . I see by the Papers , that Maria has got a Son -- so I suppose you will not be permitted to be God-Mother -- As you say Lord Napier is an admirer of mine , I think myself bound in gratitude to take his part -- therefore say , that he is in the right , not to hazard his Son 's Bones , by letting him have an opportunity of receiving any instructions from so saucy a Lady as you -- I think , now , I have taken his part very handsomely . I suppose you know by this time , that it is true that Lord Napier of Bath is dead -- though , upon second thoughts , you may not know it , because , ( being in the Country ) you may not have heard any thing further than what you saw in the News-Papers . Mr : Charles Hamilton is much recover 'd -- travelling he found too much for him , long before he got near Scotland , therefore , return 'd to London -- he is now at Colonel Cathcart s House , in Charles Street , Berkeley Square -- he was with us last Friday Evening , and seem 'd pretty well . Lord Cathcart was likewise with us , and brought Lady Stormont , William , and George -- all the little Charles Murray 's have had the Measles , except Murray -- William and Lord wish 'd much that he shou 'd have them , because he is going to Westminster School -- but he did not catch them tho ' he try 'd for it , by not only being in the House with his Brothers , while they had them , but by nursing little Lady Stormont -- Henry is to go to Westminster , in leſs than a fortnight , I believe -- he is much grown and improv 'd , and is really , as fine a Boy as can be seen , of his age . My Mother has been extremely ill , of a Cold which fell violently on her Lungs -- she had much fever , kept her Bed some Days , and was blooded twice in two Days -- she is now , however , ( thank God , ) pretty well recover 'd , but must be very careful of herself . My Father and myself have been well , excepting colds , and are now quite well . My Father begs his best Compliments to you and William -- he is oblig 'd to you for your desire of making him acquainted with the bad state of the Irish affairs -- he knows it but too well -- all the intelligence you receiv 'd about it is true , but he lives in hopes of an amendment . Mr : Dickenson is very well , and returns her Compliments to you , with thanks for your kind remembrance of her . Dowager Lady Warwick is not yet come to Town . I do n't describe the Plan of our new House to you , because I hope for the pleasure of seeing you in London before it is completed , and I shou 'd have more satisfaction in shewing it to you , than in describing it in a Letter -- However if I must not expect to see you soon , I will describe it as well as I can , in my next Letter . I like our Situation extremely -- indeed it is impoſsible to do otherwise , for it is certainly , one of the finest in London . My Brother is very well , and much flatter 'd by Mrs : Walkinshaw 's & your affectionate remembrance of him -- he does not forget either you , or his friend Mr : Dickenson -- you are both great favourites of his -- he is much grown and improv 'd , and I hear he makes a pretty good progreſs in Latin -- We are now so much more in his Neighbourhood than when we were in Bedford-Square , that 'till very lately , he came to dine with us every Sunday , but the Days are now too short for that . I go on with Music as much as ever , and like it ( of course , ) better and better , the more I know about it . I have learnt Italian since I saw you -- indeed I continue to take Leſsons in it -- I think it a remarkable pretty Language -- it is certainly , peculiarly adapted to Music . Do you walk about much in the Country ? I suppose you do . I walk in Hyde Park when the Weather permits . Do you ride ? I suppose you know that Mr : Dickenson has learnt to drive a pair of Ponies , in a low Phaeton , this Summer -- she likes driving , very much . Miſs Glover came to Town the other Day -- I have not yet seen them , but hope to do so shortly . -- I shou 'd think it must begin to be cold in the Country , but suppose you are grown so hardy , by living there , as not to mind it . This is a stupid Letter enough ; but I ca n't help it -- I seldom have much news to tell . Poor Miſs Clarke 's ( Princeſs Amelia 's Aunt , ) is dying -- indeed she may be dead now , for this Morning 's Paper said , she was but just alive last Night -- it is said , she will be a great loſs , for that she is a very charitable , good , Woman -- I do n't know whether 't is true , but the Papers said , that she never recover 'd the shock she receiv 'd at the death of her Cousin the King , for that she had taken it into her Head some time before his last illneſs , that she shou 'd not long , survive him . I suppose you heard a great deal about the attempt of the King of Pruſsia to aſsaſsinate Margaret Nicholson -- there was more piece of Work than enough , made about it , for the poor Woman was undoubtedly mad -- she has been in Bedlam , ever since a Day or two after her mad action , and I suppose ( poor Creature ! ) will continue there , the remainder of her Life . My Mother desires her best Compliments to you , and says , she is sure you do n't stand in need of any instruction about your Work ; and that she shou 'd commend it very much if she was to see it , for that she knows what a nice Work-Woman you are . Pray give her Compts : and mine to the King . I have seen my charming friend Mr : Dickenson , only once this season in public , as yet -- she call 'd on us the other Morning , and look 'd beautiful , tho ' she was rather indispos 'd , having a great Cold -- I hope soon , to see her perform , again . The next time you do me the favour of writing to me , let me know when I may expect the pleasure of seeing you in London , for I think it very long since I have had that pleasure . Adieu my dear Cousin , believe me yours sincerely Mrs : Siddons October 30 th : 1786 . London .
