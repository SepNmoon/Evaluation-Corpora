on Monday Bell & I go to Town , & on Wednesday to Richmond Park for a week or ten days -- My Father & George will remain here till about the 12 th & then meet us in London the House will scarcely be finished before then , as the plaistering & painting is not to be begun upon till next Monday -- if you were here now you would think us very comfortable A for we have at last hit upon the only plan that can make us so in cold weather , we have left the Drawingroom entirely , & are settled in the Saloon with two fires & a large screen to divide the room so as to dine at one end , & sit at the other -- we are now totally separated , for I am writing here very comfortably & uninterrupted by the conversation of the Gentlemen whom we have left to their wine & their conversation at the opposite end of the room -- when you write again , which I hope will be soon , I flatter myself it will be more in detail , & that you will give me some of your journey , Louisa , your own health , Mr Dickenson s & of the State of things at Taxal , not omitting what may be the probabilities of your coming to Town in the Spring -- I have had no return of the pain in my Breast & am to take a quarter of an ounce of Bark wth 5 Gr . of long Pepper every day for six Months to come without ever omitting it -- adieu my dear Friend we all desire to be remembered to Mr D -- & Bell begs her love to you -- pray direct your next to St James 's -- adieu ever y affecly & sincerely yours C.M .
