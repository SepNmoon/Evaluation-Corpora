27 Novbr continued . Miſs —— the Honble- —— told me of such a conversation of Miſs Luttrell 's -- the Ducheſs of Cumberland 's Sister , that I quite detest her , it was little short of Treason -- Politics are ever an improper convers ation Topic for a Woman -- but how highly improper for her -- The Duke is a very weak man , & by having connected himself with a sensible daring set is led by them -- I say no more , but I trust you will ever be upon your guard & not aſsociate with such a Crew . I do not much admire Miss S B -- I think it is only in ye . common stile of novels & I should throw it aside if you had not lent it to me --
