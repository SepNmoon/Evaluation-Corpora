24 th . 25 th - June 1781 Madam Feeling as I do , attach 'd to Your Majesty by every sentiment of gratitude & personal affection , I find it very difficult to summons resolution sufficient to acquaint You with what I am but too conscious would be dishonorable to delay longer , nor could I answer to myself , the indulgence of remaining in a situation , merely to have the happineſs & honor of approaching You -- & which indeed has been my sole motive for some time past . I am , Madam , every day more & more sensible that I am by no means equal to the situation I have the honor to be in , on many accounts , but particularly , from the delicacy of my constitution , as it from time , to time , prevents my paying the proper and required attendance on their Royal Highneſs 's , and , I know my spirits are , from the same cause , inadequate to a constant exertion ; I therefore most humbly intreat Your Majesty will take into consideration to find some other person more worthy & able to supply my place ; till that is done , Your Majesty may depend on my continuing to fulfill my duty to the utmost of my abilities . As this determination proceeds from the most dis-interested & honorable motive , I am fully persuaded I rest secure on Your Majest y ies will have too much goodneſs that you will goodneſs & candor to not dis ap prove my quitting Your Service ; & I beg leave to be allow 'd to add , that I shall ever retain the liveliest gratitude for the many marks of gracious attention & condescend ing sion ing goodneſs regard wch- You Madam -- have so often favor 'd shewn Your Majesti es most Dutiful most Faithful , & most Dutiful most Respectful Servant ; Mary Hamilton .
