My dear Miranda -- I owe you a Letter , but I am not so idle as to wan need that consideration , & I love you so sincerely that I could write to you at all times with pleasure -- I was happy to see a few lines of Yours last Sunday & I hope we shall have more before we leave Mapledurham . We had the pleasure of meeting my dear Fanny well -- & of finding all our friends well so , little George very much improved he looks quite robust & healthy & is fat & lively enough , he is really a very pretty fellow , much more resembles Pappa than Mamma . I long to hear of Mrs. Hamilton , she promised her maid should write , but has not yet given us any account . I am going to write to Mrs : Glover & will beg of her to infor tell me how your Mamma does : I know she sees her frequently I wish we had not been absent from her just at present -- I am in hopes we shall find her very much amended ; It gave me , my dear , great pleasure to see you in such good spirits in James Street I expect to see you at St : James 's quite au fait en tout . I expect that you will let me breakfast with you ; often -- & so let me at least begin some happy days , in the Winter -- What an alteration must a Year probably make to me -- I shall see our Caterina settled within that time , & by that time , I shall be certain whether she will be happier than with us -- I think she will be so -- our way through this life is neceſsarily perplexed & our supports , are weak , & few -- the married state , combining the interests & strength of two in one , gives aſsurance & comfort to both -- I agree with you that Caterina will still be yours and mine it is not poſsible that you should lose her . I think I can not lose her . We will derive new happineſs from hers . I imagine you have seen , -- or will soon see our dear Leonidas -- he loves you -- with all the affection you can desire , & with all the esteem you deserve -- this I can not estimate . He has a great share in my Heart , there are but a few of whom I can say this You forgot to send me Virgil -- & I minded your not remembering it more then the loſs of the Entertainment -- but I have got the Adventurer which I am agreeably entertained with . What do you read ? -- I know your reading is often of the serious kind . We are happy here -- we walk or ride every day -- I take delight in long Walks through Woods -- & Vales -- & I think no Hill too steep to climb which rewards me with a view -- here are Scenes , worthy any Pencil , this is indeed one of the most beautiful Countries I have seen . I wish you were with me to give me your Sentiments of it . My Sister Barnard sends her best Compts . to you . Miſs B hers -- Bell her Love , Mr. Barnard j unites with them . I am my dear Miranda always the Same -- & Yours . A C Maple-durham Oct . 28 th -- 1778 To Miſs Hamilton
