Mrs . Fielding after Mother illness My dear Miſs Hamilton My sincere concern for your distreſs prevented my writing at the time that some doubt & so much anxiety & fatigue accompanied it , as I know how painful an addition to so trying a state the having to answer or even excuse to answer the officious kindneſses of ones friends often proves -- but now that I find you are so rightly though I 'm sure so painfully exerting yourself so far as to see some of those who love & feel for you I can not forbear as I must not be of that number to expreſs by Letter how much I have grieved for you -- every comfort that your excellent principles can afford you this melancholy case will I trust admit of , you have every reason to think the change a bleſsed one for her you mourn for , & the more entirely & resignedly you can submit to so painful a trial for yourself the greater must be ye . future reward and consolation . -- I hope you have Miſs Clark as much as poſsible with you -- my str . was quite charmed with her sweet & friendly behaviour -- adieu my dr . Miſs H . & believe me ever most truly Yrs . S. Feilding Burley Decr . 7 th . 1778
