Stilton , 11 th . March 1783 . My Dear Sister , I am arrived here safe , but not quite so rich as when I left London . To make the matter as short as poſsible , I was stopped & robbed last Night about Seven O'Clock by two Highwaymen who took my Watch , gold Chain & Seals & my Servants Watch . Fortunately we had only a few Shillings in our Pockets , & they did not perceive ( owing to the Dusk ) my strong Box at the bottom of the Chaise in which was £47 in Cash -- They likewise took a pair of Pistols out of the front pocket which were unloaded , but had the pistols even been loaded the attack was too sudden to take them out of their Cases . My loſs all together amounts to very near £55 -- The good Old Lady lamented my Misfortune , but did not administer any solid Comfort . Your pocket Book was in their hands but they returned it , taking it I presume for a Bible . I left Tewin Water this afternoon & hope to sleep at York tomorrow . Adieu . Ever your sincere friend & Affectionate Brother N——
