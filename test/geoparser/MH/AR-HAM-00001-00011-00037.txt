Stan . St : Novr : 30 . Although my Eyes are still weak , I must indulge myself in writing a few Lines to you , my Dear Friend , in ansr : to the most kind & tendre Letter I received from you some time ago . Ly . Cremorne indeed wrote for me , which Letter I hope you have received , but yet I long to tell you with my own Hand how grateful it was to My poor sad Heart to receive your sympathy , & that of your Dear Husband , & his Worthy Father & Sisters : pray thank them for me , & for my poor dr : afflicted Husband ; for he is sensible as I am of their kind C ompaſsion . You will bleſs God with me , my Dear Friend , that he has in his great Mercy wonderfully supported us under these trying & tender Afflictions -- such as at a Distance I should have thought must have sunk us to the Dust ; but God Almighty has given us resignedgnation to his all wise Dispensations -- & tho ' He cause Trouble , we do not Sorrow as those without hope : Our sweet Angels are I humbly trust in Peace & Happineſs , where the “ Wicked cease from Troubling , “ & the Weary be at rest ; ” Job 3:17 -- had They lived some years , The Wicked might have sullied their sweet Souls , & then their poor dr : Father & I sd.- have have been wretched , at present we are only sorrowful -- & tho ' we now “ sow in Tears ” Psalm 126:5 , I humbly trust if we bear Fruit in our hour of Calamity Affliction , do our duty as long as God sees good to give us Life , we shall , through his Mercy , “ reap in Joy ” Psalm 126:5 . I have been some Mornings at Chelsea , & bore it better than I expected tho ' it is w as sadly sweet to me . my poor Husband has walked ther e on ce . I will now say no more myself than that I am sadly grieved Dr.- Lady Louisa Clayton does not spend this Winter in Town -- it wd : have been a very great Comfort to me ; but I hope to see her for a few Days soon , that will be a great gratification . to me poor Ly : Wake is greatly afflicted with the Headach -- I fear it is Gout . Sr : Wm : when he was in Town gave me a very good Account of Mr : Antrobus 's Behaviour , at College , which I rejoiced to hear . Poor young Man ! -- I mean Sr : Wm : The sad Scene he kindly went through here ( for he staid by my Dear Child 's Bedside 'till the last momen t of his precious Life ) has sadly shaken his Nerves & Spirits -- but I hope when he gets Pupils at Cambridge he will be better . I hope very sincerely that you yr worthy Husband , & yr : sweet little Child are well -- & the rest of the Family . I shall be very happy to see yr : little Dear -- may She be a Bleſsing to you & reward yr : anxious Cares . Mr. Antrobus begs his kind Love to you & Joins me in kind wishes & best Comps : to Ld.- C : . believe me Ever yrs : most Affly : Mr : Dickinson I am happy to hear yr : Eyes are recovered . but do n't use them to much .
