My Dear Miſs Hamilton Nobody can be more Sensible than I am of all your kind Attentions to me , nor set a higher Value on the Motive of them , wch . is the Goodneſs of yr heart ; the greatest mark of kindneſs you can shew me , is to take care of yourself , by wch . means I shall the sooner have an the Opportunity of renewing the happy Connexion in wch . we are engaged . I mention 'd to their Majesties to day , yr Regret about being deprived so long from attending yr Duty , they both exprest great Concern that you had suffer 'd so much , & hopes that you wd . do every thing to re-establish yr health that was neceſsary , & seem 'd to think the going out of Town a very proper Step towards it , when you was able to do it . The Princeſses all send their Love . & now my dear I must repeat that I can not bear you shd . be uneasy abt . my Attendance ; this Evening I shall have , as Miſs Goldsworthy is above Stairs to day , & as to the future Ones , I shall flatter myself I have not many more of my two weekly pay to lose , as very probably Pſs Augusta 's Stay in the Country may not be long . She is vastly well & Sets out tomorrow at 12 o'Clock , Pſs Mary & Mrs Cheveley wth . Miſs Goldsworthy make the Partie quarrée . believe me Ever most Affly . Yrs . C.Finch To Miſs Hamilton
