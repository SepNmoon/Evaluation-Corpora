My dear Cousin , I am anxious to know how you all do , and whether you have escaped inundation during the uncommon weather we have had . It has suspended my journey to Bath ; for the accounts thence , and of the roads in general , are tremendous . I have , thank God , experienced no illneſs nor inconvenience ; but am in deep concern at present , for the loſs of General Anstruther , with whom I was acquainted , and who married a friend and near relation of mine : she is left with five little ones , to deplore this dreadful misfortune . The recent events of war , have been most calamitous . Every one must poignantly lament Sir John Moore : I was not acquainted with him , but am , with some of his family : they are all ( as you may suppose ) overwhelmed with grief -- his poor Mother , in particular . I heard lately from my dear Father -- he is tolerably well . I purpose visiting him when the weather will permit . -- I am extremely comfortable in my little Apartments , which I have now had a trial of , both in heat and cold ; for the Summer , you may remember , was intense , and so , I am sure , has been the Winter . I have got my Piano-Forte ; but have not made any great use of it yet , as of late , there has been no stirring from the fire . Àpropos to fire -- what terrible conflagrations have occurred this Winter -- I think I never remember so many in the same space of time -- Covent Garden Theatre , S t : James 's Palace , an Hotel and two or three other houses in Conduit Street , & c. & c. -- The Theatre is rebuilding , and , it is said , will be ready to open in September next ; of the poſsibility of which , I have my doubts ; but suppose that those who make the assertion know more of the matter than I . I have seen by the papers ( and so have you no doubt ) that the Trial of Ly : E. B . & Mr. H——y is over . There was not much said in the paper I saw , which I was glad of ; but I think the Damages were shamefully light . -- My Sister has got a House in Merrion Square , Dublin , for the Winter . I conclude she will not come to England , this season . I should think it better avoided , at this period . -- I hope to receive good accounts of you , Mr : Dickenson , and my Cousin Louisa . Have you any idea of London , for this Spring ? I flattered myself the Leſsons in music would be an inducement ; but I find she has had them in the Country : however the re are such various attractions beside , that I still , rather believe you will come . Tell me your opinion upon the subject ; and believe me , with kindest regards to Mr : Dickenson and my Cousin , your sincerely obliged & affectionate Jane Holman . 50 Mortimer Street London Feb : 4 th : 1809 P.S .
