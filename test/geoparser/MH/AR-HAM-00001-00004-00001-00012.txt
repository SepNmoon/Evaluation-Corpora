Dear Miſs Hamilton , From your very kind and affectionate attention to me upon every occasion during my stay in London , I am certain it will give you pleasure to hear that I am arrived safe in Dublin without having suffer 'd from the very severe weather on my journey and a rough paſsage ; I arrived here early on Saturday morning , and within an an hour or two of the time that I was expected ; as you are a person of no small sensibility , you can judge of the satisfaction I felt in being returned to my family after so long an absence . I am certain you discover 'd an impatience which ought to have been conceal 'd , for it was certainly a strange return for your aſsiduous attention to me , which was indeed very different from what I experienced from every other quarter . Tho ' I can not flatter myself with the idea that the object of my visit to England has been answer 'd as I cou 'd have wish 'd , yet I aſsure you I have receiv 'd ample compensation for all the trouble it has given me . There was no posſibility of convincing my Friends here that with such ostensible family connections it cou 'd require any thing more than my appearance amongst them to unite them in my service . It was impoſsible to explain difficulties to them , it was easier for me to make an attempt from which I had no great hopes of succeſs , than to suffer the constant reproach of indolence & of being of an helpleſs disposition . You know my situation precisely , it is therefore unneceſsary to tire you with any further detail or explanation . This Country is disposed to be perfectly satisfied with what has been done for them , but there are clandestine attempts by Persons in England to create new difficulties in which it is generally supposed they will be disappointed . When you do me the favour of writing pray remember to enclose a frank or two for my letters are not worth the postage . Mrs. Hamilton & Mrs. Stratford desire to be affectionately rememberd to you I am Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Sackville Street , Dublin Jany . 31 st 1780
