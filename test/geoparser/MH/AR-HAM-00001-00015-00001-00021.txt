St James 's May 10 th . Since I received your letter my dear Friend , till this minute I have scarce been able to hold a Pen . I have been almost distracted with a return of the pain in my face , which however thank God , has now left me entirely . How I feel for you my dear Friend ! I so well know , how you must be affected by the melancholy accident you mention & by its still more melancholy consequences -- what they may have been by this time , I dread to ask -- you say Mr D . was then dangerously ill. What has been the Event -- has God spared him to you -- is he recovering ? I am very anxious indeed to hear -- let me have one word from you my dear , if poſsible . should you be at this minute in need of consolation you will find it , in Religion ; in your own good sens e in your strong reason , in each other , in that affectio n & regard , which will induce & enable you to exert yourselves mutually for each other 's sakes -- I will say nothi n g on the subject , my attempts would be in vain , I will only aſsure you that I am deeply interested in your situation . The account you give of your dear little Louisa , & I like her names extremely , is charming indeed -- what a happineſs to be the Mother of such a little Being , a little Angel , which attaches & interests more and more every day -- & which already must prove the greatest of comfort , to you . I have little to tell you about myself , I am just now very well after having been distracted wth the pain in my face most of the winter -- I am grown very thin , look pale & should not please you at all by my appearance . I thank God , that I am going in three weeks into the Country , where , little as I rake & sit up here , I shall be still more quiet & regular -- I know not whether it is not even more fatigui n g to the spirits & mind to hear a noise & bustle on all sides of you when you do not enter into it yourself than when you are foremost in the riot -- this is very much my case , I go very little into publick , & have God knows still leſs interest in what is goi n g on , but I am etourdie with the arrangements plans & diſsappointments of others . On the 6 th of June I intend carryi n g my Sister down to Horton where I stay till the next Drawingroom -- I return here for that Day & in a few days afterwards go for two Months -- it is impoſsible to tell what comfort & relief I feel from this idea , it makes enables me to bear the short time I must remain here longer , with patience -- I have already made a list of Books & musick I shall take down & amuse myself with formi n g a plan of reading & occupation -- my Father left us last Tuesday he is established at Horton where he is maki n g great alterations both in the House & Grounds . I am going to new paper my room , with white & next year shall afford new curtains & chairs . we have a whole swarm of french People here who are all going to Bath on Monday -- The Ducheſs de Poligniac ( the quondam favourite ) is a very pretty Woman , very short but with the most pleasing countenance & manners -- The Ducheſs de Guiche her Daughter who has been married but two years & is but 15 -- is still shorter but pretty tho ' with a very high forehead , she is reckoned the prettie st woman at Paris , but we have hundreds here who excell her infinitly -- we had a great Ball at the French Ambaſsadors on Thursday ( for I was interrupted in my letter , & it is now Saturday ) at which I was -- it was a very gay & pretty Ball , too numerous to make the dancing pleasant , I came home very early -- what I expect great pleasure from is the Play at Richmond House to which the King & Queen go on Thursday next I am invited by the Duke , so is all the family , but we do not attend the Queen , & go undreſsed -- it is the way to keep him , you have seen the Papers full of it , it has been acted 5 times & every body seems delighted with it -- adieu my dear dear Friend , I must leave you for my Sister calls me to walk -- God bleſs you -- & may this find you all happy & comfortable again -- I wish for everythi n g that may contribute to make you so -- remember me to Mr D . adieu God bleſs you -- ever yours CMG -- To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire Honble Miſs Gunning June 1787
