Buxton X 3 d page Canterbury Octr 2 d - 1772 I was made happy My dear Mary by getting yours of the 26 - 7 last night & can only ſay the more of them that comes to me the more pleaſure I receive as every thing from your fair fingers must be delightfull , but whatsoever was the reaſon of my not hearing from you , is not belonging to me to inquire as the honor you do me in writing at all shall be always looked upon by me with the greatest gratitude . However My dearest Miſs Hamilton may be perswaded that the Races was a time no Person had a right to break in upon , but Pray who was the happy Man that danced & entertained you so much as not to tire you even at 4 or 5 o'Clock in the morning he must have been very agreeable indeed & I should be monstrously jealous had I not got yours wrote the very day after the Races as I should have been tempted to have done you the injustice to have thought that this agreeable Orontes had made the Fair Caſsandra even give up her friends but I am now quite satisfied that whatsoever Caſsandra might have done for Orontes , My agreeable Friend will not give up the friendship I flatter myself she has for me , on any account , & on my part I am reſolved never to give up mine for her . That point being settled I shall go on in anſwering yours -- Be aſsured I do n't care a farthing under what derection your letter comes to me provided it be one that brings them ſafe thats all my concern & the last came just as ſafe as the former ones -- I have had two letters from Lord Cathcart since he got to London , he writes only a few lines being greatly hurried abt Buſineſs which I dare ſay is the reaſon you have not heard from him I derect for him at London & they find their way to him but I can inform you of nothing elſe but that he & family were well two days ago For God ſake My dearest Girl write me no Latin epistle , much leſs a Greek one the very sight of either now wd- certainly kill me , even a quotation of either gives my Nerves ſuch a tremor that makes me uncapable to move for a week -- so from the above epistles Good Lord deliver me , but write as many & as much as you please in English which is a language much better adapted for our correspondance & indeed now to my Capacity , as the trouble & pains in anſwering , as well as reading them , would be much more than I am capable off -- I will allow all you ſay but I dont believe any language or any other thing can give My dearest Miſs Hamilton s virtues a higher Polish or make them more conspicuous than they are already at least in my opinion , as they certainly are not in the rude uncultivated state you are pleased to call them -- I have not ſeen Miſs Carter as yet not having been at Deal where she lives with her Father , but she is very well as I see her Brother ſome times indeed his Wife having been so ill wt the Gout ( tho a Woman abt . twenty five ) has been the occaſion that I have never as yet ventured to ride the Sixteen Miles that divides us -- I am extremely glad the Kitten is so much better as for being tired of Br & ſr- I believe she was pretty much so before I left you as least I thought so , nay could take my Bible Oath on it , I wish she was to try Buxton now -- apropos I hope you remember your engagement of going there next spring tell Mrs- Hamilton with best wishes & Compts- that I shall not let her off on any Account and as I 'll have you on my ſide I make no doubt but she will be ready to sett out as ſoon as I get to Northampton to escort you ſafely thro the high Mountains of Derbyshire -- you want to know what new acquaintances I have made , anſwer none , being quite well known to every body here that I should wish to be known too , ſome if poſsible I would willingly drop , but ſome times we must take the bad to come at the Good which is my case in many places that I go too & should I say this place is excepted I should most certainly entertain you with a Canterbury tale -- your Purse My dear Mary is my Constant companion never out of my Pocket but when its in my hand & it never fails reminding me of my dear Friend Miſs Hamilton * . This place is famous for Brawn , which with Mrs- Hamilton s permiſsion when the time comes I propose sending her a Collar of it -- You ſay that your greatest wish is the perpetual continuance of my Friendship believe me My dearest Mary you have it in the greatest degree & my greatest happineſs will be to be to be indulged with yours in the ſame way -- I must now give over as ſome Gentlemen are comed to me about buſineſs otherwise I did deſign to have wrote out this Sheet as I have no greater pleaſure than in chatting in this way with you when I am debarred the more substantial one of yr Company Adieu My dearest Mary write ſoon & believe me Yours most Affct for ever * Dont think I need the Purse for to put me in mind of you , very far from it , but the truth is every thing that comes from you makes me happy to look at so once more My dearest Girl Adieu
