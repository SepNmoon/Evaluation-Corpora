both going to London Edinburgh March 9 th - 1774 The morning after I was favored with My Dear Ward s letter I saw Mr Brown who I scolded not a little but he has been so buſy in election matters & indeed so has all the men of buſineſs in Scotland that we who have no buſineſs that way can get not one word of them , but he promised me to write you this week & satisfy all your demands so I hope by the time you get this , you 'll be packing up for the great Ci t y where reigns nonſenſe noise hurry & impertinance in absolute Authority & without the least controle as long as Money holds out . Apropos to Money I am happy you are so flush . Patch Cloe & Fairry , quite a family peice Fanshon should most certainly have been included to have made the peice complete together with the Birds in the back parlour wh- would have made a Capital painting just arrived from Rome done by the best hand in that best of poſsible City 's . So My dear Mary thought I had forgot her too , no there is no fear of that when you act up to that good sense I know you Mistriſs off & if that should ever fail I shall be more angry with myself than with you to be so taken in & disappointed in my opinion of you . So Mr Brown disappointed your Mama and not in the least her Daughter , no , no , it was Mrs Hamilton that wanted to go to London not Miſs Hamilton . do you remember the picture in the Corner yea or nay . But be aſsured you need not make any Apology for any thing in my power to serve either You or Your Mama .
