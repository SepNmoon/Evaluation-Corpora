Bath -- August 6 th : 1787 . My dear Miſs Hamilton -- I shou 'd have done myself the Pleasure of answering your Letter sooner , but that I have been in a good Deal of Hurry , lately , which you will easily believe , when I tell you , that my Mother suddenly took the Resolution of coming with me , to Bath : she had long wish 'd me to drink the Bath Waters ; not for any Material Indisposition ; only on account of my now and then , having a little Head-Ach , which she says , is bilious . My Father remain 'd in London , because of our new House ; which we expect to get into , at Michaelmas . My Mother and I , have been here upwards of a Fortnight , and propose staying five Weeks longer -- It is a Time of the Year , at which we can more conveniently be absent from London , than at that which is call 'd the Bath Season . Nothing can agree with me better than drinking the Waters , and bathing . I wrote to Mrs : Dickenson a Day or two , ago -- You ask me , how I like her Choice ? I think Mrs : Halsey has all the Appearance of being a very good- natur 'd Man ; and one whose Disposition is suited to Mr : Halsey 's -- I did not know that Mrs : Halsey was not delighted with him . My Sister is not gone to Naples -- she had thoughts of doing so ; not on account of her Health , but because Miſs A—— C—— ( having got into some Difficulties , ) wish 'd to break up House-keeping ; and live with his Brother -- he therefore , suggested it to Mr : Stratford , to go abroad with her three Children , to remain for perhaps a few Years ; in which Time he hop 'd to get out of his Embaraſsments . Naples was the Place fix 'd upon ; but as her Father and Mother , and Friends , did not think it an eligible one , she gave up the Thoughts o f it an d went into the Neighbourhood of Ge neva where she has now been , I think , about two M onths . she is in Company with a Family of great respectability , who went with her from Dublin , on a Plan of Oeconomy . I saw Mrs : Stratford pretty often last Winter : not as often in private as I cou 'd have wish 'd ; owing partly to her numerous Occupations , and partly ( I am sorry to say , ) to her being frequently indispos 'd . She does not act all this Summer , by which Precaution I hope she will have a good Winter . She was to paſs some Time with Mrs : Siddons and Lord ; and to spend the Remainder of her Summer , in various Visits . I hope you will come to London in the Spring , and shew us your pretty Daughter , who I am delighted to hear , has happily got over the Small-Pox -- you may now reckon her Beauty safe , you know . We hear from my Father frequently , who always gives us the Pleasure of hearing that Lady Harcourt is well . My Mother 's Compts : attend you and Robert , to whom I beg mine also . -- Adieu , my dear Cousin , believe me yours sincerely -- Mr : Dickenson . P.S . We saw J : Hamilton a short Time before we left Town , & she was very well . Mrs : Walkinshaw Taxal Derbyshire Cheshire . Supposed -- Near Macclesfield
