Vise died at Stoke in Childbed -- I sincerely pity her poor father -- she was his only Child . I went to bed before 11 she has left 2 Children . I went to bed before 11 o'clock that good for nothing being Mr. Coupland came again this Eveg . he sent another letter a few days ago . he is so wicked , that it would be wrong to give him any thing as he wd . make an improper use of any money one could give him & he wd . accept of no other relief . -- had a good account of Mrs. Johnston , that one of my old Chairman who look 'd dying & c & c .

How shall I ever repay the goodneſs of so many kind friends as I am bleſs 'd with ? I think myself the most fortunate of human beings -- those to whom I give the Title of dear Friends are people of the most excellent characters & best principles -- I am by their example encouraged to persevere in Virtue & guard myself from folly & vice . & c . I poſseſs the heart of an amiable Man whom I love , & whom I have ever preferred to every other -- I not only ought to be but I can truly say I am most grateful to Providence . it is a duty these beautiful lines of Addison better express my gratitude than any thing I can say -- Thy bounteous hand w th . worldly bliss Has made my Cup run o'er And in a kind & faithful friend Had doubled all my store Ten thousand thousand precious gifts My daily thanks employ ; Nor is the least , a cheerful heart , That tastes those gifts wth . joy . Through every period of my life Thy goodneſs I 'll pursue And after death in distant Worlds The glorious theme renew .

Miſs I found her in the Library writing to Relation 's to acquaint them of Lady S—— 's being brought to bed -- She told me she wrote ye . first letter to me yesterday to me -- but Lord S—— wd . not let her send it as he had writ ing ten himself . Miſs Murray told me she had seen Lady Stormont this Morng . & that she & ye . dear babe were charming well . -- She promised to give my love to Lord & Lady S—— . she goes back to Ken-Wood but is to come to Town every Morng .

Mrs. Williams -- was suitably married to a Gentleman of good fortune . it was a match of inclination & they were mutually happy , a few short years only she enjoy 'd the society of her amiable Husband -- let ye . feeling heart judge what she felt when one Morning ( without any previous illneſs ) she found him lying dead by her side . for 12 Years she shut herself up from all society , only admitting ye . Visits of her nearest Relations -- the last 12 Years she has receivd some of her old friends & now & then pays them a visit -- but lives in a retired manner -- abt . 10 Miles from London -- her principal amusement is the care of her Garden & the study of Botany She has a handsome independency & lives in stile suitable to an elegant mind -- without parade -- every thing about her is neat as her dreſs , & proper as her manner . Never having been bleſs 'd with Children -- she took a Brothers Daughter to live wth . her -- the Young Lady I saw -- who appears as if she would do credit to her Aunt . Miſs Capper seems to be abt . 16. not handsome , but looks Modest & civil . Mrs. Betty Granville a Cousin of Mrs. Delany s succeeded Mrs. W .

Picture she is blind to it -- of course her descriptions are pleasing to all those to like to contemplate only ye . most beautiful objects for she has ye . art of describ ing so well that You see all the objects of her sometimes poetic Fancy . After having given me an Account of Mr. Vesey s fine Place in Ireland -- she gave me the following lines to read -- I read them aloud & I was much pleased to see ye . tear of sensibility steal down Mr. Vesey s cheek .. In Mr Vesey s beautiful Grounds at Lucan near Dublin he had placed an Obelisk . Mrs. Vesey walking with him one day & looking on it , expreſsed a Wish that she might be burried Under it & that when he died he wd . be laid in the same grave . he immediately took out his pencil & wrote thise lines & giving them to her said he wd . comply wth . her request & that should be their Epitaph Near this fair sculpture sleeps a pair In Church yard his'try wondrous rare , Who liked the busy hum of Men , Then joy 'd to see their fields again , Who dreſs 'd ye . Grove , or led ye . Rill , To shine and bable down ye . Hill , Who Nature felt , & void of art Gave to ye . poor , & good , their heart , Who lov 'd when young , yet died old friends A bleſsing fate but seldom sends . Mr : & Mrs : V : are Cousins -- they were attach 'd to each other from their cradles -- Mr. V early hoped to be united to ye . object of his heart -- but Mrs. Vesey was forced to ye . Altar at 15 by the arbitary will of an arbitary Father who obliged her to marry a disagreeable old Man -- she was beautiful -- & he in his 70 th - Year was too much captivated to reject a forced consent -- the only excuse ye . father had for sacrificing his daughter was , that ye . Gentleman was his friend & he had given his honor to give him his Child in marriage -- this Man lived some Years during wch . time -- Mrs. V . behaved irreproachably -- when he had been dead a Year -- Mr. Vesey 's constancy was rewarded by her .

Mrs. Vesey & I had a long argument relative to the education of Women -- Mr. Vesey & Mrs. Handcock were on my side Miſs Clarke as usual was dumb & what was more mortifying she did not seem even to listen to our debate . after amusing ourselves for an hour & half , for we were very friendly opponents we left ye . dining Room -- as I did not chuse Coffee & Mrs. V . has the happy art of making her guests feel under no constraint . I came home to endulge myself in the luxury of being quiet & alone for an hour . I read one of Blair s Sermons & wrote out a letter of Miſs H. More 's to Mrs : Vesey wch . she had given me .
