Dear Madam In answer to your letter with the enclosed which has perhaps given you some uneasineſs , you are to understand that it is a swindling piece of busineſs in which your name has been made use of to defraud some credulous fool , your real Christian name has been purposely avoided to prevent a prosecution for a forgery . I thought it a propriety to apprise Sir Robt . Herries 's Cashier of the intended fraud , it seems the Bill was presented at his House by a Woman on Saturday last but he refused payment , he informed me at the same time that he was certain money had been received upon it ; you can do nothing in this busineſs but remain quiet without giving yourself the smallest uneasineſs , I do not think you will receive any further letter upon the subject , if you shou 'd I wou 'd recommend it to you to transmit to Mr. Jackson your Attorney , who will know how to act in case any thing shoud be neceſsary to be done . As for myself I wou 'd by no means appear to Mr. Berger the dupe or any of the party . If any Person cou 'd be so weak to advance money upon the Draft of a Persons without being acquainted with their writing or Christian names he is not to be pitied . This is supposing Berger an innocent Person , but even that is doubtful , a little time will clear up the whole matter which at all events can be of no serious consequence to you . We have lost our worthy Friend Mr. Glover who died early on Friday morning last ; we have made the proper inquiries after Mrs . & Miſs Glover but are as yet ignorant in what manner he has left his property , but I am not uneasy upon that subject as I am certain he poſseſs 'd an excellent disposition , I confeſs I feel myself sincerely interested for poor Miſs Glover , & I am certain I shall not be disappointed I beg to be rememberd to Mr. Dickenson & remain Dear Mrs. Dickenson Your faithful & Affect . Humble ser vant Frederick Hamilton Bedford Square Novr . 26 th . 1786 . P.S . Mrs. Stratford has been with us on her return from Paris & staid only 8 days , she is now on her way to Dublin . I made the explanation you desir 'd . Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Cheshire
