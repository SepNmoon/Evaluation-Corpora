Chelsea Thurs Fri day Morning 19 Octbr- 1781 My Dearest Miſs Hamilton I have been so Ill since I sent to you last , that I have not been able to hold down my Head to write you , more than a Line , & that would not content me , when I had so much to say , & so much to ask ; -- I do not know where to begin , but you see what a Sheet of paper I have prepared ; & you must read , it , at different times , for I must write you a Folio . I have had so violent a Cold in my head , & Eyes , that I was advi se d to keep all the Mornings in Bed , & then during the night , I had just the sort of Cough , ( wh : I do believe nervous ) that I had last Spring , -- but by keeping warm , & very quiet , I am a vast deal better ; & am nursing up to be able to pay my Duty , ( which I hope nothing will hinder my doing , next Thursday ( I mean y e the 25 th ) to her Majesty ) I yesterday bought my Gown , & I shall be ready to cry , if I am not able to go to Court on that Day : so much for my worthleſs self , now my Dear Miſs Hamilton what can we say for the Queen 's gracious Notice of our Son ? -- I was quite frightened to think of it , till I told myself over & over again , that the same goodneſs which led her Majesty to send for him , would make allowances for wh atever was wanting in his Behaviour & manner . do pray ( tho ' I am frightened to ask it , ) let me know how he behaved . I am afraid very aukwardly , or I think you would have sent me a Line to tell me , for you must know how anxious I must have been about him ; poor Soul ! he aſsured me he behaved as well as he could , but he said , he was afraid his Boots made him make a sad noise , & hindered him from walking out of the Room as well as he otherwise should have done ; I then pictured him up , stamping along like the Chat botté ; he told us that the Queen desired he might learn to fence , which would open his Chest ; this he was so delighted with , that every Day , Lord Dartrey has been asked when He was to begin to learn -- & this Morning ; M r : I forgot the Name who attends one of the Schools at Chelsea is has been sent for , to come tomorrow : nothing can be more grateful than Lord Dartrey & I are for this , & every Mark , of the Queen 's goodneſs , & I beg you to aſsure Her Majesty so , with our humble Duty ; & If Thomas behaved in any manner with Impropiety , & want of due Attention or Respect , I trust her Majesty 's goodneſs will pardon it in a Child . unused to such an Honor as being admitted into the Presence of the King & Queen . He , as is very natural , talks of little else , -- & yesterday I was much diverted by hearing him & little Mast : Macartney , ( who had the Honor of being marked out to the King by Admiral Parker ) ( Capt : Macartney was killed in the Engagement . ) Thomas giving an account to each other of the Honours They had received : I must tell you , what I am sure will move your heart as much as it did mine -- when the Purser of the Ship came to tell the poor little Boy of his Father 's being killed , he fell down upon his Knees , & lifted up his Hands , & after crying bitterly , He said -- “ Good God ! take care of my Mother “ & Sisters ; my Father was a brave man , & he is gone to “ Heaven ! -- & I can go to Sea again . ” -- They say there was not a Sailor that did not shed Tears . I think I never heard any thing more pathetic , & or that bespoke a more manly Spirit at the same time : you will think it a great g G ain , and do , for My Son to have such a Companion , He generally dines with him every Sunday & Thursday ; -- I was led to tell you this interesting Story , when I was just going to beg you to present my Duty to The Princeſs Royal , & Princeſs Augusta for their goodneſs to Thomas , & for the Beautiful Present he brought me from their Royal Highneſses : It is still blooming , as much of it , as care & fresh Water would preserve ; & Julia has some of the Rose Leaves & pink leaves dried , in her little History of England , which She had as a Reward for learning the Dates , & Lines by heart . She is now learning King Stephen , & She repeats it like with such tones , & so ridiculous an Air , that it is difficult to keep ones Countenance -- I am vastly happy to hear Her Majesty & Prince Alfred are recovered . -- We have a House full of Colds Lord D . & both the Children -- I hope you escape & that Miſs Goldsworthy continues well . Thursday Eveng : -- I was not able to finish & send this yesterday I tried what taking the Air would do for my stupid Head & your Friend Mr. Glover came here , whilst I was out -- He came in & saw what was better looking at than me & left word that he was pretty well -- Adieu I must again repeat how sensibly we feel the Honor done our Son , by their Majesty s gracious Condescension , & the Princeſses goodneſs to him -- Adieu I am sure you will send me a Line in return to my Letter -- Lord D begs his kind love & believe me ever Yrs : very Affly : PDartrey Mrs : Fielding is I hear safely Landed , but I have not yet heard from Her , wh : I wonder at , as She could have writ from Falmouth -- I fear Dr : Ly : Charlotte 's will be a tedious Journey -- I have been so disappointed about Mrs : F : I shall not quite believe She is come 'till I see her , it is so odd She has not sent me one Line , as She knew She cd : not come so soon as the post cd- bring me a Letter . once more Adieu -- pray write me one Line about Thos : I hope he did not disgrace you -- he said you took him into the Queen 's Room .
