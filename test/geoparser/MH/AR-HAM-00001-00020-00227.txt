71 , Queen Street 12 th - Decr- 1808 My Dear Sister , Your puzzle s remains unravelled , and your paper uncut into four equal parts . The former , I attempted ; but , after counfounding it , & myself , a little , I threw it aside . Though descended from a great Mathematician , I do not feel myself equal to divide the Paper according to your directions , & therefore , shall now deliver over both the Torments to my Girls , to try their ingenuity . By the bye , it occasioned no little Astonishment at my Breakfast Table , when these puzzles were produced . “ Dear Mamma , “ ( said my Daughter Anne ) , how differently “ Papa must behave in England , from “ what he does here , that it should ever “ enter into anybody 's head to send him “ puzzles ! ! ! . ” What Idea she at that Moment formed of the Liberty you had taken with her Papa 's Dignity , I leave You to judge ; but , her astonishment shews You , in what good Discipline I keep my Wife & Brats . It would be well for some folks , if they would follow my Example . My Boys were both well , when I heard from them last . William had rejoined his Ship ( the Imperieuse ) and was just preparing to sail after the Frigates , which had escaped from Toulon , and were supposed to have put into a Corsican Port . Francis , is at present , at Portsmouth , where the Resistance is undergoing some repair , having suffered from the Storms she met with , in a six Weeks paſsage from Lisbon . My eldest daughter has been for these some weeks past in Perthshire , endeavouring to comfort Lady Eliz . MacGregor Murray , for the loſs of her husband , who lately went to Spain , with the 15 th . L . Dragoons . Lady Elizabeth is to paſs her Christmas , at Dunkeld , & Sir John M. Murray escorts my daughter home tomorrow . My Carriage is just gone to meet them halfway . The rest of Us , have been stationary here , for some Months . past . Of my own intended Motions , I can not yet speak , as they must be regulated by the neceſsity there may be , of my attending Parliament . If , I am able to arrange my matters according to my Wish , I shall not be desirous of quitting my own fireside , till the end of February next . I hate travelling in the dark , which I must do , if I go to the Meeting of the House in January . I anticipate much Debating there . The defeat of Castanos , and the consequent alterations which must take place in the Operations of our Forces in Spain , are much to be lamented . On the Cintra Convention , I can only say , that if Sir Hew is to blame , so is Sir Arthur , for he appears to have been as desirous of allowing Juniot to retire with the French Troops , as Sir Hew was . Why , the Succeſs at Vimeira was not followed up , on the Evening of the day the Action was fought , Sir Harry Burrard must explain . I do not pretend to say , what might have been the consequence of doing so ; but , as an old Soldier , I am quite convinced that our Troops ought to have advanced on the Enemy , while the effect of the threshing they ha ve got , was fresh in their Memory . A Convention might , perhaps , even then have been neceſsary ; but , I feel , that the Terms of it , might have been different . I know nothing of Mrs- Grant , or her Letters form the Mountains . Pray , dont suppose , that the smallest particle of Indigo pollutes our little domestick Circle . Lady Ramsay 's Letter was sent to her . She too , is unknown to Us . We have all read Faber . Much have I yawned , much have I slept over his Book , where I found it too deep for me to follow him ; but , much have I admired in it . Being a firm Believer in the fulfilment of Prophecy , I have for many Years conceived that the very extraordinary Succeſs of the infamous Buonaparte , and the very astonishing Events which we have all witneſsed , could not be accounted for , on any other Ground , than the literal accomplishment of those predictions , which are to be found in Daniel , the Apocalypse & c. This , does not make me superstitious . It is the duty of Man to act according to the soundest dictates of human Wisdom , and having done so , to leave the Iſsue to the Governor of the Universe . The Inventor of the Logarithms , published a Treatise on the Revelation of S t . John , Anno 1593 . He conceived , that the World would not last longer than to the Year 1786 -- All here join me in Love & best Wishes to you , & yours . Ever My Dear Sister , Your Affecte- Brother & faithful Friend Napier Best wishes to my Countrywoman Edinburgh , Twelfth December 1808 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
