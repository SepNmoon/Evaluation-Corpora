Yours of Friday , my dearest , reached me this morning . The kind warmth of the invitation contained in it , is too gratifying to be resisted . I have busineſs that will prevent my leaving town , for at least a fortnight : among the rest , the search for a Maid . I could not suit myself at all , in Herefordshire ; but , during my visit here , there was no distreſs , as my dear Mrs : Mann would not let me want any comfort . I have , however , been looking out , of late ; but as yet , without succeſs . I expect yet still another letter from B . ; but do not apprehend it will contain any thing to change the face of affairs . -- Should nothing very unforeseen , occur , I propose availing myself of your and Mr : D . 's kindneſs , in about the time I have mentioned . I am extremely obliged to you for pointing out the mode of conveyance , which I shall adopt . Mrs : Mann would have much pleasure in accompanying me , and paying her respects to you ; but her domestic busineſs will not permit her . I am much satisfied at having your joint approbation of my conduct in not insisting upon visiting at B . -- I was pretty sure you would be of my mind , when made acquainted with the difficulty of my situation . It is one for which I know you must have a fellow-feeling . With kindest love to Mr : D . and L . , I remain most truly your obliged and affectionate . 35 Aldgate High St : London Jan : 31 st : 1807 . P.S . I shall write to specify the precise time of my having the pleasure of waiting on you . Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire
