I thank you very much , my dear Cousin , for your kind letter ; which I lose no time in acknowledging . If you knew the perplexity of my mind about my future destination , you would , I am sure , forgive my not having written again from Bath . Besides , I was a good deal taken up , during a part of my stay , by Robert 's making a visit there : I was obliged to relieve my poor Father , as much as poſsible , from playing company ; to which he really was not equal . Till the question in your last , it escaped me that I had not mentioned this to you . You and my good friend , Mr : J : Dickenson , are extremely kind in thinking so much of my affairs . I am still in all the torment of suspense ; for Mr : H . tells me that there are points to be adjusted , before he will reengage , which can only be done by a personal conversation with Mr : Jones , the Proprietor , who has not yet left London . I have seen Mr : Jones , who answered my question in a very frank and handsome manner ; saying , that if Mr : H . was satisfied , he was , and desired nothing better than to go on . What these points are , that Mr : H . alludes to , neither Mr : Jones nor I , can tell ; as he has not written to him , and his letters to me , are written scribbled in such a hurry of busineſs , that they are any thing but explanatory . I sincerely wish your ideas and Mr : D . 's , of my affairs being “ in a good train , ” may be verified : of your kind anxiety about them , I am very sensible . -- It is with real affliction that I hear of the melancholy state of the excellent and accomplished Lady Herries . God grant that she may be able to derive experience comfort from the offices of friendship she will receive from you . At all events , you will derive satisfaction from bestowing them ; and I hope Cheltenham ( which agreed so well with you , before ) will counteract the ill effects I should otherwise apprehend from so trying a scene . If you find Lady Herries able to recollect former transient acquaintance , aſsure her of my sincere wishes for her recovery . Have the goodneſs to present my Compliments to Sir Robert . -- There is no chance , my dear Cousin , of persuading my Father to an excursion to Cheltenham : he does not like the place ; at best ; and his having resided in it with my poor Mother , would be an insuperable bar , even if he had a preference for it . -- My Sister goes to Ireland in July : should things turn out as I would have them , it will be a delightful opportunity for me to go over . She is , to do her justice , kindly anxious upon the subject . She is much to be pitied on the score of her own family ; for Captain Halliday 's affairs , owing to the state of West-India property , are likewise deranged : however , he has got a ship , and is gone out ; but his amiable wife is left at home , with six children , and a seventh approaching . For Captain Rodney , ( Lady Louisa 's husband ) my Sister has succeeded in getting an appointment in Ceylon , so much better than his former one , as to add 1200£ per annum to his income . With all her gaieties , she has ever been a n kind excellent Mother . -- Pray give my kind love to Mr : J : D : , and my Cousin , Louisa ; and accept , once more , my best thanks for all your affectionate interest . As my movements are very uncertain , you had best continue to direct here : your letters will be immediately forwarded , should I be absent . Hoping for a better account of Lady Herries , I remain , my dear Cousin , your sincerely obliged and affectionate J : Holman . N o : 35 Aldgate High St : London May 19 th : 1807 . How is Mr : D. senr : ? P.S . This is such an interlined scrawl , that I am half ashamed to send it : it is from haste , that I might not lose the Post .
