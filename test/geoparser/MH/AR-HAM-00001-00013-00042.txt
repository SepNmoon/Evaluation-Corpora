Sunning Hill Novr : 28 th : 1786 What my dear is the reason my dear Brother of your very long silence , do you think we are not interested in the Welfare of yr better half , more particularly in her present situation , I can aſsure you that my mother & myself accuse you of neglect , not yr wife because I am sure she is pretty well engaged , write soon & let us know how she does , you forget the distance we are at & the love we bear to the person in question . I had a letter the other day from our Dear Anna Maria , she is pretty well , but much engaged in settling her accounts with Mr. Jackson , I hope before we go to Town they will be finally adjusted it will be a heavy load taken f r om her , The little Henry ( Mrs Jackson youngest child ) is just recover 'd from the small pox . Our neighborhood is rather dull at present , all the Lodger 's being gone , they being most agreeable people we miſs them very much , the Cole 's particularly , Mrs. John Egerton & the Coln . have taken a house here , but she is so fine a Lady & we visit at so great a distance that I can hardly prevail on myself to call her a neighbour , We have one family who are most ami a ble people , I have quite an affection for them , we see each other continually , which makes the country pleasant this very unpleasant month . The Athenaid an Epic Poem left in Man . by Mr. Glover I have not begun publishing yet , as my friends are rather dilatary , it is unpleasant but you know one must submit where one can not help one 's self , the work was to have been set about the beginning of this month , to have made its appearance in the world next Febry- I shall be in great luck if it is set about before Christmas , I could not myself promise a thing without performing it , but it is the fashion of the present times , Mr Collier 's fault is unsteadineſs , an unpleasant one for me . , t T he expence of publishing is enormous , I hope I shall have succeſs , I print a thousand Copies , the expence is £250 if they are all sold I gain £250 & so on in proportion , the size is the same as the Leonidas as Mr- Cadell thought that would make it more Saleable , 4 volumes at fourteen Shillings . -- Tell Mrs. D : I have sent this account as I imagine it gives her pleasure to know what I am about . Excuse this sad scrawl , which I should not have sent had I been in Spirits to have written it over again , but this days post brought us a most melancholy account of a young Lady a school Fellow & an intimate acquaintance of mine having been thwarted in a love affair , having thrown herself out of a two pr . of Stairs window . her Father is a merchant a most amiable man , she had form 'd a connexion with a merchants Clerk in the neighbourhood , her father expostulated with her on the impropriety of such a connexion , last Friday she came down to breakfast but would eat nothing , the same at dinner her Father spoke to her & beg 'd her to tell him what ail 'd , her answer was “ she would rather die ” he left his house to go as usual being post night to the counting house , was sent for home & found his only daughter senseleſs & motionleſs , her arm much shatter 'd & otherwise greatly bruised , having as before related throw n herself out of a two pr . of stairs window , his agonies at the dreadful spectacle is a re not to be described , she is not thought in danger , hapleſs miserable girl not to be able to rein in her paſsions . Mr Bourdieu has finally adjusted his Family affairs , I hope to be happy , Nancy is still with us & is to remain till we go . My Mother is well & desires her best love to you & our dear Miranda mine to her , & pray present our united compts . to yr . Father & sisters whom we hope continue well . Adieu Dr . Mr. Dickenson believe me yr . Sincere friend & humble Servant Mary Glover PS whenever John Dickenson Junr- Esqr Windsor near Taxal Chapel le Frith single Sheet Miſs Glover Novm . 1786
