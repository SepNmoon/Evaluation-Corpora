My Dear Miſs Hamilton I am much obliged to you for taking the opportunity of a Meſsenger from Bullstrode to give me the pleasure of hearing from you & also for the kind interest you take in what concerns me so nearly , as the health of my dear little Grand daughter . I thank God I have reason to hope she may get rid of her troublesome Complaints , & Mrs Delany was so good herself as to give me Comfort about it by instancing an almost similar Complaint that had been outgrown . Mrs Feilding is not here but Harriet desires her Compliments to wch . I will only add that I remain ever most faithfully & Sincerely Yrs . CFinch Pray remember me to Mrs Delany Windsor Sunday Morng . 23 d . Novbr . 1783
