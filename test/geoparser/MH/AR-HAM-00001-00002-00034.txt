My Dearest Love -- I must keep my promise & write to day tho it has cost me some ounces -- as it is very warm -- you know what London is & how difficult it is to command time -- Monday -- I had just filled my scanty paper when we were called down to dinner -- I wished the dinner & paper both at the devil as I was in the humour to write & sometimes If I dont write at the moment I think of things they escape my memory -- After dinner at 6 Eliz . & I walked out AMaria left us in Oxford S t . & returned home -- we went down to the palace thrō the Courts & up the park to the Queens house then thrō the Horse Gards into Whitehal we called & drank Tea with Mr. Thompson who walked with us to the palace -- when we came home the Cr . was sleepy & went immediately to bed -- I went to Emma & staid an hour with her & her Mother -- she told me “ that she had laid down such a plan for her conduct on her return to Naples as She was was satisfied wd . ensure to her universal respect & the approbation of Sr. Wm -- She knows that it would be in her power to make him happy -- that gratitude , duty , inclination & every consideration would compel her to do every thing in her power to please him , and she was certain she shd . do it -- ” I told her that Eyes of many people were upon her , that I rejoiced to hear of their determination as I ardently wished that she & Sir Wm . might be perfectly happy -- that I cd . see it would be very easy for her to keep up in him that warmth of attachment which he entertained for her & that I hoped he would always find Emma & Lady H . the same -- & c & c & c -- She enquired how we had gone on about the ECr.- Settlemt . & c -- I told her every thing -- She ( & every body ) expreſs the greatest astonishment at Eliz . conduct in choosing ye- Cr . Emma 's Mother ( who seems a shrewd sensible woman ) said “ Lord Sir -- yesterday I thought she looked at him as if she could have devoured him -- she surely doats upon him ” -- Eliz : is thought by most people to be very pretty -- I was speakg of Sir Wm . to Emma & said how much I admired him & added that I loved him -- She aſsured me there was no Love lost -- for that He liked me as well -- she read to me a very afft : Letter of his to her from Windsor -- the King joked him about Em .. at a distance & gave a hint that he thought he was not quite so religious as when he married the late Ly H—— He has got leave to wear the Windsor Uniform the K . said Nobody had so good a right to ask for it -- ( I shd . have thought he shd . have given him another Uniform ) -- when I came home I found La Signora had followed her husband & left me a few oysters which I eat & then would have written a long letter to my Love , but all the Doors were locked -- so I went up stairs & when I was half undreſsed I heard Sr. R. Herries say what is he gone to bed so soon -- I threw on my Clothes in a moment & went down to him -- we had a good laugh at the Dear Creature 's expence -- Sir Rt . was so kind to call on me ( as he knew I shd . be at his house this morng ) to inform me when he shd be home as he had several engagements -- he staid half an hour & then I went to bed -- because I had no thing better to do -- I called upon Mr. Hamilton in the course of the day to get a Dft . on Hammersley for the 1000 £ as Sr. R . made a demur about the Bond but he was not at home -- Tuesday 30 th -- at 9 I went to Mr. Hamilton -- staid there half an hour -- read to them a part of yr- L . relating to Robt . told his M . how much he loved her & c & said a great deal in his favor -- fixed wh- Mrs. H . to call on her at 12 & went away -- I forgot to tell you that my reason for going to Emma last night was to desire that I might introduce AMaria to her that she might hear her sing -- I told her that I had appointed AM . to come at 10 -- the hour Emma had fixed for her Masters to attend -- at my return I found AM -- we with Mrs. P . went directly to Emma who recd . AM . very kindly -- who could not contain her astonishment at the simplicity of Em . dreſs -- Emma sang enchantingly -- and Nanny was quite overcome & diſsolved in tears at the duet of Nina , I was affected too -- Emma thanked her for the compts . that was paid her -- then she sang some lively ones in a masterly stile -- her Master has not a good voice -- but great taste indeed -- at 12 I was obliged to go for the Dft . Emma told Nanny that one day this week she was to sing a great deal & shew the Attitudes & desired her company -- we are all to dine there at 3 -- & then we attend her to Romney s -- I went to Mr. H 's & got the Dft . -- he began a conversation about R—— his aversion to him is founded principally on R . 's want of Veracity -- I made a motion to go , but he preſsed me to stay , & I saw he wanted to say sometg to me -- I desired him to let R . stay a little longer wch . obliged him very much -- he said Mr. Daniel had written to desire that R . might go to Litchfield Races but that he thought very improper & as I wished him to stay a little at Taxal he desired R . would write to his Uncle to put of his Visit till after the Races -- he talked of your attachment to R . & after a good deal of hammering he made a faint proposal , expressing a wish that we would take him till he comes of Age & that we shd . be liberally rewarded , I made no ansr- & he said he wished to have some Conversation with me before I left town -- I shd . be glad to oblige him & the young Man but will not lead you into any Scrape for any Consideration whatever -- I had a general invitation to Dinner at 4 OClock & fm . Sr. Rt . Herries at 5 -- Give my best Love to Ly Herries & tell her how sorry I am that she means to stay at Taxal only a few days -- God bleſs You my dear dear Wife In great haste -- but ever tenderly & Affy .
