Wolverton January 3 1809 My Dear Cousin I am very much obliged to you for your most kind & accommodating letter , but for Thursday I have secured myself a bed at a Certain Magpie Inn Woburn which is a very snug little place & I shall dine & dreſs there & get some of my Friends from the Newport side to pick me up & drop me enpaſsant , but I am equally obliged to you for your kind offer . I had indeed fully promised myself the pleasure of a day or two at Leighton House at this time but I am cruelly deranged by being drawn such a way from home & however gratified by doing what is required of me yet it is with sad reluctance I quit this house on monday next . I am happy to say Mrs C & the Child are both as well as poſsible . Except most heartily wishing you Mr & Miſs Dickenson many happy new years no more till we meet but Ever your most Affect Cousin AH Cathcart In truth this was written last night late , the appearance of the day makes me fear Thursday will fall short . Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzard
