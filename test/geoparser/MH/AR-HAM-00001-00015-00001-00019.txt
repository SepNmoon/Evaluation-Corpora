St James 's Saturday 10 th Feb -- My dear Friend ! Bell who arrived last night from Bath made me nicely & sincerely happy by giving me the most comfortable account poſsible of your situati on health and spirits -- I wanted this I aſsure you , & the aſsurance of her having seen you three times since you lay in , for as I had heard of it only by chance , from Ly Stormont whom I accidentally met , I was very uneasy about you -- My Father had forgot to mention it , & when he did , it was without any circumstances or particulars , to make me feel comfortable . Mr Dickn was I conclude too much engaged in communicati n g the information to all your Friends , I had I own , hoped that he would have given me one line -- & now my dear Friend , let me tell you , how I rejoice with you & Mr Dickenson in this event , so happily got over , & in your happineſs which I suppose is not to be expreſsed in having a dear little child to love and to cherish & educate , what a delightful task ! what a continual source of happineſs ! an object of love & anxiety & attentio n & a continued return of all the sentiments it inspires you with -- I need not ask whether you nurse it yoursel f I think I know your sentiments upon that subject -- well you are at this minute by far the happiest being I am acquainted with , & it does me good to think of you God bleſs you ! I thank you my dear for your letter , which I ought to have answerd ere now -- I answered & thanked you for it mentally , & in my heart -- did you feel that ? I continue very well thank God , & am in good spirits for I am occupied constantly -- I am deeply engaged in Euclid at present , & have been induced to take up this long neglected study by a present that Sir G. Elliott has made me of a new edition of that Book , & by his coming to read it with me -- he once accidentally discovered ( in an aſsembly ) that I understood somethi n g of it , & that one word which betrayed me to him & to him alone , interested him about me , & made him desirin g of my acquaintance -- I cultivated it a little last summer , & he is just come to Town for the meeti n g of P . I have seen him twice here , & we have read of that & other things a great deal , & certainly with mor e pleasure to me , & advantage too , than I should alone . I do not know whether you are acquainted with him my dear , but he is a most sensible well informed good man , with a gentleneſs & elegance of manners that particularly please me -- I am reading too by way of recreation , thro ' the set of french Memoirs , now publishing , from the 13 th century to this day , I find the stile , language & manners of that early age extremely pleasing from their great simplicity , and I am more interested in this lecture than I could have expected -- I am just now attending Mr Walker 's lectures , my view was merely that of accompanyi n g Ly Carlisle 's Daughter who goes for the first time , but I find great pleasure in recollect in g what I formerly new , & fixi n g that knowledge in my mind by fresh experiments -- if you ask how a fine London Lady finds time for all this ( besides musick masters 4 times per week ) I will tell you my dear th at I am not a fine Lady , & that I get up before 8 in the mor n i n g , that is the secret -- my Evenings it is true are all engaged , but very little in the world -- the Queen twice a week & the others sitti n g with my Friend 's , oftenest with Ly Carlisle , sometimes the opera -- that is my life -- I thank you my dear Friend for all your infor mation about my Sister -- Nothing can be more than your inquiries & observations -- when has been some time in Town I shall write you word what I think of her -- adieu my dear Friend -- God in heaven bleſs you -- I am interrupt ed & stopped , so I must leave you -- adieu -- adieu !
