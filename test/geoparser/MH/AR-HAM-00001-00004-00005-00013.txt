There is a Spirit of curiosity My Dear Miſs Hamilton in regard to the contents of Letters going from hence which prevents my writing to you as often as I should otherwise do , for I feel myself constrain 'd unleſs I have an oppertunity ( as I at present have ) of sending my letter to the Roman Post , where it is past inquiry , your last of ye 27 th . of March gave me true pleasure , as almost every line is a fresh proof to me of the goodneſs & Sensibility of your heart , in some situations I should wish you ( for your own quiet ) a leſs share of the latter , but in Yours there is so large a claim upon you for gratitude , that you would be unworthy of the bleſsings you enjoy if you felt them leſs Sensibly , & the fruits of that Sensibility will I am sure will be a redoubled ardour in fulfilling those dutys which I know you have so much at Heart -- I rejoice with you upon Her Majesty s recovery & shall be much obliged to you ( if you have a proper oppertunity ) if you will say every thing that is most respectful & Dutifull for me . My last was dated ( I think ) ye 28 th . or 30 th . of Janry from Caserta where we remain 'd ( except ten days of the Carnival ) till the beginning of April , & I own I was sorry to quit the Calm of Caserta for the hurry of Naples , however my pennance has not been very long for we have been this fortnight at our Villa near Portici where the Court is at present -- it is a lovely situation ( tho ' upon the side of a Volcano which is at this minute throwing up liquid fire ) & the only objection I have to it is , that there are other circumstances which interrupt my quiet more than our neighbour Vesuvius , for example , to morrow is the Empreſs Queen s day & the Grand Maitreſse has just sent me word that there is a ball at Court , to which Alas ! I must go to carry three English Ladies , you may imagine Ly Maynard is not of the number , tho ' James 's powder has been almost as great a Specifick in regard to her , as for fevers ; you know I refused ( as I thought it my Duty not ) to present her , & I had a great deal of vexation upon that account ; tho ' . the Queen of Naples has always , & still does say that I have done right , & that Her Majty . thinks herself obliged to me for the part I acted -- & after all this you will be surprised to hear that the Queen has seen her ; but not to keep you in suspence -- when we we were at Caserta the Prince Marsico , one of the King s favourite Lords of the Bedchamber was given over with a fever , Ld Maynard hearing of it went to his house & tho ' refused admittance many times , forced his way into his apartment where he found him surrounded by Physicians who all declared he had only four hours to live , Ld M—— then insisted upon administring the powders which he did with succeſs -- & the Patient was soon out of danger , Ly M . then appear 'd in the nursing character offerd to make the Prince s broths & c. & shew 'd him so much attention that when he was recover 'd the y family tried to find out what way they could best expreſs their gratitude to the Maynards , who let them know what they most desired was a presentation to the Queen of Naples -- this was a difficult matter , but the Prince s Sister ( a Lady of the bedchamber ) undertook it , she went first to the Grand maitreſse who positively refused to undertake it unleſs I desired it , She then went to the Queen threw herself at her feet in tears , & told her Majty . it was the greatest service she could do her family to permit her to present Ly M . after two hours begging & praying the Queen consented upon condition it was not disagreable to Sr Wm . who was sounded , & finding it was perfectly indifferent to him provided we were not the channel of her presentation -- Ly M . was carried in private by Pce . Marsico 's Sister but without the Grand maitreſse I am told The Queen said to her that she was glad her humanity to one of her subjects had given her an oppertunity of seeing her , & that she wish 'd her well -- this satisfied Ld & Ly M . for the time but since that The Queen gave so open a mortification to Ly M . that shew 'd what she had done had been purely to comply with intreaties she could not resist -- You know the Q——n s character & I leave you to make your reflexions upon the whole proceeding , I must only add the Speech of a Frenchman of fashion to some Neapolitans upon the occasion -- “ en verité Meſsieurs vous êtes bien heureux d'avoir des Souverains qui veut bien se charger de la recconoiſsance de leurs sujets . ” -- I have lately been reading Monsr . de Luc 's Letters to the Queen , there are parts of them which entertain 'd me much particularly his account of the simplicity & goodneſs of the inhabitants near the Glaciere de Buet -- I k h ave had some acquaintance with the Peasants of the Valley of Chamouni who are quite in the stile of those he mentions & I have seen traits of their Character which I shall honor & love as long as I live -- I think I never saw so unspoil 'd a race , but Monsr . de Luc has not mention 'd a part of Switzerland very worthy his notice , I therefore imagine he has not been in that part , -- it is the Bailliage of Frutingen twelve leagues from the City of Berne -- the extent of the Bailliage is very considerable & the country exceſsively rich & fertile & the union of the inhabitants as great as their Simplicity ( & to tell you the truth I am tempted to think the former the consequence of the latter ) one of their customs is ( I believe ) quite peculiar to themselves , when any one of them declares his intention of building a house , & the day on which he proposes beginning the work , the report goes thro ' the Country , & the morning he setts to work , instead of two or three workmen whom he has engaged , he has sometimes twenty , thirty or more , & none come empty handed they have all little wooden pails , in which one brings a Cheese , another a ham , another a cake , & c & c. which they consign to the Mistreſs of the house who after having wash 'd their pails while they work makes baignés ( a kind of cake they are fond of ) & puts a portion of them in each pail -- the next day other workmen come in the same manner & so on every day till they have finish 'd building the house -- I must now tell you that these workmen are the Farmers & their Servants of the same Bailliage who according to the time they can spare give one , two , three , or more days labour to aſsist their Brother of the same Bailliage ; when the house is finish 'd , the particular friends bring the Windows , sometimes a window is the present of one friend , sometimes two club to make it , but the Arms of the presenter ( for they all pretend to Arms ) is work 'd in coulour 'd Glaſs at the top of the Window -- when all this is finish 'd , the farmer & his Wife send an invitation to all those who have aſsisted in building the house , & give them a feast , where nothing is spared , ( among the rest I must mention one thing that is never forgot -- viz -- the bottoms of sugar loaves hollow 'd out into cups fill 'd with thick cream which Frutigen is famous for , ) all this I had from an inhabitant & native of the place whose truth I can depend upon . -- all this bonhomie & friendlineſs of heart ( when I reflect upon it , ) often makes mine ache when I see the difference of manners & sentiments of those I am at present obliged to live among -- if I was to live here a hundred Years I think I should never be broke into the ways of this Italian World -- but thank God both Sr Wm . & I have resources in our own house which makes our comfort independent of them & we have a small society that we should be glad of i t n any country -- this is happy for at the rate people now go on in England ( wth . our Small fortune ) we dare not look homewards , unleſs it was The King s pleasure to command Sr Wm . s Services elsewhere , which I do n't think probable . -- as the case is , My Dr Miſs Hamilton & that it is unlikely I should have the comfort of seeing you a great while , I hope you will let me have that of hearing from you more frequently . -- if you have a wish to See Sr Wm . & me at Naples & will give yourself the trouble to call at a Painters of the name of Allen ( an honest simple little Soul worthy of being an inhabitant of Buet ) you will find us upon canvas , his manner of painting is the same of Zoffani s , & he succeeds admirably , I will add his direction afterwards for I must ask it of Sr Wm . who joins with me in every thing that is kind -- when you see Ly Dartrey pray make my best Compliments to her , I can not tell you how much I esteem her -- I am My Dear Miſs Hamilton Yr Sincerely Affectionate Aunt C Hamilton Wednesday May ye 12 th -- Allen s direction is at Mr Taſsy s somewhere in Leicester Fields -- Taſsy makes Seals & pastes -- Ly Moston knows where Allen lives I have not time to read over my letter I wish it may be legible --
