Wherwell -- Friday -- 4 th . Septr 1789 Dear Mrs- Dickinson , I hope You recieved a very long Letter which I took the liberty of writing You from Bristol-Wells , in compliance with your request , at the same time that I returned several Packets of the Manuscripts which You was so obliging to send me . And since my return home , I believe about Two months ago , I divided a Copy of the Rev : Mr- Collier 's Sonnets in Two Franks , & enclosed them also to You , but I am quite at a loſs to know whether any of them arrived safely . -- I am sure I shall interest your Concern by telling You that my excellent Father , whom You & Mr- Dickenson so much admired , has had a most shocking fall from his Horse which has confined him now near Six Weeks . He fell with all his weight on his Hip & Thigh , did not break or dislocate any bone , but all the Muscles recieved such a violent bruise & general Shock , that He has not yet any use of the Leg . He kept his Bed for three Weeks , & the Rhumatism falling into the part affected , added very considerably to his Sufferings . He has come down-stairs only within these few days , & moves about the House with the aſsistance of two Men-Servants & his Crutches . A Surgeon from Andover , & another of great repute , from Winchester , attend him ; They do not seem to think it by any means irrecoverable , tho ' they hold out to us , that it must yet be tedious ; but my Father 's Spirits are extremely dejected from the total alteration in his way of life , which You know was so very active before , & from his own perswasion that He never shall have the use of his leg again . And He has returns frequently of violent fits of Pain . You will sympathise with us all I really believe & particularly with dear Mrs- Iremonger 's tender feelings on this occasion , tho ' She exerts herself wonderfully & her tranquil mind is a great Support , together with her charming & just way of thinking with regard to all the trying Events of Life . -- I return You the Riddles , the Quipos , & Mr- Dickinson 's french Songs ; Over the aria d'anfoſsi , such a misfortune with my Ink has befallen me , that I scarcely dare venture to excuse myself ; I can only rely on the Generosity of Mr- Dickinson 's Mind , which I am sure knows how to forgive ; & that He will accept of my best Thanks for his putting it into my power to do him so much Mischief . -- I presume You have the happineſs of being acquainted with your elegant Poet & Philosopher of Derby , Dr- Darwin , who has so highly charmed us with his “ Botanical Garden or the Loves of the Plants ” . Surely we have not had to boast of such an ingenious Production for many long Years ! so novel in it 's Imagination , & such beautiful Lines ! How charmingly too has He introduced your Friend Mrs- Delaney ! my Father & Mrs- Iremonger join with me in Compliments & good wishes , with those of my Brother , to You & Mr- Dickinson . -- Little Catherine is quite well , & sends Love to her lively friend your Darling Louisa . You will naturally allow of my concluding Abruptly in this time of Trouble at our House , when I am frequently called off , & therefore must now subscribe myself Your Obliged Humble Servant E—— Iremonger To Mrs- Dickinson Taxal & gt ; Chester Chapel le Frith
