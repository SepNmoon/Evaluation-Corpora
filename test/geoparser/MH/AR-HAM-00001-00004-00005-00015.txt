Caserta Decr 9 th - 1780 I have fretted at my own Silence My Dear Miſs Hamilton , but the difficulty I have been under to answer the important question in your last has been the principal cause of it , I really have taken up my pen seven or eight times , & laid it down as many , & perhaps might do the same again did I not flatter myself that Your own good Sense will by this time have directed you much better than any advice Sr Wm . or I could at this distance give you -- We know your heart & are both of us sure that gratefull Monitor will never suffer you to do any thing which can be displeasing to The Queen to whom you owe ( not only ) so much Duty ( but ) love & Affection for Her great goodneſs to you . do not think however that I have been satisfied without hearing of you ; you are too near my heart for me willingly to remain in ignorance of what concerns you , & at my request some of my friends have given me constant accounts of you & very satisfactory ones except in relation to the anxiety you have experienced which I am happy to think is now well over . -- We have spent the last two months at this place the Court being here for the sake of Shooting & we are likely to remain here the greater part of the Winter . The King & Queen for want of a diversion are practising with great aſsiduity a Pantomime Ballet in which there is to be singing . The Subject is the Judgement of Paris , His Majesty is to represent Paris , & The Queen Venus , The French Ambaſsador is to be Apollo , ( but Alas ! it will be a setting Sun for I think he can not be leſs than Sixty Years old ) , The Ruſsian Minister is Mercury , & the rest of the characters are to be filld by the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber & Cameristes , the Vienna Minister & Sr Wm . did not think themselves of an age to commence Commedians , & therefore are not of the ballet , the magnificence I hear is to be very great ; when I have seen it I will give you a further account of it . -- We have just lost the Company of Sr Wm . s cousin Beckford who is sett out for Venice , he has been with us in the house some weeks & I can not tell you how sorry we are to part with him , his very superior parts & talents , his extensive knowledge at so early an age , & his perpetual Wit & good humour has been a continual amusement to us , & given both Sr Wm . & me a great Affection for him , pray tell this to Ly Ephingham whose nephew he is it is but doing him justice , & the doing so gives me a double pleasure , as I am sure it will give Ly Ephingham ( who you know I love ) so much . -- We have this minute had a flying report that D'Estaing s Fleet was dispersed & destroy 'd by a Storm , I wish it may prove true ( God forgive me ) & that we may have a glorious Peace , for I am so true a Briton that I hope & trust we never shall have any other ; -- when that happens Sr Wm . must beg the Kings leave to come home for a few months to Settle our private Affairs in Wales wch . I fear are going very ill , our Agent being dead , & several farms fallen in , & encroachments made , by which we lose considerably , & while we have ( as we have at present ) a debt of Six thousand Pds . for which we are paying five per cent these neglects make us live under great anxiety -- if my health is able to support the Climate I shall be happy to revisit Dear England , but I own I dread it , upon the remembrance of what I suffer 'd the last time -- however my desire is so great to see my friends that it will give me courage to go thro ' a great deal . -- I am interrupted at this instant with an account of the Death of the Empreſs Queen the Queen is in hystericks , & all the Palace in confusion -- her Death was occasion 'd by a violent cold upon her breast which they hoped was already much better , I am not surpris 'd for when I knew her she seem 'd to have so much difficulty of breathing from her enormous fat ( & beside had immense swelld legs ) that I did not then think she would have lasted so long as she has done -- I am sorry to finish My letter with so melancholy a Subject but I am obliged to seal my letter it but I can not without begging you when you have a proper oppertunity to Offer both Sr Wm . s and My Duty to Her Majesty in the most respectfull manner -- Adieu My Dear Miſs Hamilton I am ever with great truth Yr Most Affectionate Aunt C Hamilton Sr Wm . desires his kind love to you
