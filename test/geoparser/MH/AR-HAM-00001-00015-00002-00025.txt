Horton 3 d June 1783 Tuesday Eveg 9 o'Clock Here I am comfortably enjoying the Society of Your Father , Brother , & Sister , whilst You are dreading the fatigue of tomorrow , I have ask 'd for a Folio sheet , wch . I intend , if I have any influence , to have fill 'd for Your amusement -- how it will answer that intention I know not -- yet we have been ( Notwithstanding the Rain ) wonderfully bright this Afternoon -- particularly Sr. Robert -- Miſs Hamilton has been tiring herself to Death here -- In the first Place when she came in , she found no Fire and thought herself quite lost in the three comfortleſs Rooms especially as the Weather towards 3 o'clock changed very much for the worse . During Dinner she was so perished with the Cold that she could not eat a morcel , & tho ' we at last prevailed to have a Fire in the eating-Room yet she was so ill used by Sr Robt who through a very usual Absence of Mind called her Miſs Flora , that I was quite ashamed at the reception our Guest met with -- It then began to rain violently , and when a little after 8 it ceased , by way of shewing Miſs Hamilton the Stables & c she was dragged up to her ancles in the Wet . We are now going to Supper and sitting very comfortably by the Fire-side -- -- only think of that -- ( I thought of you last Night that is by the by ) -- . Miſs H.—— thinks the Suite of Rooms horrible , old fashioned & a hundred horrible & ceteras . I deny every thing that has been said , upon the foregoing subject ; Miſs H—— has spent a delightfull day -- she had a very pleasant drive from C—— Hall -- is quite enchanted with this place -- thinks it , by far the most beautifull spot in this Country -- the house magnificent , commodious , & surtout comfortable , & is particularly charmed , with the numbers of dear little round tables -- I need not tell you that our conversation has been lively , & brilliant . Miſs Hamilton has been wonderfully entertained by my st d rumming upon the harpsichord -- by our continual eloges of Flora -- & by Papa s wit -- in short she it will quite break her heart , to tear herself from our delightfull society , & will only live by the hopes of soon returning to it . Bell s wit -- [ Is how much in Town ? I will trouble you to let me know -- How snug we are -- My Compts : to the little Worthies -- Have you been lately in the Hotel de Ponthomme or conveyed any where in the Pink What Nonsense I have been writing -- My -- only think of that -- ] we underwritten beg of you to present our congratulations to Sir Harry Bridgeman tomorrow -- their Majesties G.

I have spent a very agreeable day and that my reception has been too pleasant not to make me resolve to ac̄ept the friendly invitation of spending some time here after my Return from Derbyshire . I hope then to enjoy the happineſs of paſsing some happy hours with You 11 o'Clock I am now my dear in the Yellow Bed Chamber , which is to be call 'd my Room . Your Sister has made me feel quite at home , she has provided me with a little table -- pen & Ink & c -- how I wish You were with me at this moment . I saw B.G—— yesterday he gave me a very good account of You , but he desired I would advise You by all means to have the tooth that pains You drawn out , for he said it was not proper for you to use laudanum & that if You lost rest by suffering pain it might bring on Your old complaints -- think of this & be advised .
