recd- Tuesday Morng . 10 o'Clock 14 th Decbr . 1779 Be not astonished my dear Miranda , at my silence for ye 3 or 4 last days attribute it not to indifference for I aſsure you yt . nothing Can be further from my mind than yt . I am sorry my Miranda to tell you my friend yt . you must not expect to hear from me above once or at most twice in ye . same Week of & yt . I am afraid in a very short Notes , however be sure yt . whatever opportunities I can seize I will . This moment I am writing is taken out of my time for rest it is very late & am afraid of being interrupted every moment by ye . arrival of Lt—— C—— H however I will scrawl , all & as long as I can . Know then my Friend , yt . I am more than ever in love , & yt . ye dear object of my paſsion , corresponds with my flame , & yt . our love is mutual , she was attacked ye . other in ye . house for addreſsing ever tender speech she ought to have addreſsed to Prince Florisel to me , you may see of what texture they are by reading ym- in Shakespeare . I also have had intelligence from a Gentleman who was at ye . Play at C——t G——n T——e when we were there last Week & who is acquainted with Sr .. John Lade , by whom he sat at ye Th——e who has had an intimate connection avec mon aimable & chère séductrice yt . y h e remarked to this person how tired I appeared of ye . piece with an arch remark yt . I shd .. not have been so tired had I been at D——y L——e T——e & then said I have heard a great deal of ye . P—— attachment for My .. R . & I can aſsure you yt . she is as much pleased with him as he can be with her , upon which this person yt . related this to me , said to Sr. J——n take Sr. J——n . yt . you are not undermined by this galant young Rival , upon wh . he answered with an Oath B——y G——d I shd . be very glad of it for both their sakes as they seem so mutually attached to each other . I shd .. not have troubled you with this conversation my Friend , had as I do not think entering particularly into such matters is a fit or proper topic for you , however I did it in order to fullfil my old promise & to demonstrate to you ye transports I feel at this relation , I am metamorphosed into ye . gay galant Lothario , into as happy a creature as I was almost desponding with Love , paſsion , & ye most ardent flame , boiling altogether in my bosom yesterday , so indeed they do now , but transports are of the happy instead of ye . unhappy kind . God bleſs you Adieu . I am Yr . ever affectionate Friend Palemon toujours de meme
