Sunning Hill Sept .. 19 1783 My Dear Miſs Hamilton I could not have expected your forgiveneſs , nor should I have deserved it , had I permitted my mother 's letter to have gone to the post with out writing a few lines to you myself . My father is out all day looks well eats , drinks , & walks well , & never enjoy 'd better health ; therefore I leave you to judge by your own feelings how happy we must all be . We have had a great deal of company in the house with us for these three weeks past , & next week we expect Mrs. Burges Mr .. & Mrs. Strothoff to stay with us for some days . I have read in the newspapers the accounts Sr. William Hamilton sent to the Royal Society , of the earthquakes in Meſsina , & the two Calabria 's , surely there never was known more distreſs nor any thing so dreadful ; how happy are we in not being subject to such misfortunes in this country , we have had some very bad storms of Thunder & lighting during this summer . I hope Sr .. William Wake is recover 'd & Lady Wake is better since your being with her , as no doubt she must be happy in having so amiable & so sincere a friend as yourself to help her nurse Sr .. William , Friendship in general is I fear too much as Goldsmith represents it in his Edwin & Angelina And what is friendship , but a name , A Charm that lulls to Sleep ; A shade that follows wealth & fame And leaves the wretch to weep . I hope ever to enjoy & to deserve your friendship which you have favor 'd me with , I may say from my infancy . I am so r ry to say my mother has been disappointed in a return of friendship from some which would surprize & perhaps hurt you was you to know who I hint at , but I 'll trust no more to pen & paper as that is sometimes faithleſs too . I drank tea with our dear & amiable friend Miss A. C . last night & flatter myself I improve by her conversation , during the seven weeks she was with us we read Mrs Chapone s letters they are very improving . I have read Goldsmith s Roman history & was very much entertaind with it . Our Neighbourhood is very agreeable the Card parties have began we have one this evening , Mr .. Henry & Mrs .. Grenville are gone went out for three weeks which time will be elaps 'd next Sunday , excuse the blunders that are in this letter & believe me to be with the sincerest regard yours . M G . I have sent inclosed a few lines I cut out of a news paper I can say them by heart so you need not return them I thought them very pretty . Mrs .. Lenton desires her compliments to you M Glover
