Wandsworth hill Sepr . 4 th I am sorry my dear Miſs Hamilton you should think me so negligent as to have omitted answ'ring your kind Letter ; I thought my last would have reached you before you left Windsor or would not have directed it there -- Lady Stormont & the Child continue perfectly well she wished very much to write to you but I thought it more prudent to check her in that & insisted upon being her Secretary -- she complains that I am very arbitrary and desires , as I wont let her speak for herself that I will tell you how happy she shall be to have the pleasure of your company at the little Boy 's Christening & that she hopes you will if poſsible contrive to come here , she thinks of having the ceremony performed on Sunday se'nnight but if Saturday should be more convenient & agreeable to you she will very willingly change the day -- she begs you will give her Compts . to Coll . Greville & desire he will keep himself unengaged for that occasion -- Lady Stormont 's Coq de perle necklace was delivered into Mr. Duval 's hands yesterday morning -- Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton I am interrupted and must therefore conclude believe me ever yr . very affecte- & c Elizath . M. Murray Papa desires his best Compts- & joins with me in hoping you will favor us with yr . Company
