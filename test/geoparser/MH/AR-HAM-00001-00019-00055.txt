Edinburgh Sepr , 15 th - 1773 I recieved My Dear Ward letter from Margate last post & am greatly obliged to her not only for writing it but also at the joy you expreſs at my recovery which thank God goes on as well as I could wish and barring not having come to my strength yet am far better than I have been these six years past & am in greater spirits than you ever ſaw me in ; but am kept in a regimen as to diet & am in bed every night before nine o'clock , not allowed to read or write but very little at a time , so you must be content wt short letters for ſome time . By this time I hope you have got home & Mrs Hamilton quite well believe me it gave both Lady Napier & I great concern to hear that she was not well but I hope home will do great things for her I know she dont like much being from home & when she gets out of the bustle of Margate her Headachs will leave her I hope -- you ſay nothing about yourself whither the bathing has removed your complaints or not but I hope it has as you dont complain . your House is most extravagant but at all publick pla ce s now they suck the blood from those that are oblig 'd to come especially in th is family way but its lucky peopl e are not in a neceſsity to stay above a few Weeks otherwise no fortune could support the expence of it -- I am extremely glad you have diverted yourself so well tho you know I do not approve of reading books of controverſy I think its a very bad study for any body but more especially for young Lady 's , if I ever read any I certainly would read Beattie on your recommendation but the Bible guides my faith entirely and I am reſolved to read nothing of that kind but itself as I am ſure there is more there then ever I shall be able to practise in my life & all kind of Controve rſy in my opinion tends to hurts minds especially young ones & tho Beattie may be on the right side yet if a more ſenſible Man happens to anſwer him , he may do much more harm than the other does good for which reaſon I am of opinion its best not to read those books at all -- So you think that you have a right to be ſaucy because you have taken it in to your very wise noddle that I brought my last illneſs on my self by flying from Margate , but for all your obstinacy know by these Preſents that I was ill before I left Buxton & that the Phiſicians says that it was the crisis of my Complaints for many years past and as I could not go to bed for the Asthmatic complaints it was just as good to go on , especially as I could sleep in the Chaise & that it was the only place I was easy in & had I stayed on ye road or taken more time I might have been & would certainly have been laid up in ſome place -- where advice would have been difficult to have been got & I not here to have told you now this history so upon the whole , I believe its just as well as it is , & I so far from repenting of it , I should do the ſame again was I in the same condition so pray Miſs no more Saucineſs on that account espicially as I make no doubt but you 'll find other opportunity 's of being so without giving yourself much trouble You are My dear Ward quite mistaken in supposing the young people dont remember you , the three eldest does extremely well often i nquires after you and now joins Lady Napier in best Compts- to you as I do to Mrs- Hamilton with them so pray write ſoon all abt yourselves and believe me My dearest Mary most Affctly Yours I should be happy to know the Wakes from your character of them Remember my respects to good Mrs Rogers who I hope is well How does ye Kitten ? my Compts- there once more adieu God bliſs you
