Edinburgh 26 . January 1775 My Dear Madam , I received your very kind and affectionate Letter a few days ago , and would have answered it immediatly If I had not been prevented by particular busineſs . Our loſs was certainly very great , tho ' at the same time our Greif was entirely selfish , as there was not the smallest prospect of any amendment in his health . The bursting of a blood Veſsel in his breast was the immediate cause of his Death . I was out of town & you may may easily gueſs what my feelings were when my Sisters sent an expreſs for me to come home , but before I arrived it was all over . But it is my duty to be resigned and to submit to the will of God , he gave Life & he has a right to take it away . It is neceſsary for me when I consider that I have four Orphan Sisters to protect and provide for , to exert myself as much as is in my power to sooth their Greif and alleviate their afflictions . I will deliver your meſsage to Mainie when I write to her , she is at present at Hopetoun House , but I dare answer in her name as well as my own that we have all the most firm intentions to keep that friendship , which always subsisted between our families , inviolable . I hope to hear by your next that you are better . I beg my best Compts : to Mrs. Hamilton and I am Your Obedient Servant Napier .
