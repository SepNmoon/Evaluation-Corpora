Canterbury Novr , 21 st - 1772 Yours My dearest Mary of the 19 th - ( you made a mistake for it might be dated the 18 th - but if wrote on the 19 th - I could not have go e t it the day after ) came safe to hand last night & am extremely obliged to you for your definition of Friendship tho I am not sure whither you can be right in one thing you ſay , that in the union of Soul & Body our Creator has given the aſcendency in few cases to the former . now I am afraid its ourselves that gives it to the last , we are born with a free Will , we are taught good from evil , & yet too often , if not almost always p refer the evil to the good as the pleaſures of the body are instantanious those of the Soul at a distance & not to be expected in this World , so I am afraid its ourselves not our great Creator that gives the ascendancy to the body , Esteem , friendship & sentimental pleaſures ought to be prefered to the Corporeal ones , tho I do not agree with you when you ſay Will be as I am quite convinced they seldom are prefered to the sensual pleaſures of a Corrupted appetite . May ſuch pleaſures always keep at a distance from My dearest Mary is my sincere Prayer & Wish nor do I fear otherwise knowing her Good ſence , good education , & the good inclinations she has always shewn , she poſseſsed . May your greatest pleasures My dearest Girl be in every thing thats good & then believe me they will be solid & agreeable ones , as nothing is more certain than that an innocent Mind is the greatest pleaſure we can have in this life , or when we remain with this clay cloathing to our Souls . I have unawares My dear Mary rather got into a more serious subject than I attended intended & was this letter to be produced at the Macaroni Club or female Cotterie I am afraid it would be greatly laughed att as nobody would believe that I was writing to a fine young Lady of eighteen years old but to ſome old antiquated virgin of Seventy at least , or that I must be a very old fellow got into my second Childhood that could ſuppose that any thing raional could entertain a sprightly young Lady of this refined age but as I am ſencible that I am writing to one of the Phenix 's & not one of the Babylonians of th e is happy Isle I dont care for cenſure from them if I can write to please the young Lady that I write too & for whom I have a most true & Sincere Love & Friendſhip founded on the most perfect esteem , if I have her appropation & Friendship I am content nor shall I give myself much trouble whither I have theirs or not -- Please tell Mrs Hamilton with my best respects that her collar of Brawn is made , but not long enough , as yet the Maker says , to bear the Carriage to Northampton but she may depend on it as ſoon as poſsible What you write about Lord Cathcart s family I knew before & thought I had wrote you how they were disposed off at heart I did deſign it , but ſuppose I must have forgot it as you write it to me -- Tho you have lost many of your Babylonians from Northampton yet to my knowledge you have got the Seventh Regiment of Dragoons with you & should in my opinion be able to furnish out a good long letter from a young Lady , but perhaps you may keep that ſort of Correspondance for your female friends . was the Kitten from Northampton she would I make no doubt be informed that a Regiments was come to town ſuch , & ſuch officers , were come , ſome old , others young & handſome & in short we are so Gay or are to be so gay I wish you was here My dear Kitten to partake , is this not true , I pray remember My dearest Mary that I am a jealous friend I wont have any Perſon male or female in that capacity prefered before me in your confidence write me every thing that concerns your Soul , Mind , Heart , & Body without reſerve , I own what I deſire is not eaſy for a Young Lady to bring herself too especially to a Man but believe me she is safer with them if Men of Honor then with any Woman that ever was yet born , dont think I am abuſing your Sex , far from it , its the ſame thing with ours , give me a Lady for my Confidant there I am ſure of your good advice none of your Male Creatures from me & I believe a male Confidant is best for a Lady if she can depend on his honor & I hope my dearest Girl has no ſuspicion off mine where she is concerned what an unconscionable Girl thou are to deſire a monstrous long letter for your short one its true your Babylonians are gone but you have a Regiment that I know ſomething off , in this place we have both Babylonians , & a Regiment , & many fine handſome young Ladys both in town & Country , yet as you know none of them its impoſsible for me to i e ntertain you what with little Anecdotes that may & certainly does happen here as well as at other places , so you see that we are on a footing in regard to matter tho I have the advantage by knowing the Kitten & some other of your Young Ladys at least by name but you think I for safe sake of a little flummery about the art of lenghninglengthning my letters so very agreeably will continue to write long ones for short ones ; at the distance of ten , twelve or fourteen days , when I write always the very next after I get yours , No , No , Madam , I must be treated with more dignity otherwise this is my last long one , so see to it , & mend your Manners , otherwise I can use people as they use me tho I own it would be more of a Christian dispoſition to return good for evil , but a worm will turn if traid upon -- its very true I am more than partial to my dear Mary but I wont spare her when she thinks , or writes , any thing I do n't like , flattery is a kind of Sweet Meat that goes down I am afraid too often , which makes people think it ought always to do so , indeed when it comes from a different Sex its more thought off , but with no greater degree of Justice ought it to be so , at the ſame time Friendship may often , nay very often dictate sentiments thats so strong that many people may & would call it flattery were they to see it , but they ought to consider that true Friendſhip is truth itself & never deſigningly flatters , tho very often may lie under that cenſure I own my dear girl that you may retort upon me from what I have just ſaid , as I ought not to doubt yr Friendship so what you wrote ought not to be taken for flattery , true , true , but actions shew Friendship best , write me long letters & believe me but that Love & Friendship will always furnish out materials for twenty sheets ; perhaps ſome time in your life you may own it to me , but that time may perhaps not have touched your Heart as yet . Between you & I , I dont believe thats the Case of your friend the Kitten as in my opinion her heart is not so very easy as she would willingly make People believe , but I dont deſire to know any particulars that she may have told you , as I would think it was ungenerous to betray Confidence in any shape , I would have my Girl perfect , & even to one , who I hope she looks upon in a different light from any other , I would not have her discover what she ought most secretly to conceal , tho at the same time I would advise her never to have secrets of her own or of others , disclosed to female friends , as then on little piques between the friends things never can be carried to an extremity this your own good sence will tell you much better than any bodys writing -- what I 've said of the Kitten is meer conjecture from her bad state of health I may be distaken & hope I am -- Poſsitively I wont write more & if I have not a long monstrous letter within a few days I ' ll conclude you dont Like me to write to you so often , so now its all in your o w n power so do as you please , only believe My dearest dearest Mary that I am & always will be your most faithfull & affectly- yours W : N.—— To Miſs Hamilton near Northampton
