Dear Miſs Hamilton Your letter of the 3 d . of this Inst . which I receiv 'd yesterday has reliev 'd me from much anxiety on your account ; what you say of your present state of health , and of the attention that you experience is highly satisfactory to your Friends , as they must esteem it as the best testimony , that your conduct is approved of . I have been settled at my House within 3 miles of Dublin since the 20 th . of May last & find it in every respect a most agreeable & convenient residence , the situation can not be excell 'd as it commands the view of the Bay of Dublin with the opposite Hills cover 'd with Villas . I have a little farm of about fifty English Acres , the half of which is in a Lawn in front of my House , pastur 'd by sheep & other cattle , which enliven the scene & are very useful in other respects . With regard to the small Parish in my neighbourhood which wou 'd be so eligible an acquisition to me , by justifying my absenting myself from my Living in the North of Ireland , of all places in the world the most detestable , I do not see that I have at present any chance of attaining it , so that I am not without my apprehensions of being at last reduced to the neceſsity of giving up that Living , if my residence there shou 'd be insisted upon ; this wou 'd be a very distreſsing reduction of my income , but still of two evils the least . I am truly concern 'd to hear that Ld . Dartrey has met with so great an affliction , this is I believe the second within these few years , for if I remember right he loſs 'd a son by a fall from a horse . Mr. Brown has transmitted me the Papers you mention and I have returned them signed . Tho ' Mrs. Hamilton must enjoy great satisfaction in the thoughts of your present connections , yet she must feel the loſs of the comfort of your society very severely , especially as she does not enjoy a good state of health . I beg you will do me the favor when you write to present my Compts . to her . Poor Mrs. Stratford has disposed of herself very unfortunately to a man of fortune indeed , but so wretched a being that it is impossible for me to keep up any intercourse with him , so that we do not see her as often as we cou 'd wish , she has a daughter about eight months old and is in the way of adding to his family a second time . My second Daughter is a very agreeable Child now ten years old & will I hope be more fortunate than her Sister . My Son is with us and is at last recover 'd from the bad consequences of the inoculation & will be a very well looking boy . When I was mentioning some particulars of this place I forgot to inform you that we mean to make it our constant residence for some time at least , and to paſs the next winter here . I have been at so great an expence in the purchase , additions furnishing & c . that this is a matter more of prudence than of choice Mrs. Hamilton desires to join with me in Compts . & every good wish I am Dear Miſs .
