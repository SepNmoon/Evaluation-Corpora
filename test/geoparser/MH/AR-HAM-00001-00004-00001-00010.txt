Mr. F. Hamilton July 1779 Dear Miſs Hamilton I have deferr 'd thanking you for your very obliging letter much longer than I intended ; it was partly occasioned by our having been in expectation of seeing Lord & Lady Dartrey before their return to England ; we called upon them in Dublin as soon as we heard of their arrival but did not find them at home ; the next day we receiv 'd a card from them apologizing for their not having it in their power to come to Latour , as they were to embark for England immediately . I do not wonder that they shou 'd be in Country where we are under the most alarming apprehensions ; having more to fear , shou 'd an invasion take place from our internal enemies than from our Invaders ; the Country which was miserable enough before , is hurt extremely by the expectation of that formidable event . Wherever a King 's Son is great attention must neceſsarily be given to him , and I apprehend that at this perilous crisis there is no time for ceremonials . I have always regarded the Q . s conduct in general as well as her behaviour to her Dependants to be superiorly judicious as well as very gracious ; had it fortunately been my lot to have remained so long under her observation as that she might have become acquainted with the foundation of my expectations , I am persuaded I shou 'd not have been so long neglected , nor to have cause to lament at the age of 50 , that royal Promises , so often repeated , shou 'd have had so little effect , or that I bear a Name which serves only to remind me that I have been singularly unfortunate . You see I speak my sentiments to you without reserve , you need therefore make no apology for doing the same to me ; be aſsured Dr Miſs Hamilton that I am most sincerely interested in your welfare I was formerly very intimate with Mr Lyte and have a great regard & affection for him , I beg you will remember me to him . I expect Mr Huband will soon have it in his power to make you another remittance , if money is as hard to be got in England as it is here you will not be surprized at his delay . We have had for these ten days past the hottest weather that was ever rememberd in Ireland , but as I am in a most beautiful situation in full view of a delightful Bay , the heat is moderated by refreshing breezes from the sea . I lament that Ld Dartrey did not see my Villa , as I am sure he must have been struck with its beauty . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be affectionately remember 'd to you , poor Mrs Stratford , I have not seen her these three months , she is married to a savage , I have no sort of intercourse with her husband , She wou 'd have him in spite of all my remonstrances ; My second Daughter is a charmin g Girl in every respect with excellent abilities . My Son is perfe ctly recover 'd and is a very handsome fine looking Boy his name is Robert , why name him Frederick ! Adieu Dr Miſs Hamilton belive me ever Your Most faithful and Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton July 15 th . 1779 Latour Clontarf near Dublin Miſs Hamilton at Prince Ernest 's House Kew Surry
