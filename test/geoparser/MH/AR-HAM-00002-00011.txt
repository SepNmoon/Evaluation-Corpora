Lord Cathcart is to let his Sister have -- by these pictures & from what I have heard Lady Archibald must have been a H very elegant pretty Woman . at 10 oClock I came away . Had Lady S 's Coach . call 'd on ye . Glovers -- they were gone to bed . came home sat wth . Miſs Clarkes till ½ past 11 . A M . told me ye . Glovers had been to our house & ye . reasons of our not meeting them this Eveg . I sat up till 2 oClock in ye . Morng . wrote a long letter for tomorrows post for to Mr. D : Dſs . Argyll has resign 'd her Place as Lady of ye . Bedchamber -- on account of her very declining health . Lady Harcourt kiss 'd hands on Thursday Yesterday on being appointed in her Room . Saturday 10 th . July 1784 Wrote to Lady Clavering & Mrs. -- Garrick . settled some important triffles , wth Anna Maria , took leave of her & Isabella at 1 o'Clock when Mr. Pepys came for me . Mrs. Pepys Mrs. Walsingham & c had aſsured me of their approbation & that I I had their sanction for going with an old acquaintance , and a married Man of perfect good character without a Chaperon . We had a pleasant airing to Thames Ditton where we arrived at 3 oClock . Mr .. P : amused me by relating a number of curious Anecdotes . I can not boast of recollecting them for my thoughts were too often wandering into Ds shire for me to pay the attention th is conversation merited . I make no doubt yt .. he was perfectly well satisfied with me as a fellow travēler -- for people that love to talk themselves require nothing more from one than a look of attention -- the words yes & no , a well tim 'd smile -- a grave face & c. & c . It is a much easier matter to please than some will allow . Sometime or other I will write down my thoughts on this subject -- I detest art of every kind but it is a duty we owe society to t appear perfectly attentive to every one . Mrs. Walsingham expreſs 'd so much joy at seeing me that I believe it was sincere . She shew 'd us ye . improvements in the house before dinner -- & in ye . most flattering manner surprised me by shewing me ye . elegant decoration & new furniture of ye . Dreſsing Room to a Bedchamber wch .. is always call 'd Miſs H—— 's as is also a seat in ye . shruberry wch . commands a View of ye . Thames . There was no other Company at Dinner than Miſs Boyle ( her only daughter who is at ye . age of 14 one of ye . most accomplishd Young Person I ever met with -- She is mistreſs of Music -- & painting -- Models in a surprising Manner -- knows perfectly Modern & Ancient History French , Italian -- Geography , Mathematics -- Astronomy ye . English Claſsics -- is learning Spanish & Latin & c. though I think Miſs B : will reap many advantages from having received so very superiour an education , I fear it will prevent her enjoying the innocent pleasure of society for every other female will not only envy but be afraid of her , & the Men in general are so jealous of our being as wise as themselves that they will shun her , None will aſsociate wth- her but Colledge Pedants or rigid Philosophers or pretended Femmes Savantes -- & an affected Femme Savante is in my opinion a most disagreeable animal -- the reason of this is that they always pretend to more knowledge than than they have , that they are ignorant of what they ought to know , are part affected & useleſs members of society the only Woman that I know whose talents deserved the highest cultivation is Mrs : Carter -- she is I imagine ye . most learned female that ever lived -- hers is not a mere superficial knowledge -- & she is , most wise & Good -- I must not now indulge myself with writing an eloge on this Dear Woman the subject would carry me too far . Miſs More & Mrs .. Chapone & two or three others I could name whom I likewise would except out of ye . list of what I call Femmes Savantes . for their talents & amiable precepts have been of great service to society . After dinner we went to ye . Medaillion Seat , where we had our Coffee . & sat till tea time , we also drank tea here , the paſsing objects such as pleasure boats , Barges & c -- on the River & the Carriages on the opposite shore made an agreeable variety . this Villa is on the Surry Side immediately opposite Hampton Court Palace 2 of ye . Pavilions are ye . principle object ye . Palace is hid behind the Trees , the Terrace of ye . Palace Garden is so high that wth . the a Telescope from this Seat one can easily distinguish who are walking there if one is acquainted wth . them . After Tea we walk 'd in the Shruberry & round the Ferme orné wch . is laid out with as much taste as 42 Acres of flat ground can well be . Mrs- Walsingham has just begun to build a conservertory wch . will be an agreeable addition to ye . House as it will open into a China Closet wch . opens into ye . largest drawing Room . We came in at 9 o'Clock . Mrs. Walsingham treated us with Reading Paſsages from some of ye . Manuscripts she has in her poſseſsion -- one in particular was a curious account of transactions in Ruſsia wch . Mrs. W : had taken down in Short hand from a relation Mrs. Vigo had given her who was in Russia when Jane Vigor was murder 'd by the orders of ye . Czar . as this is now so generally known I shall not enter into ye . detail . at 10 o'Clock we went to Supper ye present Empreſs retired as soon as ye . Cloth was removed . Miſs Boyle Mrs. W : & I sat up till 1 o'Clock -- ye . conversation was so interesting that Mr P : forgot the hour as ye . rule of her House is to separate at 11 oClock -- she accompanied me to my Room where she repeated her kind profeſsing Mrs. W . is a Widow & daughter of the very celebrated Mrs. W : , & Mr. Charles Hanbury Williams -- she has a great portion of her father s Wit -- is more inform 'd than most women & is very highly accomplish 'd -- she is esteem 'd by ye . judges to be first Lady Painter . Lady Frances Coningsby must be admired for her talents -- & if she made more allowances for those who had not so strong a mind & c. & c . as herself she would be more loved . She is keen & sometimes severe & wants a certain softneſs , without wch . no female can appear truly amiable . Was I to make my opinion of her public I should be very ungrateful for she has from my our first acquaintance been perfectly equal to me & I believe has as great a share of affection for me as she is capable of feeling for any one . tho ' I think we should be careful not to censure the failings of others or get into habits of detraction yet it is of great use to investigate every character that falls under our own observation -- Reading the characters of ye . living often affords better instruction than reading whole volumes of ye . observations of others & c & c . & c Mrs. W . has a very large fortune in her own power , I have been told 5 or 6 Thousand pr . An : besides Money -- she has every thing in stile , lives like a person of fashion & She is a good œconomist , & tho she lives expensively not extragavantly . Sunday 11 th . July 1784 Thames Ditton I got up soon after 6 when I was dreſs 'd went into ye . Garden , I took a book wth- me , but I could not engage my thoughts to its contents I read some letters I had in my pocket . I enjoy 'd ye . thoughts that perhaps the writer of them was then thinking of me -- I also endulged ye . hopes that ye .. time would arrive when we should together enjoy every pleasing scene -- that we might sometime or other together admire ye . beauties of Nature & adore that Being who has so bountifuly stredwd his bleſsings over this World . if it should not be permitted yt . we shall enjoy this happiness -- that same Being will I doubt not support our minds to bear the disappointment properly . Mrs. W . join 'd me ¼ before 9 in ye . Garden , she shew 'd me her Birds & ye . Nests she had found -- we fed those that were become tame . At 9 we all met at Breakfast after wch . Miſs Boyle Mr. P : & I strolld about ye . Garden -- Miſs B : join 'd us at 11 -- we went to Church -- after wch . Mrs. W—— said we should not separate as we were to make so short a stay . we sat together in ye . Medaillion Seat & amused ourselves with conversing & looking through the Telescopes till 3 -- at 1 we had an elegant little Repast brought of fruits Cakes & Ice Water . I left Mrs .. W : & Mrs. W at 3 Mr. P : Maid attended me & dreſs 'd my hair -- as I did not take my own Maid -- At 4 oClock I join 'd them in ye . Garden -- Mrs. W : was arrived -- but alas ! no Mrs. Garrick he had sent his excuse being ill . Mr .. Walpole ( Mr. Boyle only Son ) came from London to dine & sleep stay till tomorrow -- I had not seen him these 3 years -- he having been in Ireland wth . his Uncle Mrs. W : ( his father s Brother ) Lord Shannon is in his three & twent ieth year a handsome lively wellbred & I believe sensible Young Man , he is in ye . Guards -- I have heard that he is diſsipated & extravagant -- but how few how very few Young Men are otherwise ! -- Mr. B : & her Eldest daughter the Ducheſs of Bolton also came to dinner -- Lady Catherine Pawlet is a great favorite of mine she is natural lively and unaffected -- She is about 16 in all ye . bloom of youth ! & though I do not agree wth . others that she is a very great beauty , I think her a handsome Young Woman she is above ye . common size is well form 'd & has a good air . . . as we waited for ye . Dſs . we did not set down to dinner till near 5 -- Lady Catherine s resignation and the Ducheſs of Argyle s appointment as Lady of ye . Bedchamber to Lady Harcourt was ye . principle topic with other tattle of the day -- such as the run away Match of ye . Queen & Mr. Fritzroy Miſs Laura Keppel & c. & c I could not help laughing at the very pathetic letter ye . Prince of Wales told us wch . ye . Dſs . of B—— wrote to ye . Prince when she found her Daughter was run away -- “ My Child , my Child Oh I have lost my Child -- what is become of my Child -- Oh come & comfort & tell me where is my Child ” -- the Prince went & comforted ye . distreſs 'd Mother & sat with her till 2 in ye . Morng . Mrs. Keppel had sat tête a tête with her Daughter the whole afternoon -- Mrs .. Keppel having refused to go wth . her Sisters to Ranelagh ... her eyes were red with weeping as Miſs Laura had refused to give her consent to her marrying Mrs. K : Mr. F : endeavour 'd to comfort her daughter and to amuse her read the very Moral & instructive Novel of the Sorrows of Werter . They separated at 11 -- Mrs. K : this tender judicious sensible Mother charged her other Daughters when they came home not to make a Noise or laugh quite so loud as usual for that ye . poor afflicted Mrs .. K : was gone to try by sleep to forget her Sorrows & those of Werters . but to their great surprise when they paſs 'd her Chambers door it was open & Laura was fled . As soon as we rose from table we went to the M : Seat after Coffee we separated walk 'd about , conversd without form or restraint , I had ye . pleasure of enjoying some private conversations with my dear & agreeable friend Laura she shoew 'd me a letter of our friend Mrs .. Garrick s. I really do not know a more pleasing Woman than Miſs More She is a model of perfect grace & good breeding -- there is a propriety in her manners & conduct wch . convince you she is a Woman of sense & she is so open so candid so engenuous so free from affectation & Art that is impoſsible to be ½ an hour in her company without loving her . She made me promise to introduce a certain friend of mine to her & said she shd . invite us to Hampton -- & that she should invite my Mrs. G : ( wth . whom she has been many years acquainted ) to meet us & c & c & c Uncle William ye . Dſs .. & Mrs. G : left us at ½ past 8 -- we saw Lady Catherine on ye . opposite Shore who went to pay a Visit to ye . beautiful ye . Prince of W—— who lodge in ye . Summer in the Pavilions . before supper we amused ourselves in looking over the Prints belonging to Lady Waldgraves s Voyage , Cook entertain 'd us at ye . same time by reading ye . descriptions & c Mrs .. W : Mrs. W : Mr. Boyle & I sat up till near 1 o'Clock Mr. Pepys ye .. Late Provost of Eaton & c & c were the persons whose characters afforded us ample matter for conversation . Mr Coombes & Mrs. Garrick were spoke of by the Ducheſs Dowgr . of Portland as they merited some other time I will amuse myself in making memorandums of the strange anecdotes relative to Mrs. W : : Coomes would attend me to my Room . She preſs 'd me to fix a time for make her a longer Visit -- this I could not do but I promised to let her know as soon as poſsible She inform 'd me my Cousin Mrs .. W : ( Miſs Hamilton s Niece ) was to come to her on Wednesday & to stay some time as she is a most amiable & accomplished woman I shall endeavour to go to Lord Abercorn before she leaves her . Monday 12 th . July 1784 I join 'd Mrs. W : before breakfast -- & got her to play a leſson to me -- she plays as if she was was perfectly well grounded & understood what she play 'd but I do not think she has much taste or feeling . We met at 8 o'Clock to breakfast -- we breakfasted an hour earlier as Miſs Boyle was obliged to set out at 9 o'Clock Mr. Pepys gain 'd great credit for joining us so early . Mr Boyle charged me to remember my promise of paying her a longer Visit & told me how many plans she had of going to see places & c wch . she & her daughter should not enjoy if I was not of ye . party . at 9 o'Clock Mrs .. W : & I set out , we had an interesting conversation he quite gain 'd my heart by the manner in wch . he spoke of his Wife & children .
