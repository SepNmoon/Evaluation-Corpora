Harleyford . March 8 th . 1780 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton , It was not in my power Yesterday to add a Line to you of thanks for your pretty affectionate Letter , when I return 'd the Manuscript you was so good as to send , which entertain 'd me & all here vastly . Nobody can be more sensible then I am to all the kindneſs you expreſs for me , or more sincerely return it . but my present State makes me incapable of expreſsing or doing any thing as I ought , so I hope all my friends will pardon my Defficiencies . I must rejoice however about the happineſs caused by P. William s return , thō I feel vastly being debarr 'd my Share in it . I do not find the least Amendment in my head & that you know was my dread from the beginning of this disorder , for without the hopes of getting rid of that , how can I look forward with any Satisfaction . These Thoughts every body tells me I must banish , but they will intrude in such a Situation as mine , where inability must destroy all my powers of being useful , & consequently of being happy . I know the good hearts of the K . & Q . & have experienced it in a thousand Instances , but the more I feel that , the more I must be hurt . Adieu my dear I will not wear your Spirits with my Distreſs , wch . I know you will feel the more as you can not relieve it . Adieu ever most Affly . & Sincerely Yrs . CFinch I have by mistake begun on a half Sheet so can not seal it which is very awkward To Miſs Hamilton St James 's
