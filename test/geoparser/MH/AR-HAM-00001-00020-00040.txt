Edinburgh 13 th : Novr- 1780 . On Monday next I propose leaving this agreable City , but have not the smallest intention of paying my respects to You in person 'till the next Birthday , so that you must at last suspend your joy at the idea of seeing me 'till that distant period . You pretend to be very much occupied with attendance on the P. R . I can aſsure you I am no leſs so , in preparing for my departure ; and as I think it not improbable that I may visit the West Indies before my return to Scotland , I have given up my house and have been and still am occupied very busy arranging my Affairs . Upon my arrival at Welwyn I shall write to you , but 'till I do so shall not expect to hear from you . This permiſsion to be idle , will I suspect be perfectly agreable to your lazyneſs . Are the people south of Tweed distracted ? What did Ld . Beaulieu mean by his behaviour to the D of Montagu . He ought to be forbid to appear in the Royal presence -- Prince Frederick 's military promotion & intended journey pleases me . I hope both he & the P. of W . will have sensible men about them . Young ones will ruin them both . Ld . & Lady Cathcart arrived here a fortnight ago . They are at Shaw Park , but I expect them in Edinr- tomorrow in their way to London . Lady C . is by no means a Beauty , but has something very pleasing in her Countenance . They both seem happy & conten d ted . The D. of A . proposes to loiter away his time in the Country till after Christmaſs . I like your character of Mr- Farhill as much as I formerly liked him , and really long to meet with him . I had almost forgot to tell you that J . Hope is at his father s , he enquired much about you & threatens to write to you . He goes to England in a few days . Adieu . Beleive me ever yours very sincerely & affectionately N——
