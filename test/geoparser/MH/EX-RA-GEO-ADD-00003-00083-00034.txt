Decbr- 17 -- Sent . Thursday 30 th - to be given ye 31 st For the love of Heaven Stop , O stop my friend ! & do not thus headlong plunge yourself into vice . Yor . last Letter Note & ye prece e ding one made every nerve of me thrill wth . horror apprehension -- I had determin 'd to say nothing further upon ye . subject fearing it wld- be in vain & hoping yor reason wd- prove a sufficient guard -- but You listen not to ye . voice of reason -- & Alas ! will no t longer I fear to yt . of friendship . I conjure yo- strive to conquer this unhappy infatuation -- where are fled those sentiments of Honor & virtue wch . made yo . appear in so amiable a light ? who can have been so infamous as to teach yo . such detestable doctrines ? you are preparing wretchedneſs for yourself -- you are drawing others in to share it -- if you will not acknowledge this now -- there will come a time when you will keenly feel it -- for you have a mind capable of reflection & a heart too good ever totally to eradicate ye love & admiration of wt . is virtuous & amiable I know you better than yo do yourself -- you will repent -- but perhaps it will be then too late . -- Look round ye . world my friend -- see wether ye . votaries of vice are to be envied -- ask if they are happy -- you will find ym- a set of miserable wretches , & if you cld- poſsibly discern what they must at times feel -- it wld . strike you wth- terr ror dread . Ask your heart if you are willing to sacrifice every amiable & good quality -- to give up those ( yor once favorite quotation ) “ self approving hours ” Pope Essay on Man , Epistle IV for remorse & self reproach . for N n o joys can be permanent yt . have not self approbation for their basis . You alledge ye . poor undone object of your present paſsion has already trod ye . paths of vice , can yt . be a reason for your endeavouring to sink her immortal soul still deeper in perdition ? -- the idea makes me tremble ; -- I have yor . eternal as well as temporal happineſs at heart -- & I can not check its effusions -- I know what you will suffer hereafter & I exert my endeavours to save my friend to recall you to yourself -- If they are without effect , -- I must submit to have my admonitions treated wth- contempt -- & myself laugh 'd at for my presumptuous folly in having an opinion in these matters different from ye . gay votar y ies of fashion -- but I shall have a pleasure they can not taste , yt . of acting in ye . most disinterested manner & speaking with sincerity & truth . -- They will flatter your follies -- they will encourage your vices -- I point out ye one -- & I & warn you against ym . ye other -- They want to sink you to a level wth . themselves -- I want to raise your Virtues -- for you have virtues -- let ym . not lie dormant but shew yourself superior to ye . World -- you can -- you may -- you ought to be so . -- My heart is torn wth- anguish upon your account -- I am your Friend & as such must feel -- I now bid you Adieu -- I have done my Duty as your friend & take my leave of you till you are restor 'd to yourself . Adieu May all ye Bleſsings of Heaven attend you De-grace ceſsez de m'écrire , sauvez moi de l'affront de mépriser de que j'ai cru digne de mon estime Adieu Jai prévû votre changement , il màfflige , mais il ne me surprend pas pour moi je ne changerai jamais . Daignez vous souvenir quelquefois de mon amitié , & N n e craignez pas que je vous faſse jamais des reproches -- je ne pleure plus de moi que de vous
