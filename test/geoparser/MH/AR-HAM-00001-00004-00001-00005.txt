Dear Miſs Hamilton I was much concern 'd to hear by a letter I receiv 'd yesterday from Miſs Clarke that you had lately been so much indisposed & had been so unfortunate as to have relapsed after having been nearly recover 'd from a former illneſs ; I shoud suffer the greatest anxiety if Miſs Clarke had not aſsured me that you were recovering fast and regaining your appetite by the benefit of the Country air . I hope you will not suffer again by an impatience to return to your attendance , before you find yourself perfectly restored , nor suffer yourself to be too anxious upon that subject ; you may be sure that a very hasty return will not be expected as it must take a certain time before the strength & spirits can be recover 'd after such an illneſs , when that time comes I hope to be favor 'd with a letter from yourself . I have been much engaged for some time past in making preparations for my residence at a place about three miles from Dublin which turns out far beyond my expectations as it is indeed uncommonly beautiful & the House is answerable to it , we propose to remove there by the end of next month . I have been so long a dupe to expectations of further Preferment , which I had certainly great reason to expect in as much as they were founded upon repeated promises of Persons who might have served me that I now entertain but small hopes upon that subject . My residence upon my Living in the farthest northern part of Ireland is expected & may probably be insisted upon , which wou 'd be the finishing stroke of my perverse fortune , for as it is situated in a most disagreeable climate in the midst of the most rigid Presbeterian Independants , most of whom wou 'd emigrate to their Friends in America cou 'd they be permitted , I must sooner determine to resign my Living than attend to what is call 'd my duty among a set of People that have an unconquerable aversion to the established Church as well as being by no means Friends to our Constitution . I am labouring if possible to procure a small Living in the neighbourhood of my House near Dublin which wou 'd give me an option in point of residence & with propriety dispense with my removal to a place that I have always abhor 'd . I have applied to the Ld Lieutenant upon this subject but as my request has no other advocate to support it but myself it is not propable that it will meet with succeſs . These are expensive & extravagant times & as I have fixed myself in Ireland for the remainder of my life a gratuitous surrender of my Living wou 'd be a measure that wou 'd not meet with the approbation of my Friends , tho ' I own I cou 'd wish my circumstances were such as to justify my doing it . I can not be thought very greedy or ambitious when my only wish is to realize m y present Income with propriety which I might do by having the a of a small Living in exchange for which I cou 'd procure the one in th e neighbourhood of the Place where I mean to reside for the future . I had a letter lately from Mr. Chas . Brown who is now in London attending an Appeal before the House of Lords he told me he shou 'd make a visit to Mr. Hamilton to whom I beg you will present my Compts . with Mrs. H—— 's My dear Mrs. Stratford is extremely well very handsome , agreeable & remarkably clever but most unfortunately match 'd Adieu . My Dear Miſs Hamilton take care of your health and believe me as I am most Sincerely Your Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Gloucester Street Dublin April 15 th 1778 Miſs Hamilton at Mrs. Hamilton 's James Street near Buckingham Gate London
