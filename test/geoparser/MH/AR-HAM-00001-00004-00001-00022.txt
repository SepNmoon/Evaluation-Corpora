Dear Miſs Hamilton , You will no doubt have been surprised that we shou 'd have permitted you to remain so long in ignorance of what has become of us since we left you ; prepare now for a still greater surprize we mean to set out for England in a few days , for Geneva is now a place of all others the most unfavourable for the residence of Strangers , torn to pieces by internal divisions , which are not likely to subside , and oppreſs 'd by crowds of Foreign Troops . The detail of all the events I have been witneſs to wou 'd lead me beyond the bounds of a letter , I shall therefore defer entering upon the subject till we have the pleasure of meeting . The objects I had in view cou 'd not be answerd at this time in Geneva I therefore judged it more prudent to return without making further experiments . I have objections to France , & still greater to Italy . I have agreed to leave my Son at Geneva under the care of a Man universally respected he is Professor of the Belles Lettres of the Accademy & has educated many Persons already eminent for learning & abilities . I am aſsured he is to be depended upon in every respect ; you may believe that nothing but the hopes of superior advantages cou 'd persuade me to come away without my Son . Mrs. Hamilton is more recover 'd than I cou 'd have expected & will I hope be soon perfectly well she desires with my Daughter to be affectionately remember 'd to you I am Dear Miſs Hamilton , Your faithful & Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Sécheron , near Geneva July 24 th . 1782 .
