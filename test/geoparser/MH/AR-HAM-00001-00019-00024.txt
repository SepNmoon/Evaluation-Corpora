Canterbury Decr , 2 d . 1772 Yours My dearest Mary of thursday morning ( as dated ) came Safe to hand last night and I promise you not to deſire long letters from you again unleſs you are reſolved not to turn every thing I write against me you ſay I have chagrined you , recollect the two first pages of the letter I have now lying before me and I make no doubt but your own justice will oblige you to own that I have more reaſon , what a fine Character you give of me , you could eaſily retaliate upon me did you not know by experience if you did not that it would have no effect on me does not that inſinuate that I do not pique myself in writing truth to my friends but ſince you do not like truth from me ( as upon my honor I never wrote one single word to you that I did not think you deſerved ) I shall for the future write falsehoods , to begin you are no Phenix of the Age so dont believe a word I wrote about that , I have not the least regard , Love , or friendſhip , for you , I really can say no worse of you so shall drop the subject as far as answering your letter will allow me . Be aſsured I shall never again unleſs you deſire me , Mention a Regiment or officers whither they be old , young , or Handſome , had you not deſire d some time ago to be informed about them I should very likely never have thought on them , & I thought it was natural enough to inquire who they were at N that I might have given you a more ſatisfactory anſwer then I was capable off before they arrived eſpecially as I am almost a Stranger to the most of them , but away with ſuch Stuff you really my dearest Girl made a great mistake or I have wrote what I never deſi gn ed , what I mea n't by female Correspondants was not to you , it was entirely in a figurative stile supposing a chit , chat , letter from two Miſses that had sworn the greatest F riendſhip for each other which the flirting of a Fan put an end too at once . But as you have quite mistaken my meaning in every one word where you are concerned I must lay it all to the deſiring a monstrous long letter , that put you out of humour ( if thats poſsible ) if I dare use the expression after what I promised above ) or to the dull dreary month of Novr , in which other Nations ſay we hang our selves in I did bid you write without reserve & hope you will always do so to me as nothing I know I like so well from those I have a regard for -- Hold I forgot I have no regard for you nor do I care what you write . But I find I am always making blunders ſ o the best thing I can do is to beg you 'll preſent my best Compliments and Wiſhes to Mrs Hamilton & believe that I am not , or ever was , your most sincere or affctly- yours & c -- Wm Napier Miſs Hamilton may expect her puppy some time next month or beginning of Feby- providing Povey has any that I think is worthy to be ſent here .
