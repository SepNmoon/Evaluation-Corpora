Wilton Lodge 24 th . Octr- 1794 . My Dear Sister , Having escaped from my Troops , I arrived here the 5 th . Inst- and as a reward for doing so , Maria presented me with a Son , this morning . She had a remarkable easy , and expeditious labour , which has hitherto been unusual with her . At a venture , I direct this to Birch Hall . Was there not a promise given that I should hear from certain Wanderers on their return there . Had I written yesterday , I should have scolded , but I feel so happy at Maria 's situation , that I am in good humour in spite of myself . Our Uncle Sir Thos . Clavering died last week . About six Years ago , he executed a deed bequeathing to Maria & I , £1500 . This he gave me to read . In July last , he made a new Will , and to compleat the history of my Legacy 's , left us out in his remembrances . Pray , if you have any affection for Me , never think of putting down my name in your Will . All my good fortune came to Me in the shape of a Wife , & so I have nothing further to expect . Adieu . God bleſs you . Give my Love to Mr. Dickenson , as many kiſses as You please to my Pet Louisa , and pray dont forget my civilities to Miſs Morrison . Ever My Dear Sister , Your faithful friend and Affect . Brother Napier . Lord Napier 24 Octber 1794 Birth of Charles Mrs= Dickenson Birch Hall Manchesterxx xx xx By Carlisle
