My dear Friend ! A multitude of Engagements , among the principal of which I reckon the concerns of my poor Poeteſs , have so filled up my time and occupied my mind , that I have hardly had leisure to write a line even to You . I honour you for the warm Sensibility you discover in the cause of this delightful Enthusiast ; but I shall not take advantage of your feelings to pick your Pocket because I well know how many demands your bountiful heart has upon its generosity ; but tho I sha n't allow your own Purse Strings to open , yet I shall be thankful to You to aſsist me in untying those of some of our friends when You get to Town , and dear Mrs. Carter has offered her aſsistance , in the same cause And did the charming Duchess and her charming friend Mrs : Delany really shed tears over the wild Wood Notes of this moaning Nightingale ? That testimony to her talents and her distreſses , is beyond all words . I have written on her Subject to our friends Mr. Walpole , Mrs. Boscawen , Mr. Smelt , Mrs. Montagu Pepys and a few others who very kindly offer me their Aſsistance and have begun a little Subscription . I am exceedingly at a loſs what to do with her ; she has Six pretty little children and a husband so stupid as to be incapable of any but the most slavish and least profitable employments ; she is eight and twenty , slender and not ill made ; her face plain but not disagreeable , her countenance rather pensive than sad , her pronunciation vulgar and provincial , but her taste uncommonly accurate and her Sentiments very noble , And we have had an opportunity of discovering that her principles are haughtily just . The Night - Thoughts and the Paradise Lost are the Two Poems which she is best acquainted with , and on which she has formed her own Style and the Structure of her Verse . But the holy Scriptures , that rich and inexhaustible Treasury of divine Wisdom and Knowledge , have been the chief Object of her Study , and the Source of her Information These have inriched her language , & enlarged her Conceptions ; and I am charmed to see how much an illiterate Christian rises superior to all the Wit and learning , and Wisdom falsely so called of the Pagan World . -- She knows nothing of John Milton but his Eloisa , and Pope was quite new to her till I lately put his Tales into her Hands ; with which she is charmed beyond Expreſsion I shall inclose as large Extracts from her Poems as the Frank will bear , en attendant that I can have the honour and pleasure of shewing the whole to your noble Hosteſs , dear Alexander Pope or Yourself . I have some thoughts , if my friends do not disapprove it , of publishing a smal l Volume in the Spring of the best of her Poem s and that I doubt not will bring in a tolerable Sum , but I have not determined about this To morrow I go to Bath to Dryden for a few days ; but any letter directed t o me at Bristol before the 5 th . of Decbr . will find me . About that time I propose to go to Hampton . My best respects attend Your excellent Party Adieu my dear Friend Yours most faithfully and affectionately Mrs. D . Bristol Nov 24 th .
