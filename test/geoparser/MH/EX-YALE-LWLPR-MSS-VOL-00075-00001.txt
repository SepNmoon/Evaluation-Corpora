St James 's Place 7 th Novr 1780 The kindneſs of your heart my Dear Madam is truly gratified , and I am more obliged to you than I can expreſs -- nor can I find words to shew how gratefully sensible I am of the high Honour the Queen has done me by bestowing on me a lock of her Beautiful Hair ; so precious a gift is indeed inestimable ! I am entirely at a loſs to know in what manner to pay my Duty and humble acknowledgements , and must rest on that most kind attention and affectionate regard , which procured me such a treasure , to set me in such a light as may make me appear not entirely unworthy of it . I shou 'd have given myself the pleasure of waiting on you this morning , but my Weakneſs and the Weather will not permit me but if Miſs Hamiton cou 'd call in S t . James 's Place it will add to the Happineſs of her most Obliged & Obedt and give me leave to say Affcte Mary Delany I shall be a home all the Evening & return Morrow to Bulstrode To Miſs Hamilton S t James 's Palace
