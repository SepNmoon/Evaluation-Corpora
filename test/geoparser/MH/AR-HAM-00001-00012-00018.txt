Harleyford Friday Night My Dear Miſs Hamilton I waited for the opportunity of Mr Feilding s return , to send you back the pretty Entertaining Manuscript you was so good to entrust me with , it has not suffer 'd in my hands , but some of the Leaves got a little wet in coming by the Post that rainy Day , but I dried them very carefully , & hope they have suffer 'd as little as poſsible . pray give my Duty at the Queen 's Houſe , I hope tomorrow will bring me a good Account of all there & particularly of Princeſs Elizabeth . I shall take the first opportunity of answering P. Ernest s Letter & beg you will thank H.R.H . from me for it . I have nothing new to say about my health , so will only add Lady Louisa 's kind Compliments to you , & which she reproaches me with having omitted the last time I wrote to you . She has shared in the Amusement of the pretty Manuscript I am ever my Dear Miſs Hamn Most Affly . Yrs . CFinch Remember me to all my Friends at the Queen 's House
