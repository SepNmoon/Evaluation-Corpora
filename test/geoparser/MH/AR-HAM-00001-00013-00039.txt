Sunning Hill July 11 th : 1786 The melancholy contents of this letter my dear Mr .. Dickenson will break in the best manner he is able to his amiable wife , Alas , my once lov 'd & dearest friend Mrs : Jackson is no more , she departed from this world of sorrow & anxiety on Monday at two o'clock ; She was better after her first attack & the Wednesday before she died she said to Mrs : Barnard , though I feel much better to day I may have a relapse , I wish to receive the sacrament , she did receive it , & bore her journey to Harwood last thursday much better than was expected , but when she arrived there she knew nothing of the place , & from that day to her death continued very bad indeed . My Mother wrote to dear A Maria yesterday to beg her to come to us wth : Bell & if she could not come to us that she would go to Town . Nanny is a saint , May the Almighty shower down his bleſsing on her & still inable her to support herself through this this dreadful scene of affliction . I hardly know what I wish & my hand trembles to such a degree that I can scarcely hold my pen , nor should I have written but that I was fearful that Mrs. D—— might see it unexpectedly in a newspaper ; my love to her . I have been ill of a billious fever since I came into the Country , I am better a great deal . My Mother & Mrs. Lenton desire to be kindly remembered to you both Adieu my dear Mr. Dickenson & believe me yr Ever oblig 'd friend M .. Glover P.S .. Let me hear from you soon , dear Mrs : D : what will she not feel , I pity her , I pity myself for I dearly lov 'd the dear Catherine ; but my dearest A. Maria but she is an angel & will be happier than this world could have made her , had she recover 'd , as her illneſs would have ever been been present to her imagenation .
