Christ Church Coll . Oxford August 13 You will have been surprised , my dear friend , at not hearing from me , and you w ill be surprised at the date of this letter . But first let me tell you that a letter of Yours dated 24 July , I never got till the 7 of August , ( our Servant certainly forgot to put it in the Post , ) so of course I made no Answer to questions I did not receive . By miſsing that le tter I was also unprepared to expect the honour Lady and Miſs Kings did me of a very o bliging Visit . I thank you for making me known t o them . They seem very amiable , and I promised m yself that I shou 'd like them much , and we we re to have been very intimate . But , alas ! l'homme propose et Dieu dispose . The oldest friend I have in the world , about four Miles from Bristol sent for me suddenly . I went and found her very near her end ; but going to sleep so gently and so happily , that I found her rather an Object of Envy than of pity . It was remarkable that on that day twelvemonth , I had aſsisted at the death of her husband . I went home , promising to see her again soon ; when I got home I found a letter from my excellent friend Mrs. Kennicott from Oxford , to say that her most pious , worthy and learned Husband , was in extreme danger and that nothing wou 'd give her so much comfort as to see me . There was no hesitating , and in a few hours I found myself in Christ Church . She was the very picture of Woe , but seemed much revived at the sight of me , and that was reward enough for a journey twice as long as that I had taken . I found the good D r . as was supposed at the last extremity , but I thank God , he is now somewhat better ; and we begin to entertain some faint hopes that he may poſsibly recover . God grant he may be restored for the sake of his poor Wife , who is one of the best Women I ever knew ; for his own sake one ought not to wish it , as no doubt a bright reward awaits his long and indefatigable labours in the cause of Christianity . -- Direct to me here and write soon . -- I inclose Louisa 's Narrative . I went to see her last Week . She is grown quite stupid , and looks miserably thin and weak -- I feel , my sweet friend , that I have used You vastly ill about the Verses . I am angry that that wicked Lelius shou 'd contrive to get a Copy & that you shou 'd be still without one . I had fully proposed sending you one , but my journey , and its consequences have never allowed me time to copy it , as Soon as that happens you may depend upon it . -- To my great surprise I received letters from both the Veseys , full of thanks and kindneſs . How in the world cou 'd they know who was the Author ? I have not the smallest gueſs . If you know pray inform me . They plead very earnestly to have it published but I have sent an absolute Negative . I shou 'd d not like it by any means . Adieu I have omitted a thousand things I wished to say , but I write near the bedside of my poor friend , and in a great hurry . I have added a good many lines to the Verses , but have not yet sent them . When you write to dear Mrs. Carter account to her for my long silence and tell her the Child was not returnd when I left Bristol for want of a conv e yance Yrs . affectionately H More
