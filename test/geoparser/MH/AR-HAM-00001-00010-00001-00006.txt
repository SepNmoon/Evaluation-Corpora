3 . 1 . My dearest Miranda , I now sit down to give you a just & faithful account of your dear Mother 's Health , the alteration is within ten days is wonderful -- & I hope as the medicines operate apparently in a very gentle manner , that , their Effect will be permanent , she has taken some pills -- powders -- & drops -- which are not disagreeable to her -- I should have mentioned that , the D r . told her , her disorder was occasioned by an Obstruction , which he believed he could remove , & I think he said that her indigestion & shortneſs of breath were the effects of something collected in her Stomach which he called slime -- She has slept remarkably well for four nights succeſsively -- better than for a long time -- her breath is greatly relieved ; & her appetite good , she has no head-ach nor sickneſs -- she told me to-day that her Legs are swelled -- & that several blisters have appeared on her body below her Stomach this the D r . has been informed of & thinks favourable . she has no pain , & says that had she been a fortnight ago as well as at present -- she certainly should not have sent to Myersbach -- she has been playing at Back-gammon with Catherine & myself -- & appears to have very good spirits -- she has an implicit confidence in the D r : -- What has particularly induced your Mamma to go to Myersbach -- is the surprising effects his medicines have to had on M rs : Warton -- whom I saw in May -- very ill she had a very bad indigestion -- & looked dreadfully -- she has very slight returns of the Indigestion -- & can eat with safety things she has not ventured to touch for years -- her com looks are so improved that every one expreſses surprise who sees her -- she is coming to London to advise with him ag consult him again -- May the truths I have told you my dear Miranda give you pleasure , I shall be very happy to send you intelligence as agreeable in future . I did not perceive that I had written on half a Sheet & meant to have added a few lines . I give you many thanks for your kind Letter , did you know , Miranda , how great the satisfaction with which I receive what you write , you would wish you had opportunities to make me oftener happy . You ask me to give you my sentiments respecting the Event now in suspence , & in which my dear Catherine is so nearly interested I am really not able to judge , her judgement is I think to be depended on & she best knows -- or at least can best judge -- whether she will be happy in giving her hand to Mr : J -- I believe he would make her a good Husband . & I think with you -- that we may presume -- he loves her , his conduct towards my Sister has been that of a Gentleman , & bespeaks him a man of true honour & delicacy -- I do not recommend it to her -- nor do I disapprove of it -- she does not take it unkindly -- that I have not intere taken any part in it , for she knows I love her with tenderneſs Your advice to her was very kind , & you were very amiable in acting as you did , I wish -- ardently to see Catherine happily settled , -- but I should be miserable if I were to chuse for her -- it is I think probable -- that she will accept this Offer , but keep -- this my dear Miranda , within your own breast -- I have another Sister , whom I wish too to to see -- happily married -- if that man might be found who should deserve her . I leave you to gueſs whom I mean -- & I permit you to censure me if I have taken too great a freedom in giving her the name -- yet my Affection might efface the fault Adieu my dear Miranda -- Yours -- Anna Maria Saturday Evening . James Street Bell sends her Love -- your Mamma -- is not able to bear the Carriage now --
