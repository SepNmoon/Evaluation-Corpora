Dover Street July 20 th 1792 After the flattering Encouragement given me by my dear Mr & Mrs. Dickenson the Evening before they left London I was in hopes I wd have heard long since of their Safe Arrival with Miſs dickenson & their sweet little Girl at Taxall -- but having long expected , & as long bien disappointed , I am determined to Enquire Why you have thus disappointed me & why I am so soon forgotten . -- The Town if one may trust to the appearance in the Streets is quite deserted , however I have been at Several large Parties lately -- & have heard the famous Cherubio Sing -- it was not without some difficulty that he was prevail 'd upon to do so so much more however it was a 'd better than most things of the sort Usually turn out -- I have had the pleasure of seeing yr Uncle & Aunt Hamilton from yr . Uncle I had the pleasure of hearing that you had a prosperous journey & that you were all well for I was alarm 'd about you fearing that you or Miſs Dickenson had relaps 'd & yr old complaints return 'd Since you were at a distance from yr Physichin -- how delightful the Country must be this lovely Weather we taste it as often as we can in the Environs of London Dr & Mrs. de Salis are gone to Tring my Mother & I leave London the .9 th . of next Month -- you see that all was quiet at Paris . The Federation day I find the Balls are Equal at the Clubs if the Nobility will be restor 'd or not . tell Mr dickenson , that in Spite of his Loyalty , there are private meetings of Levellers & there were Several commemorations about England but no disturbance -- Lady Herries is gone ( to her Brother 's or Cousin s ) into Kent -- she still hopes to spend the next Winter in Italy -- where I hope she will find all the Health & happineſs she Expects we had see take leave pleasant party at her House . where I most Sincerely miſs 'd you both . Mrs. Charlotte Smith has publish 'd a Novel call 'd Desmond -- Her chief object was to give her opinion of the French revolution , which has caus 'd such an Universal indignation that the Booksellers can not dispose of their Copies -- my indignation arises from the Story which is mix 'd with her opinions -- for I think if there is one Subject more dangerous than another , it is that which makes a Woman Aimiable , who married to one man , is to be in love with another -- she has artfully made the Lover an Angel & the Husband a devil . but my dear Mrs. dickenson what Woman who Suffers her mind to go astray from her duty will not find faults in her Husband , he never poſeſs 'd or perfections in her lover , to which he never had Claims -- this is all very homespun doctrines but I trust they are honest -- alth ' o she does not allow them to do any harm -- so the Paſsion is carried on with great delicacy -- yet there is a diſsimulation , a good mind -- I have had a letter from Mrs. Carter very lately -- she was with the Penningtons & writes in good Spirits -- Lord & Lady Palmerston Sir Charles Blagden & Mrs Mary Carter are all by this time on their road to Dover in their way to Paris -- they were to set out this morning Lord Wycombe s Match with Miſs Raat is certainly off the Story is that he desir 'd her Six thousand a year might be settled on the Title -- if she had no Children , such an instance of Avarice in so Young a Man gives leaves a Woman little reason to regret him -- A dieu my dear Mrs. Dickenson , I beg you will Accept yr self & present to Mr Dickenson my Humble & my United Compliments & best wishes -- Embrace Cordially yr sweet Child & may she be the Comfort of yr old Age -- & allow me to Subscribe my self yr most faithful & Affect Servt . DBloſset NB : th ' o I had a fair opportunity of a Cover for this & have all the year round -- yet I am not Mrs. C——r -- I never pay money with more pleasure than when the Post office is the gainer --
