Dear Miſs Hamilton , I hope you have receiv 'd my last with the enclosed , which I sent by the return of the Post after the receipt of yours . I thought you might have been returned from East Bourne long before this time ; but the news Papers of this week inform me that you are still there ; they must be wrong , the weather has been for some time past too rough & stormy for sea bathing . The same Papers also mention an horrid catastrophe by lightning close to your quarters by which I fear you must have been terribly alarmed . As it is universally understood here that Lord Carlisle is very soon to succeed our Lord Lieutenant , I wrote a few days ago to Lady Stormont , reminding her that the opportunity was now come in which she & Ld . S . agreed an application in my favor might be made with greater probability of succeſs than it coud have been done last winter . I entreated her to use her interest with Ld . S . to second my hopes in the manner that wou 'd be most agreeable to himself , and I hinted at the same time , that if the memorial she permitted me to leave in her hands coud be presented under his patronage , I had great hopes that the truths contained in it , might procure it a favorable acceptance . It appears to me however however that I have no reason to be very sanguine in my expectations , as I have not yet perceived any decided symptoms of zeal in my favor in those Persons who are alone able to serve me . What I wish them to do is certainly proper , & woud do credit to themselves , but this is an argument that wou 'd not become me to pursue further . I hope you have availed yourself of the opportunity of bathing in the sea , which I am sure your friend Doctor Turton recommended to you . I have taken a very good House in Sackville Street which I hope will be ready to receive me by the second week of next month for storms and bad weather seem to have set in earlier than usual . I have been employ 'd during the course of the summer in making considerable improvements to this place which may now be called a very complete Villa . When your are settled in your winter quarters I shall be very happy to hear from you . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be affectionately remember 'd to you . Mrs. Stratford is well & has lately added a Daughter to her family . My Son was here for six weeks and returned to School some time ago , he is in perfect health and is in other respects just as I cou 'd wish him to be I am Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Latour -- Clontarf near Dublin October 9 th . 1780 .
