Cumberland Str eet 1798 My dear Mrs Dickenson I have been daily in expectation of receiving a letter from you , according to your kind promise , as your favor is not arrived I can not at this season , refrain from writing to wish yourself and Family all happine≈øs ; and that each succeeding year may bring you those blessing which are in store for those so worthy of them . What a satisfaction it is to have the means of corresponding with our Friends when at a distance and I am so perfectly convinced of your -- levity that I may without fear of criticism spoil a sheet of paper , in covering it with my silly prose . You said you had abundance of news to communicate you must therefore suppose my curiosity is agog to hear it . My hopes keep pace with my wishes that you will soon let me know how this very cold weather agrees with yourself and dear Louisa , it came on so suddenly with us that yesterday that very few hackney Coaches were to had owing to the Coachmen not having been able to have their horses properlier shod for the frost and tho ' by mere chance we got one to take us to Mr Kinderley 's ( where we dined ) we could not get one to take us home at night we were therefore obliged to sleep there , and breakfasted with them this morning . we met a very agreable party one of whom an intimate friend of Mrs Kinderley 's has invited us to spend Twelfth night with her .
