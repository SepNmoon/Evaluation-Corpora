Wherwell -- Octr- 3 -- 1789 -- I am in perfect charity with You , my dear Mrs- Dickinson , & am very much obliged for your Packet , as well as for your very kind & long Letter ; But till it came , I had feared I had unintentionally given some offence , tho ' I had most unsatisfactorily puzzled my Head to know how . -- I wish it was in my power by this time , to leſsen the Concern I gave You about my Father , but Alaſs , We are just as we were two Months ago , at the beginning of the accident , without having apparently gained one Step in the use of the Leg . He has rather more freedom from Pain , ( whether Rhumatic , or Spasmodic , as it has been named in turn , ) sleeps well , & has no other Complaint , tho ' He is greatly fallen away , & his Spirits are lower than You can have any idea of . We have had another Surgeon from London to see him , who aſsures us that even if my Father was able to be moved there , nothing further could be done for him , that heat & a great length of Time yet , were the chief things to depend upon , that no Bone is any way affected , but that all the Muscles & Ligaments of the Thigh are most thoroughly shook & relaxed , & that till They can gain Strength , an amendment is not to be expected . Instead of trying to exert it as He was at first recommended , He is now advised to give it total rest , so that He continues during the Day , entirely on his Couch above Stairs . I am afraid of the effects of the Winter on him , tho ' his excellent Constitution & Temperance , as You justly observe , are very great preservatives , yet it is a Melancholy Prospect for Him & all of us . Our dear Mrs- Iremonger 's heart is heavy , as You may imagine , under such an Affliction , that is likely to be so continued , yet She is well in Health , & a happy Composure in general sustains her . -- I am very much flattered by Mr- Dickinson 's friendly design to visit me at Bristol , which I wish He had put earlier in execution , & that his bad Health had not impeded his coming on to Wherwell . I am afraid the Soap Pills are not in the estimation that they seemed to deserve when He was here ; & pray thank him for his remarkable levity & politeneſs in overlooking my Blots , but I wish I had not given him such lasting marks of his goodneſs . I had no opportunity of finding out Mrs- Chatterton , & could not learn where She lived ; I suspect her Demesne was not within the compaſs of my Walks . I am particularly pleased with Miſs Berry 's answer to Mr- Walpole , & very much obliged to You for it ; & so I am for your offer of a Copy of Bishop Bonner 's Ghost , which I have not been in the way of seeing & shall most gladly accept to add to my Collection , which You have so kindly enriched . Mr- Warton 's ode on the Grave of Arthur , I am now poſseſs 'd of in Print , together with his other Poems . The Quipos we could not decypher to our Satisfaction . -- I quite hate the information You give me of Dr- Darwin 's being an Infidel in Religion ; How is it poſsible He should be an Atheist , when , from his own very Curious Notes , He must be convinced of the exalted order , ( even to the most extensive minuteneſs , ) & of the wise regularity , of every Law in Nature ? Would not one naturally conclude that the knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame , & of the anatomy of a Plant would both contribute , to raise the mind to a creator , & to confirm most stedfastly the belief ; & yet Physicians to a Proverb , are generally reckoned Free-thinkers . -- The Riddles which I enclose with Your 's , You need not return . Mrs- I—— desires me to make You a thousand acknowlegements for the receipts for the Poor which You sent her ; She begs to detane it a little longer in order to get some Copies printed after it , but it shall be restored to You safely . -- Have You heard that Lord Salisbury is going by a Tontine , to raise £200,000 ? which is the means He is recommended to procure his Estates in his family . He will have £10 , or 12000 p ann . left , besides his Place . Proposals for it , I hear are at his Banker 's in London , & it is tho't it will succeed . Catharine is quite well & sends a Re -buſs to Louisa ; your account of her happineſs & animation at Park-gate , I am sure is to your Heart 's wish . Grandpapa I find is just what He was , & has I hope by this time executed his intention prosperously , of riding 57 Miles to see her ; I wish our Grandpapa here could do the same . With regard to your friendly enquiries after Mrs- Shipley & c , She is well & stout , Miſs Shipley 's Health has been recovered ever since the death of her Father , She is indeed as You imagine , engroſsed in fine Acquaintances , except when She quarrels with them , but her Mother & dear Louisa I am sure are better without her attentions , for tho ' it sounds severe , yet it is not a tittle more than She deserves , to say that I know they never come from her Heart . She is just gone on a Tour to fine friends in the North ; & Mrs- Hare is about to miscarry at Berne ; It does not much signify what becomes of either of Them ; I sometimes think Mrs- Shipley 's is like the Luttrell Family , with only one or Two good Sheep in the Flock , quite different from the rest . If You knew my Louisa as I have known her for 16 Years , You would see the justneſs of my Remarks , & I am sure agree . But she is made up & does not obtrude herself like the rest ; I hope her Health is recovering , but that her Nerves are shaken is no wonder ; She is just set out for Weymouth with her Mother , for the benefits of Mild air as the Winter advances . her Mother 's House at Twyford in this Country , is only 3 Miles on the other side of Winchester from us , & I have been there several times this Summer . My Father is touched with your Expreſsions of Concern for him , & feels thoroughly grateful for your 's & Mr- Dickinson 's Sentiments of Regard . I rejoice sincerely that the air of Park-gate has been so salutary to your good Marito . I suppose He has by this time made himself Master of Italian ; tell him I go on rapidly . We have had your Acquaintance Mr- Collier here this Summer for a few days , who always gives me some instructions . Your 's sincerely & much Obliged E—— Iremonger
