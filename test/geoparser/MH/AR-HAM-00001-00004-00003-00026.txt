35 Aldgate High St : London . Dec : 12 th : 1807 . My dear Cousin , I received your most kind and friendly letter , of the 9 th : , yesterday ; and , lest you should for a moment accuse me of not giving due consideration to the advice contained in it , I will begin by telling you , in my own vindication , that I engaged Lodgings for myself , in Duke Street , Manchester Square , the day before . I should be very sorry to incur merited disapprobation from any one ; but particularly , from such kind and anxious friends as you and Mr : Dickenson : I therefore , ( as you allow me to write without reserve ) will explain the motives for this step ; in which I have proceeded by my dear Father 's expreſs advice . In the first place , ( as I have already mentioned ) the air of Bath certainly does not agree with me : this was a very the most material , but not the only , objection to a constant residence there . My spirits are , of course , so much injured by the affliction I have recently experienced , as to require more diversion of mind , by mixing in the world , than I ever cared for , before . Tho ' I should never enter into what could be termed diſsipation , I could not without deranging my Father 's mode of living , accomplish this ; as he never has a creature in his own house , except morning visitors , or ever goes to any party of an Evening . My coming home , too , ( admitting that I sought an hour 's or two 's relaxation , out ) must disturb him , as his hou time for retiring , is earlier than eleven , and even at Bath , nothing is over , sooner than that . When I was with him , as I did not expect it to last , hoping better conduct from Mr : H . , I made up my mind to accomodate myself to every thing ; but when the prospect changed , he and I , fairly discuſsed the point ; and he agreed that the modes of life of two people of such unequal ages , could not be supposed to accord . But there is still a greater reason than I have yet adduced ; which , as in confidence , I will tell you . If I were to fix myself permanently at my Father 's , Mr : H . would think himself justified in supposing that I wanted for nothing , and I should probably not receive a Sixpence from him . Now , tho ' my Father would not let me want for any thing , there would be no justice in this . However , so unwilling was I to wear the least semblance of want of affection or ingratitude to so kind and generous a Father , that I consulted him as to whether I might not reside in Bath , in Lodgings of my own , in order to be near him ; and finally , begged his decisive advice , saying I would implicitly abide by it , be it what it might . He then counselled my taking a residence to a specified amount , in London , the expence of which he would aſsist me in defraying . I mean to spe nd much of my time with him , tho ' I have it ; but it will be a great convenience , for the purpose of stowing various articles belonging to me that I must now collect , as which would encumber him ; and will further , answer the purpose of removing the idea from the other party , that I am at no expence . I have promised to visit my Father , after I am a little settled , and the weather becomes tolerable ; and , either before or after that visit , I purpose availing myself of your so often repeated cordial invitation . I shall be anxious to know that you and Mr : Dickenson acquit me of blame , upon the explanation I have made . I could even make it fuller , verbally ; but see what room it takes on paper . I must , however , add that when I left my dear Father , I expected the pleasure of seeing him again , in about a week , as he purposed coming to town upon busineſs ; but the busineſs was retarded till the weather broke up , and he then concluded it by letter . Love to my Cousin Louisa . Mrs : Mann desires best thanks for your kind remembrance . Ever your oblig 'd & affecte . Jane Holman P.S . I do not remove for a week . My Sister & Ly : E.
