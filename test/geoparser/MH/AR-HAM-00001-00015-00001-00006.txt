My dear dear Friend -- pray write me a few lines to tell me how you do -- Mr Digby afflicted me very much by telling me that you imagined I was grown cold and indifferent to you , in consequence of the exchange of letters -- How could you for a moment suppose it poſsible -- & how could that in any way influence or alter my sentiments towards you -- are you become leſs estimable or I leſs capable of esteeming & loving your many amiable qualities -- No -- believe me , when I aſsure you that I never was more sensible of them , or more truly attached to you -- & I believe you will agree with me in thinking that friendship does not cool or diminish in proportion as it is independant -- I have every day intended to come to you but my time has been constantly taken up by a circumstance I will acquaint you with when we meet -- it was this which , calling my immediate attention obliged me to diſsappoint you the day we were to have gone into the city -- lest you should mistake the nature of this busineſs , I shall just say that it is about a very distreſsed family , & that you will find mine increased by a very pretty child whom I am going to educate & take care of -- pray give my very kind Compts & amities to Mr D -- who I hear is come -- Mr Digby is quite charmed with his manner & conception so everything is at length settled , I wish you both joy & pray God on my knees to pour on your heads every bleſsing which you both so well deserve -- He knows how sincerely happy I am to think that you will be so soon perfectly so -- adieu , & if any gloom or doubt remains on your mind may the aſsurances of my sincere attachment dispel it -- God bleſs you -- I should have come to day my self instead of writing , but Sir Harry Bridgeman who has some busineſs of consequence to communicate me upon , sends me word that he will be here about 1 or 2 -- write to me some account of yourself , & your proceedings & intentions -- adieu -- I shall go out of Town for two or three days between the Abbey 's next week -- -- Honble Miſs Gunning 5 th June 178 5
