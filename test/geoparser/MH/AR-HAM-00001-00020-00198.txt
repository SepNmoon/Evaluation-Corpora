Wilton Lodge 23 d . April 1805 My Dear Sister , I arrived here on friday Evening , and , this Morning received your Letter if the 16 th . Inst- , in which You seem to reproach my want of distinctneſs , in not explaining where I was going to . It is very poſsible that I may deserve the rebuke , as it is difficult to write on one subject , while you are thinking of another . My mind has been sufficiently tormented both with public & private Matters . As to the public , I need say nothing except , that I have not got any addition to my Salary , & I leave You to gueſs whether the present Times promise much hope to a Scotchman . As to private matters , I have been deep in the Slough of despond . My John , my faithful & attached John , is no longer my Servant . On Tuesday Morning last , I left London , and he left my Service . That Devil Cupid , & that worse devil , a torment of a Wife , has separated us for ever . She plagued him till she extinguished all affection for her , and then , frail Mortality shewed itself . Maria 's Maid had charms in his Eyes , and the approach of a living Witneſs of their indiscretion , obliged her to quit Wilton Lodge , & me to part with John . So , at least four people have been rendered uncomfortable , to say no more . Maria & I have lost two good Servants , & they have lost their peace of Mind . When I was with You , I had not the slightest suspicion of this connexion , but , the Girl told her Mistreſs of it , after my departure . I could now , almost weep about it . I have got John fixed ( I hope ) with a young Scottish Baronet , who will bring him immediately to Scotland , when he will fix on some place for his Wife and three Children to move to . At present , they are here , but , as this Place is mine no longer than the Month of May , we must all decamp . My Rib & Children are well . Tomorrow , Maria & I go to Edinburgh to fix on a house , and expect to return here the end of this Week . From the moment we do so , all will be hurry & confusion , as I must be again in Edinr . by the 10 th - or 12 th . of May , as the General Aſsembly opens on the 16 th - When I look round this Room , and see the operation I shall have in packing up my Books , & no John to aſsist me , it absolutely makes me melancholy . For these last twelve Years , not a book has been dusted but by his hands , or my own . I have got a rational looking Man in his room , but have not put him out of Livery . He stepped into the Post Chaise with me when I left London , & so commenced our acquaintance . I seldom ever speak in a Carriage , and was not more inclined to do so , when my Companion was a Stranger . I dare say , he thinks me a rare sulky fellow . As you will not probably write to me for at least Six Months to come , You may then addreſs your Letter to Edinburgh . I have this day , exhibited the Portrait of Louisa to my Rib . I wish , she could see the original . Perhaps , she may , some time or other , as I have rashly promised the Queen that She will be with me , the next Trip I make to the South . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Love and best wishes from Maria & myself to You , Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , Countrywoman & c. & c. & c .
