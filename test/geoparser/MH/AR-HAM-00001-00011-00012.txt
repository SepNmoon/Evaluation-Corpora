Chelsea Wedy : Morng I can not omit sending an answer my D : Miſs Hamilton to your Letter , which was full of such gracious Meſsages from the Queen & Princeſses , pray present my humble & affectionate Duty , & take an opportunity of informing Her Majesty that the little Book is at length arrived from Bristol & now in the Hands of the Bookbinder -- it is by no means I think equal -- some Sections are much inferior to others all written by a pious Person , but not equally , ( I think to be approved . pray present my Duty to Princeſs Royal & Princeſs Augusta ; & aſsure their Royal Highneſses how sensible I am of their gracious Meſsage , & how happy I shall be to have the Honor of seeing Them again -- & I beg you to tell Princeſs Elizabeth , that I am very grateful to Her Royal Highneſs for so kindly remembering Me , & aſsure her , The Work Bag shall be carefully kept in my Lavendar Drawer -- where I keep every thing I put a high Value on . & I shall only take it out , on High Days & Holidays . My Son is this Moment come in , & tells me He has rode to Kew ; I am quite vext I did not know where he was to ride , as I could have made him my Meſsenger to have carried you this Letter ; he begs hard to carry it tomorrow , but I think you will receive it sooner by my sending it to London to Day ; upon recollection I shall send it directly to Kew . My poor Mrs : Quin & I are half worn out with having seen Sights -- there is one , which I can not bear to think She should not see , & that is Their Majesty & the Royal Family ; I mean those , who are to be seen in Publick -- now as her State of health makes it impoſsible for her to Dreſs & go to Court , as She could not stand so long ; I am tempted to take her to the Play , whenever their Majesty 's go -- I wish her to see the Queen , who has so highly honoured her Friend , by such gracious Marks of Favour -- & if you could poſsibly let me know when I may have this Opportunity , I shall be vastly obliged to you . pray tell Princeſs Elizabeth I went to Wirgman 's for such a Pencil with a magnifying Glaſs as the other Princeſses had , but he had not one ; I hope soon to get one -- I will send it the first opportunity Adieu my D : Miſs Hamilton believe me Yrs : very Affectly PDartrey I am glad Miſs Goldsworthy is recovered . many thanks for yr : account of our Lisbon Friends .
