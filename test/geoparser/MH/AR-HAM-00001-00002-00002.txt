March April 7 -- I am now ma chere Amie at my estimable friend 's , at Moston near Chester -- Mrs. Mosley has lately presented her husband with a very fine Boy , and I came here to make him personally my Complts . of Congratulation -- Mr. M—— has given me a convincing proof of his friendship for me -- which may be of Servic e to us -- he wishes very much that I wd . contrive to live near him in Staffordshire where he is building an house -- which is only a few miles distant from yr- amiable Relation Lady F. Harpur -- in a cheap & pleasant country -- we shd . be excellent Neighbours -- for we have a very great regard for each other and I must do him the justice to say -- that he poſseses the best Heart and the best principles of any Man I ever met with -- his failings ( of which he has only a moderate share ) are merely foibles -- Vice of every Kind , he is an entire and perfect Stranger to -- and his Virtues have endeared him to me -- he has a good fortune and lives within it -- On th e 3 d I wrote to my dear Mary and on the 5 th- - came here to spend a few days -- The Assizes are now at Chester -- 6 th . We paſsed the greatest part of our time in hearing the trials of the poor Culprits -- one Man was condemned for burglary -- Pepper Arden my Lord Judge -- was so much affected previous to the delivery of the awful Sentence , that I thought he wd . not have been able to have gone thrō . it We dined with a relation of mine -- who lately married a Lady with a fortune of 3000 £ -- and the pretty creature , to shew her taste -- laid out no more than 5000 £ for the furniture of their house -- in the evening we returned to the Castle to hear a curious trial -- in consequence of an Action that was brought against a Man for presuming to give a young Lady a Kiſs -- as to my part , I hardly understand the meaning of the word -- but hope that you will not allways allow me to remain in a State of Ignorance -- This extraordinary trial -- lasted 5 hours -- in the course of it a very beautiful Woman of Character underwent a long Examination to the infinite entertainment of the Court -- I was quite in pain for her -- The poor Man was condemned to pay a fine of 20 Shillings , and probably would pay it with the greatest Reluctan ce and think the favor a very dear purchase -- How superlatively happy shd . I be to steal a Kiſs from my deareſt and most amiable friend and afterwards be condemned to take a 1000 more -- that pleasure I hope will not be long denied to me -- as a little time will give me a right to claim that favor wo n't you say that I am very impertinent or some such sort of thing ? -- Had I been a determined old Batchelor -- the happineſs which my friend enjoys with his amiable Partner would have staggered the firmest resolutions -- I never saw two people more adapted for each other , and consequently are as happy as they can be in this world -- Mr. M—— has been upon many Accounts extremely fortunate -- from his strong partiality to a domestick Life -- which I think he carries too far -- there was great reason to suppose that he would not meet with a woman of his turn of Mind -- particularly when fortune alone was the first Consideration -- in this instance he has been succeſsful , as Mrs. M is every thing he cd . poſsibly wish , and has brought him a fortune of 40,000£ -- and much more is settled upon his Children -- He tells me , that he does not know what will become of him if his Father should die before him -- for an increase of income of 5000 £ a Year wd ruin his happineſs , as he would not know how to make a proper use of so much Money -- his present Income being fully adequate to supply all his Neceſsities , and to procure him all the enjoyments of Life that would be suitable to his Ideas and disposition I have heard of an instance of generosity in the Inhabitants of Chester , which pleased me -- there was lately a dreadful Fever in the town which raged with the greatest violence amongst the poor American Refugees -- A Mr. Skinner who had given up an Estate in America of 3000 £ a Year was attacked , to gether with his wife , and a beautiful and amiable Daughter , with this dire disease -- they were reduced to the last extreme of misery and despair , not having a single morsel of Bread or one poor penny in the world -- their situation being made known to the opulent -- there were none who were blest with tender feelings that did not contribute to the relief of this unhappy family -- a great many Bank Notes were sent to them in blank Covers , and presents were made to them , in such a manner , as could not wound their delicacy -- to the amount of 260 £ in one day -- This unfortunate Man was bereft of his Wife and D—— -- and upon his recovery , being the first time he went to church he gave thanks publickly for the restoration of his Health -- to his Maker -- and expreſsed his Gratitude to his unknown and generous Benefactors in a very handsome Manner . -- -- I do n't know my very dear friend how long I shall remain here -- I believe it will be neceſsary for me to be in Lancashire in a few days -- Mr. M—— has had half an Inclination to treat with me about T—— -- Mos t probably I shall be at home the beginn ing of next week -- You are constantly in my Thoughts -- both Night and Day -- I long to see you again to tell you how much I Love you -- Our next happy Meeting will unite us for Ever and Ever -- Adieu my Love I am always and forever will be Yr .
