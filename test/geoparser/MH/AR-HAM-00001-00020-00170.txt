4 , Suffolk Street Charing Croſs , 10 th . April 1802 . My Dear Sister , I forwarded your enormous Packet to Mrs- De Salis , this forenoon , without reading one single Syllable of it , not poſseſsing any of that Curiosity , for which a certain Sex is so renowned , nor feeling any desire to know more of the Melancholy History of the Duke of Bedford , than I had formerly heard from the Mouth of Dr. Halifax . Your accusation against Me , is , as usual , unjust . I do not keep You in the Dark ; but , am so kept myself . Ld . Pelham , and Mr. Addington received me most graciously , but knew nothing of the Matter . I endeavoured to enlighten their Understandings , and They promised to have an early conversation with the Duke of Portland , who , it was supposed , might comprehend something of the Busineſs , having been Secretary of State for the Home Department . Mr. Dundas is arrived in Town , and told me that he was to have an Interview with Lord Pelham , on Wednesday last , when he hoped to settle my affair , one way or another . This is Saturday Evening , thirty three Minutes past Nine O'Clock exactly , and the only written or verbal Meſsage , I have received , from any of these Great Men , is an Invitation to dine with the Duke of Portland , on Tuesday next , the 13 th - instant , at Six O'Clock . On the 13 th . of April 1784 , at Eight O'Clock in the Morning , I resigned my Liberty , in S t . George 's Church , George Street , Hanover Square . I hope , nothing more calamitous may happen to Me , on the Anniversary of that day , at The Duke of Portland 's . As proof of your consistency , be so good as to read , and compare the enclosed scraps , from your own Letter . You first bid me read Mrs. De Salis 's letter , and then you threaten me if I do read it , before I have put a Wafer , & spit upon it . How You manage at Buzzard Hall , to read sealed up Letters , may be known to Yourself ; but , I confeſs , it is above my capacity . It is not certain , that my Girl will remain behind me . All chance , however , of our Meeting is at an end , as I shall not leave London before the 26 th . , but probably on that day , unleſs I am packed off by Royal Command , in which case , I shall have no time for Visiting . Lady Cecilia has been very civil . Adieu . Give my Love to Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , and my Countrywoman . As for Yourself , I have none to spare to You , but remain ever Your Affecte . Brother Napier Sunday , 11 th - April -- I have opened this letter to tell You , that Mr- Dundas has been with me this forenoon . My business is settled with Ministers , who have agreed to provide Ld . Leven with an Equivalent on the Scotch Establishment . His Majesty 's Ratification is all that is wanted to compleat the matter . That , I trust , will not be refused -- London , Twelfth April 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds .
