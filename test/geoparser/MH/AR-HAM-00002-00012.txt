Anna Maria went to bed at 12 oClock . found a kind letter from the Ducheſs Dr. of Portland at my return home this Eveg . July 17 th . Saturday . At ½ past 6 o'Clock this Morng . I was much surprised & shock 'd by our Housemaid who came & knelt down by my bedside & acknowledged that she had been guilty of stealing some things wch . belong 'd to me & Miſs C 's & yt . she had been a liar -- She gave me a Cambric Handif . of mine of wch : she had pick 'd out ye . Mark . she implored my forgiveneſs and entreated me to save her from losing her character -- the motive of her telling me all this was that Betty our Maid had detected & threatren 'd her wth . acquainting us -- I was so much affected & so pain 'd by finding how much I had been deceived in this Girls character -- that I had only power to tell her I would speak to her on the Subject after I was up . I breakfasted this Morng with A Maria I told her the whole story & what I thought it would be right to do -- she approved , but she could not a t ſ sist me as she was obliged to go out early -- I question 'd Betty , who told me of many things wch . she was certain Hannah had stoln . I call 'd H : & acquainted her that as B : alledged these things against her I should expect she wd . let B : see ye . contents of her Boxes -- it was some satisfaction to me to see that She did not hesitate in complying -- I went wth . them -- charging to prevent B . not to say ing any thing harsh as I wish 'd to reclaim & not to oppreſs her . Betty saw nothing but some old lace edging of mine -- besides wht- H : had before acknowledged to me she had taken . Betty charged her with stealing a Muslin apron wch . ye . other in ye . most solemn manner denied & then bursting into an agony of tears she told me that she relied on my goodneſs for not being more prejudiced against her by what Betty said for that Betty had wrong 'd us as much & more than she had done . as I saw evidently marks of confusion in Betty s countenance & was apprehensive of a violent quarrel between these women , I did not seem to attend to what H : said , but sent B : out of ye . Room to get my things ready for dreſsing -- I then made H—— acquaint me what she meant by accusing B—— in that indirect manner -- She opened such a scene e of fraud -- falseneſs & c & c that my astonishment was great indeed -- I had the most perfect confidence in B—— & thought her a perfectly honest & good young Woman I had imagined her principles were excellent & also thought that she had a great Affection for Anna Maria and me , we both thought so , & treated her accordingly . Anna Maria came home at 11 -- I inform 'd her of what I had heard -- we ask 'd Betty if she could vindicate herself & were both of us shock 'd to find she could not -- As I thought it was best to take ye mildest method & endeavour if poſsible to work upon the minds of these Women & try first to rec t l aim them by gentle means -- I told A Maria that as it would be utterly impossible for us to give them a character we would not turn them away but by a generous forgiveneſs & good advice try to effect a reformation in their minds & excite their gratitude . A Maria 's thoughts on this subject were the same with mine -- we call 'd them & told them that we would not turn them away & c & c , & that they might not reproach one to another . I insisted upon their mutually forgiving and made them promise they would keep this affair a secret from their acquaintances -- After they had made this promise & I had seen them embrace each other with real signs of forgiveneſs I gave them some advice -- they seem 'd penitent & so ended this disagreeable affair . -- Mr : Dewes sent me a very kind & friendly note wch .

Was much surprised to see Miſs Burney paſs by -- as he went to Brighthelmstone but 3 or 4 days ago . his Horses & Grooms were at Miſs Palmer s door for two hours -- by this the Prince of Wales I suppose is return 'd & c & c & c & cc Mrs. Armstead 's Carriage came for me ½ past 4 o'Clock -- she was quite well Mr. Fox & her Brother Lady Stormont din 'd with us -- they staid with us till after 8 o'Clock -- Lord Stormont told me that ye . french is were certainly taking infinite pains to ad d o pt our Manners & learn our language -- that it was astonishing what a rapid progreſs they made in both . he entertained me very much by describing the different stiles of of manners in foreign Countries & particularly the bon ton etiquette in France .

July 1784 -- at 9 went down to A M -- Breakfasted tête á tête -- she read me some paſsages she had selected from Lady S—— s pleasures of ye . imagination , what genius & imagination fancy & how many fine images of Providence & Nature there are in this beautiful Poem though I must confeſs that there are parts of it which are to me obscure -- but that is more likely to be a defect owing owing to my want of comprehension . These are among my favorite lines -- “ There let thy Soul acknowledge its- complaint How blind , how impious ! there behold ye- ways Of Heav'n 's eternal destiny to Man For ever just , benevolent , & wise , That Virtue 's awful steps , howe'er pursu e 'd By vexing fortune & intrusive pain , Should never be divided from her chaste , Her fair attendant pleasure , need I urge Thy tardy thought thro ' all ye . various round Of this existence , that thy soft'ning soul At length may learn what energy ye hand Of Virtue mingles in ye bitter tide Of Paſsion swelling wth . distreſs & pain , To mitigate ye . sharp with gracious drops Of cordial pleasure ? “ Ask ye faithful Youth “ Why ye . cold Urn of her whom long he lov 'd “ So often fills his arms , so often draws “ His lonely footsteps at ye . silent hour “ To pay ye . mournful tribute of his tears ? O ! he “ O ! he will tell thee ; that y e wealth of worlds “ Should ne'er seduce his bosom to forego “ That sacred hour , when , stealing from the noise “ Of care & envy , sweet remembrance sooths “ With Virtue 's kindest looks his aking breast , “ And turns his tears to rapture. ” -- Mark Akenside , The Pleasures of the Imagination , 3 vols .

I know how to pity her , for the greatest part of my life I have suffer 'd exquisitely from allowing my sensibility to get the better of my reason -- I trust I am now a more reasonable being . & as I think I am sensible of all my faults & weakneſs 's I hope to conquer them & by that means not only insure my own happineſs -- but contribute to the happineſs of my D—— & preserve his love , his confidence , & esteem .
