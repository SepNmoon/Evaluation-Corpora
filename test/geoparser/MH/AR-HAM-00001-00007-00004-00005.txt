Friday morn 6 th July 1781 Notwithstanding I feel myself under your displeasure I can not help enquiring after your health . And is it poſsible then , my dear Miſs Hamilton that a slight omiſsion , & that apologizd for , shoud be punish 'd by the Forfeiture of yr Friendship ? When Prince Edward returnd from W . he informd me you had been very ill . I wishd to make many enquiries which I knew coud not be answerd -- I hoped to see you on Wednesday here . In this also I was disappointed . If therefore I am no longer what I was , write to Fisher , he has not offended you , & give him an account of yr Health . Ever yrs J. F .
