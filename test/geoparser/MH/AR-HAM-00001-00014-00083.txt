Be aſsured my Dear Miſs Hamilton , that you are very much mistaken if you think that I ever imagined you had acted from a wrong motive , far otherwise , for in regard to the unfortunate person who has ocaſsioned you so much uneasineſs I am convinced it is from an over feeling Heart , & which will my Dear in this deceitful World ocaſsion you too much misery . I was hurt in regard to myself for be aſsured you could not more immediately feel an attachment than I did for you , & be aſsured , be convinced , that I Ever have , that I Ever shall endeavor to convince you that my proffeſsions of Friendship are sincere , & that I will prove them such , I wish you would as soon make yourself easy , as I shall forget the little mesentendú we had , I will certainly walk with the Children , & if you had rather not attend them in to the Queens Apartment I will with great pleasure , for I have nothing to do , & will say you are not well if you are low take my advice & do not attempt it Believe me my Dear most truly Affly Yr MC Goldsworthy
