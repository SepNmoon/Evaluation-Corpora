29 March 1793 That a man should write in such good spirits in the absence of his Wife would surprize me , did I not know how to account for things -- your letter entertained me greatly , and for a Taxal man you surprize me how you could spin out such a variety of matter -- as to the odious odious tract I am not in the least surprized , sameneſs will tire , and of all men in the World I am the last to wish to purr away life in the chimney corner -- society is the zest of life , we are but vegetables without it , but avast if you please , the inceſsant changes , and the mere profeſſional friendships which engage the time of fashio na ble folk is to me far more tiresome than even the repeated strol in the same path by the same river , with the same Woman -- my idea of the marriage state is this -- he is happyest that has the smallest ground for regret , for as to being always in love , 't is something like being always hungry which is impoſſible -- now says H. Hamilton filthy fellow , does he call that love ? softly my dear Madam , do you remember S t Peter and the sheet ? besides think of little Mrs : D . -- but to return , tho I know there are some people who are not always tired of each other , I know there are thousands who regard a Wife in the same Sense as they do a cane , a cork : skrew a snufbox , only because they have had it so long -- Darby & Joan had no other reason -- You have described a paragon of a Woman , worth 20 golden fleeces -- did not you wrong Louisa in your heart , that you did -- as to me I am old gentleman , but I had rather smooth his road to Heaven , than be in poſseſsion of all his Herculanium crockery -- I think with such a one , a tolerable good purr might be made out , but I should hate myself for being so much the older tabby of the Two -- it wd not do in the end -- I could cure Sir Wm . damn that fellow Mrs : D—— with his gout in the Nerves are not we all nerves -- let Turton take a bit of Knighton Ginger bread for break fast with a glaſs of sack or old Madeira -- be in the open air in dry weather , or use a Swing within doors in damp Weather , dine at her hungry hour , use brisk exercise in a ca r riage , sup early , drink draught Porter banish tea , rise early , my life against Mrs : D . s she will grow a stout woman . for my part I had much rather have a beef Steak Wife than a water gruel one . If she walks and is an hungred , let her snap two or three oysters & a morsel of bread -- if milk agrees with her let her take it at night . in the morning it disposes to sleep , whereof exercise is the life of the machine -- Delicacy of the Sex ! fiddlesticks , how they dance , rake , and have children -- delicate with all my heart ! A certain Turton in the Imperial service was asked by Lord Taafe how he was enabled to make so gallant a defence at a certain post with so few men . plase your Majesty , I took the Soldiers wifes , and clapp 'd ridgementals on 'em , and I gived a whirelock to ivery one of the bitches , and by Jas Jesus , plase your Majesty the bitches kipt up sich a whireing , that we kipt the innemy off till we got a reinforcement . delicacy -- I am not an enemy to milk chocolate , depend on it Women are ruined by slops & medicine , make them hungry by air and exercise , let them live generously , then no pimples , then no vapors , no yawnings , no halfsleeps -- put it to Geo : 2d , if he does not aſſent , ( he may be a clever fellow ) he is no physician for me or my Wife . Turton does not know so much of the gout as I , I flatter myself -- I am just arisen from my bed having had him in both feet , both ancles , both k n ees , both elbows , and my left crupper -- very well -- having found it imprudent to brave him , I yielded to flannel , to slops , sweating , low diet while the Fever with delirium lasted -- I found ( this is the second time of trial ) great relief from rubbing the painful part with Opodeldoc , which never repelled the nor have I this bout , had the least complaint in head or Stomach on former occasions I plyed my gentleman in head or Stomach with Tinc . Rhab . ȝ . S . I am now relieved from pain , walk pretty hobbling , write as you see a pretty legible hand like yours , eat what pleases me , and drink a pint of Madeira & a fig for the Doctor -- I have been my own Esculapius -- Nervous gout indeed -- a novel term well done Master Turton -- 4 Weeks have been the total of my confinement , & I have had the gout since 1769 -- what say you , Dr. Turton ? I am within 3 years of 60 -- what say you Master Turton de tirte a fuera of cursed Anguera -- si quid novisti rectius I beg youll tell me . We are all for War here , as you may gueſs by my date ( March 29 th . 1793 ) -- I dont know if it will not be of service to me , as I must cripple about more or leſs -- I am a happy mortal on the whole , tho there be so many people in your England and my Ireland whom I long to see aye and embrace s in ner that I am . I am equally surprized & grieved that my dear niece Mr Doctor Turton is not made acquainted with the mysteries , because tho ' I dont suppose she would ride astride to Gretna Green , yet I think she wd . like to yield to the soft impulse , if a gentle legal force was used -- She will make a good choice ( if I may judge for a Woman ) but I wish she wou l d make her election sure -- I have no notion of such fruit hanging Summer after Summer -- give my love to your Wife , I dont altogether deserve the favorable opinion she entertains of me , but I deserve certainly about 19 / 20 ths -- she will write to me & so will you , I shant die yet .
