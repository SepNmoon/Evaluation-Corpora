Tewin Water 14 th - Novr . 1782 . I have this moment received my Dear Sister s Letter , the contents of which have not in the least surprised me . Whatever your motives may have been , I dare say they were prudent ones . The Salary of your Place was by no means a recompence for the Confinement & neceſsary Expences , and indeed the only inducement I can discover for your remaining in that situation was the Gracious attention of your Royal Mistreſs . I hope Her Majesty is quite satisfied with your reasons for resigning . Adieu . I am just come in from riding with my fingers so cold that I can hardly hold my Pen . I expect soon to be in Town , but should wish to know when you leave Windsor . Now that you will have more leisure , write to me often -- and beleive your removal from the Ear of a Queen will not make any alteration in the Esteem I have ever profeſsed for You . I remain ever My Dear Sister , your sincere friend and Affectionate Brother N—— The Old Lady sends her best Compts- to You -- says she is convinced You would not have left Court , unleſs you was going to be married .
