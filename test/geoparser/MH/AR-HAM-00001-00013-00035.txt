May 1786 I will make no rash v ow , nor fly into a paſsion , but send for a frank to thank my dear Mr Mr .. Dickenson for his kind & Affectionate letter , I have seldom met with a true friend , but I now have in you & will pay the greatest attention to all your Criticism , dont imagine that I think you a severe critic for I really do not , I well know I merit the rebuke you sent me . I am very angry with my dear Anna Maria , for had she been as attentive to me as you have been , I should before this have been better able to have kept up a correspondence with you , I will no t be afraid , but write to you as usual begging that you will correct me as you find occasion , which I fear will be too often the case , but you may depend upon it I will be more attentive to my manner of writing . I must write a few lines to dear Mrs. D .. therefore will only give my mother s love to you & Mrs. Lenton 's best compts . & believe me more than ever your obliged Friend Mary Glover My Mother was as much pleased as I was with your letter & thanks you .
