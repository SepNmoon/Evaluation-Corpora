Saturday -- I took my letter to Bampton & called on Mr. Dayvy where we took some pains to adjust the picture -- he walked wh- me to the Limestone Quarry at the end of the town but as Morrison would have it there were no foſsils there , but a fine Lime Stone almost black -- When I returned to Oakford found a person has been there full of the great News that put us all in high Spirits -- Sunday -- We all tried to prevail on Mr. Paynter to receive the Sacrament with us this morng -- but nothing can make him talk seriously -- It was the first time James administered it & his Mother was much affected -- After dinner a Meſsenger was sent to Bampton to see if there was a Letter for me & to bring News papers from Mr. Badcock -- which damped our Spirits again tho the Reports from the Allies are very encouraging -- Monday -- Owing to Mr. Paynter s dilatorineſs we did not set off till eleven this morng -- James accompanied us to Bampton & is to set out to meet his Cousin at Oakhampton tomorrow & attend him to Cornwal as he is not fit to go so far alone -- Mrs P . seemed much affected at parting with us -- & I felt much obliged by her Civilities & those of every one else -- I set Mrs. P . down at Tiverton & as there was no Conveyance by Coach before tomorrow morning , I ordered another Post Chaise & came to Exeter -- brought Parkin 's & Paynter s trunks wh- me as they would have been distreſsed by a mis calculation of a Conveyance from thence -- I had a very fine drive to Exeter -- Sir T. Ackland paſsed me in his Curricle -- his Servt . drove & he was makg Notes to speechify at Exeter I suppose -- I had some Conversation wh- the Boy that drove me up the long hill -- he said the Road from Tiverton to South Molton is rough & stoney , up hill & down -- 19 miles & 18 hills & all Gentn . grumble at being obliged to be 4½ hours in going so short a distance -- I have now paſsed 3 times thro this beautiful Country & am become pretty well acquaint ed with it -- I find the new Mayor is chosen today & the old gives an Entertainment -- As soon as I came here I took another peep at Exeter Mr. P told me to day that the County rates in Devon are enormous -- there are 500 L County Bridges & the expence of their Repairs & ye- prosecution of felons is never leſs than 36-000 L & frequently exceeds 40-000 L -- he said there is a bridge which divides the Counties of Devon & Cornwal that fell down , I dont know how long since & for want of funds has been allowed to remain in that state -- part of it belongs to ye- Deanery of Exeter & there was an idea of selling the Trees that ornament that beautiful Walk called Northeny that constitutes a principal feature in this place toward 's defraying the expence of the Church 's Share of this bridge -- fortunately this horrible Act of Barbarism is given up -- Immediately on my arrival here I went to the Mail Coach Office -- but could not get a place at present know not the hour when I can get away -- The W ea ther is so fine that I am anxious to get to Plymouth & I understand there is only one day allowed to see Mount Edgecumbe & that day is at present unknown to me -- formerly Wed—— & Fridays were given up to the public -- I shall go sometime & till then will amuse myself by thinking of you -- Miſs Parkin has more sense than all her family put together -- her manners are not fine & she holds herself ill , but She appears to me to be a very amiable Woman -- She has had a great many good Offers , but rejected them all -- I dont at all like her friend Mr. H . -- he is an artful longheaded -- dirty Scotchman -- who has coaxed her from interested Motives & it is natural for a young Woman much secluded from Society , to form a warm Attachment to those who have contributed to make her happy -- I am now to be off in two hours but as I am to go all night will not send this from hence as it will be pleasanter to you to know that I am arrived at Plymouth -- where I expect to have the pleasure of finding a letter from You -- The Beugles have just been playing delightfully before my Window Plymouth -- Fountain Inn Tuesday -- Last night I took Coach at ten OClock & arrived at this place at 7 -- the road is the most hilly I ever travelled The first 9 miles required full 2 hours -- the Mail is allowed that time -- at 5 it began to rain & has never ceased -- I slept frequently on the way , so that on my arrival here instead of going to bed I dreſsed & made myself comfortable by 8 OClock & then sat down to breakfast -- The Post Office is not open till ten -- Patience ! -- I have seen Mount Edgecumbe & Ld Borringdon s from the Coach & can see Mt . E . any day by applying to the Housekeeper , so I 'm easy on that score -- The Land in the Dock belonged to Sir John St. Aubin -- The Crown paid him a Sum of Money & a Quit Rent of 200 L pr . An . -- All the Land at Dock on wch . Houses are built on leases belongs to him & he is supposed to derive an income from this property of 20-000 pr . An . his Mines in Cornwal 10000 more & yet he is poor -- he has a number of natural Children who are very extravagant I have been to the Post Office -- no letter -- if you wrote on Saturday as I requested it must be here -- The Mail to day is not arrived -- that can only bring a letter by mistake It is too soon to call on the Commiſsioner -- I will try to find out Mrs. Rundell s Retreat -- I have at last found Mrs. Rundell and a retreat it is -- ½ past one -- I am now 5 Miles from Dock -- I went to Plymouth thinking it poſsible that you might have docked yr- direction & I shd . find it at the Post Office there -- however there I learnt tidings of this Seclusion & hired a Man to walk with me part of the Way & here I am & just concluding my letter to send it in time for the Post -- Dont write again as I feel no inclination to prolong my Stay -- No words can describe the Beauties I have seen this day -- Adieu -- Mrs. R . is looking vastly well I see no difference except what the loſs of Teeth creates -- Most Affy Yr JD .
