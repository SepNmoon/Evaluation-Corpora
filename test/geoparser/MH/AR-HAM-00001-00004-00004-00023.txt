Naples Augt . 2 d . 1785 I received your Letter My Dear Niece a few days ago on my return from a Tour of the Islands of Ischia , Ventotiene , Ponza , Palmarole Zanone & c all Volcanick , and Ponza is so curious as to furnish matter for a letter to the R . Society when I can lay aside the idleneſs which is apt to fasten upon me in this bewitching Climate Otiosa Napoli has ever been its Epithet & so I find it -- I sincerely congratulate you on your Marriage I have such an opinion of your judgements that I am convinced of Mr. Dickenson s merit tho ' I have not not the pleasure of knowing him pray tell him from the moment hi of His marriage I am become his humble Servant & shall be happy when an opportunity shall offer of making his acquaintance -- He is a lucky Man for I do swear of all the Women on Earth I do not know one that in my opinion woud make so good a wife as yourself , I believe if I had not been your Uncle I shoud have been apt to have proposed to you myself ; and then I am little too old . You joke about Ly . C I do aſsure you that I did not mean to propose to her when she thought I did & answerd that she had determined never to change her State . But I will be fair enough to say that she seemd to me to have many domestick qualities & her taste for musick was so perfect & my present Situation so desolate that if she had been willing I might have done what I suppose the world wou 'd call a folly -- however I believe it is best as it is . W hen the Court is here , I live with their Sicilian Majesties but now They are absent I paſs my time rather dully -- for what is a home without a bosom friend & Companion ? My Books , pictures -- musick , prospect are certainly something , but the Soul to all is wanting . Adieu my Dear Mrs. Dickinson Your most affecly . Wm . Hamilton via Mantua To Mrs. Dickenson at Miſs Clarke s No 27 Clarges Street Chesterfield Taxal Daschau Daeskeu
