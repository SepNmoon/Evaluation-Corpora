A good part typed Taxal Janry : 11 th : 1775 It gave me great Pleasure to receive a Letter from Dr : Miſs Hamilton after so long a Silence , especiall y as I found it was owing to the Miscarriage of a Letter which I had not recd . & , not to your having forgot me . had this been the case I coud not in reality have blamed you . as I was conscious to my self of being a very improper Correspondent for a young Lady , of your Age . & : but your obliging partiality to me when at Northn : made me vain enough to hope you wou 'd not totally forget me . & I find I was not mistaken . I paſs 'd the last Spring & most of the Summer , in a very uncomforable State of Health . & was so bad for some time that I had little hopes of surviving it . & poor Sally was in a most dangerous Situation , from with the Measles . Thank God we are both got pretty well , & I have born the Winter hitherto . beyond my Expectations . I was a Month this Summer at Buxton . & think I found great benefit . my Chief Complaint was Rhuematism , but it brought me so very weak , so low , & so thin that I think I coud almost ve n ture to Northampton without being known by you . Is Mrs. Hamilton ever troubled with the Rhuematism ? if she is , Buxton is the only place in the World for her there is often a great deal of good Company , & when the Weather is good you may spend a few Weeks there , very agreeably , & Matlock ( which most People go to after bathing at Buxton ) is a sweet pretty romantic Place . this ( with the Wonders of the Peak ) wou 'd entertain you for a Summers Excursion . I might then hope to see you once more , tho ' I am not without the Intention at least of some time or other visiting Northampton , again , but it will not I think be soon . I expect Mr Lawton to return my Visit in the Summer , or I shall be very angry . I recd : a Letter from that Gent yesterday , & shoud take it as a favour if you woud let him know I did receive it , & intend to write to him soon . & now my dear young Friend give me leave to enquire how you have spent your time since I had the pleasure of seeing you ? for I know you coud not be Idle ? have you pursued your Latin ? or what is your chief Employment ? I hear you have learnt to draw , & I long to see some of your performances in this way . as I know you had a natural Genious for it . Sally begs you will indulge her with something of your doing , if it be but the size of a crown piece . she desires her most affect : regards to you & Mrs : Hamilton , she still remembers with gratitude the great Civilities she receiv 'd from you . your old Friend Jack is now at home for th e days & desires his Compts . he is very happily fix 'd with a worthy Clergiman near Derby , a Man of great Sen s e & Learning , who only takes 4 boarders ; & whose behaviour is so agreeable to Jack that he pursues his Studies with the greatest pleasure , he is at present as good as we coud wish him I really find my self incapable of drawing a Character which woud do any sort of justice to the Friend I have lost . she was a most deserving Woman , & the only thing I can do towards the performance of my promise is to send you a few of her Letters , wch : will give you some Idea of the Beauties of her Mind her Person ( when young ) was very handsome , but that was her least Perfection . my Eyes are grown extreamly weak , so that out of Charity you must give me two or 3 letters for one . which is the only footing on which I dare venture to correspond , & this wou 'd be too great a favour to expect from you , as I have nothing to pay you in return but the sincere regard of Your Affect & obliged S Dickenson Mr D joynes with us all in wishing you the Compts : of the Season .
