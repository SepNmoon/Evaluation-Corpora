My Dear Miſs Hamilton It was impoſsible for me to answer your Note when I recd . it at my return to the Queen 's Houſe , from whence I am just come . We all both there & here unite in being truly concern 'd for your Disorder & hope you will take all imaginable care of yrself . I do not call , as you know the Sound of a Sore Throat ( thō I hope yrs . is no alarming Sort ) does not allow of it as I go to the Princes . If any thing I can do here could be useful to you pray let me know it , & particularly with regard to Deal . Adieu my dear I sincerely hope a little proper Care will restore you to perfect health Yrs . most Sincerely & Affly C.Finch St James 's Wednesday ½ past 3 . Miſs Hamilton
