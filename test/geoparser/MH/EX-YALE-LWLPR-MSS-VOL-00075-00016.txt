St James 's Place Wednesdy 11 th My Dear Miſs Hamilton as I have the truest opinion of your goodneſs to me , and of of the uprightneſs of your judgement ; I venture to submit this flower to your sentence ; whether it is to receive the highest of honours , or be condemn 'd to the station it has a better claim to ? aſsured you will not permit me to take an improper liberty , where , so much distance & respect are due ; and where you know I feel that mixture of awe and admiration , which can only be felt , but not expreſ 'd . The Dſs Dowr : of Portland came on Sunday evening just after you went away , always sorry to miſs you . I hope th e at kind , tho short , Visit , did you as much good , as it did your most affectionate and much obliged Mary Delany
