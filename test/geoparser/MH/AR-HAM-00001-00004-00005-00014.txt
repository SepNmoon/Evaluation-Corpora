Octr . 23 d -- 1779 -- It was so long since I had heard from you My Dear Miſs Hamilton that I was upon the point of writing to chide you for not answering a letter I wrote to you a long time ago when the last post brought me yours of the 25 th . of Septr wherein you seem surprised at my silence when you were actually a letter in my debt ; however I should not have stood upon that ceremony with one I love so well as I do you if my natural indolence had not totally got the better of me , I am ashamed to say what ground it has gain 'd with me & when I endeavour to combat it , it is so eloquent & plausible that there is no resisting , this added to the very little share of time I can call my own has kept me silent , but I beg you will not follow my bad example , letters from the friends we love are always valuable ; but particularly in this Country and at this distance , so I beg you to let me hear from you a little oftener . I find you have had an account of the terrible eruption of Mount Vesuvius which happen 'd on the 8 th . of Augst . & I suppose have seen the little drawing which Sr Wm . sent for His Majesty which I do aſsure you is not in the least exaggerated . it was really horrid & the confusion it occasion 'd ( I was going to say ) more horrid , the Yells & screams of the people , going in Proceſsion with torches to S t Genaro made one shudder , & it was evident that terror having had the same effect as drunkeneſs , had rais 'd their minds to a pitch of Madneſs capable of the most violent undertakings , in consequence of which they went to the Archbishop s Palace & insisted upon having S t Genaro brought out , & upon his refusal to comply they sett fire to his Gate & were now succeeding in forcing the Saint out ( wch . must have then been attended with bad consequences ) when some one very happily thought of applying to a Dominican Friar called Padre Rocca who is a very popular Preacher ( owing to his adapting his Sermons to the understandings , education , & language of the people , ) he came immediately , & upon perceiving they had prepared common pitch torches to accompany their Saint , he reproach 'd them with their want of respect in coming so ill furnish 'd , & persuaded them to retire till they could procure white wax torches which might be done ( as he said ) the next day -- to this they listen 'd , & time being gain 'd the fever of the Mountain subsided , & the minds of the people of course became more calm , it had afterwards another fit , but they were then grown used to it , & as it happen 'd in the day time it did not inspire them with so much terror -- since this the mouth has been stopp 'd up , till two or three days ago a part of the point fell in , & it now smokes very much -- this morning it gave two groans which I do not quite like particularly as we are at present at our Villa at the foot of Vesuvius , but Sr Wm . ( the Mountain Doctor ) aſsures me we have nothing to fear ; since the eruption we have had a shock of an earthquake but it has done no damage ; this however makes me think many months will not paſs without another eruption , but I hope it will be leſs violent than the last , & I trust in that Almighty Providence which has hitherto preserv 'd us in numberleſs occasions that it will continue to do so , & under that persuasion I rest as quietly here as I should elsewhere . The little Court of last Year is at present at Caserta where we are to join it the beginning of next Month for the Space of one Month , when they go to Parsano a Hunting Seat about fifty Miles off & I am afraid Sr Wm . with them as The King has appointed him a room in all his hunting Seats this is very uncomfortable to me , as I really feel quite abandon 'd when I am in Naples without him -- the footing Sr Wm . is upon at this Court is really a very odd one , he seems to be the Ministre de Famille while the French Ambaſsador ( who has managed his Affairs exceedingly ill ) is treated ( tho ' with civility ) with great distance -- I hear he is soon to leave this place which I am sorry for , unleſs it was to be first Minister in France ; & I wish all the French King s Ministers were like him -- the change in the Queen s character is amazing since the Death of the Prince Royal , it has made an impreſsion upon her that I thought her incapable of , hardly a day paſses that she does not shed floods of tears , & the only happy hours she seems to paſs is when she is employ 'd in the care of her Daughters , three of whom are most charming Children The poor little Prince Royal is no comfort to her , on the contrary , her Ambitions ( wch . I believe to be a predominant paſsion ) & Vanity , are perpetually mortified thro ' him for he is a poor little weakly unpromising Child , wth . a large head & a rickety look & the Queen is at times so hurt about him that she can not help lamenting his great backwardneſs in too Strong terms . Her Majesty now gives a great deal of time to busineſs of works with The Ministers , who make all their reports to her as well as to The King , who seems ( in general ) very glad she will take the burthen off his Shoulders , I am told that she is grown ( in private ) very devout ( not to say superstitious ) for she lately sent in Secret a Nightgown of The King s when he was sick to a famous relick to touch it , to help his recovery & I am much mistaken ( as Years come on ) if she does not grow in that respect like The Empreſs Queen -- I thought these circumstances might amuse you My Dear Miſs Hamilton , but you may imagine I should not have ventured to write them if I had not an opportunity of sending my letter to be put into the Post at Rome where it is sure of not being look 'd into . -- both Sr Wm . & I have been quite delighted with the accts . of H . R . H . Prince William -- there is a story in the Newspaper of his taking off his coat & preparing for the engagement wch . is charming , what a difference between him & the D. de Chartres whose conduct will never be applauded otherwise qu ' a l'Opera , I suppose you saw the Song upon that Glorious occasion . can not finish my letter without rejoicing with you afresh upon the happineſs of yr situation , & or the constant goodness of Their Majesties to you , & at your combined
