Kinsale , 25 th . Novr . 1786 . Had you been my Wife , my Dear Sister , I certainly would have applied for a Divorce . Pray has not your husband an undoubted right to tumble down Stairs whenever he pleases , without your presuming to be alarmed ? I see Mr. Dickenson is a Jerry . When my Wife was with Child of Mary , we were stopped in the Streets of Dublin by Six footpads . I was obliged to draw my Sword when She was in the Carriage & we got away without being robbed , but She durst as soon have eat my Sword as played me such a Trick , as You did Mr. D—— . I must give him some proper Advice , relative to the true mode of managing Wives -- I shall however be glad to hear You have made up for disappointing him , be the production Male or Female . I think the only way You can effectively do so , will be by presenting him with Twins . There is no sight by which I should be so much gratified , as to see You dancing your Child . I dare say You will look at it as my Wife did viz . As if she had no right to have one . Now , she begins to know how to touch them , as if they were not made of Glaſs . As for me , I keep the whole Nursery in proper Awe & subjection . I approve of your going to Northampton for a multitude of good reasons . The Cathcart 's can aſsist in Nursing You & the Air of Dallington may be of service afterwards . You do not tell me whether you propose nursing yourself or not . Ld . C—— is I find a Candidate to succeed one of the two Scotch Peers who have been called up to the House of Lords by new Titles , & he wrote me word he intended going to Scotland to canvaſs in person . I fear he has no chance of Succeſs & with all due deference to his Lordship 's wisdom , I think his Journey be no means prudent . He & his family seem to exist more in Post Chaises , than in comfortable houses . I am very sorry to hear such unfavourable accounts of Charles Cathcart 's health . I ever considered him as the most amiable of that set of my Cousins . I suspect he has not saved as much as he might have done in the East with credit , as an Officer of Rank who is lately come home told Me that Charles wasted all his time in Journey 's between or rather Voyages between the two Country 's . His constitution has been bad from his Infancy , & I recollect before he first went to India , he was tormented with a spitting of Blood . I suppose the Graham 's are now at Dallington . Your Uncle Frederick has I suppose imagine taken a new lease of his Life . I think the Bedford Square House might have contented him , but poſsibly it may not be his disposition to be contented . Mr. Pechell returned some time ago from his Royal Visit , has since that been appointed one of Her Majesty 's Ushers & obtained excellent Rooms in Hampton Court . Mrs- Pechell has not been in the straw lately , but I suspect bids fair to be there next Summer . Sir John & Lady Warren are gone to paſs the Winter in France . They have taken their Son with them & left their daughter with Lady Clavering , who has removed her abode to Clar ges Street Lady Warren tried some experiment of rearing a Girl she produced a few months ago with spoon meat only , which ended in the Infant 's departure from this World . My wife & brats are well . My boy is called William John after his two Grandfathers . We propose innoculating him in a fortnight or three Weeks . An operation I would allways recommend to have done when the Child is about two Months old & which is absolutely neceſsary for children , who like ours , are liable to be moved at a moments warning . Pray do you know a place of the name of Mansell Park in your Neighbourhood ? I saw it advertised for Sale & was half inclined to enquire about the price of it . As the Advertisement is discontinued , I suppose the place is disposed of . Maria joins me in every poſsible wish for your Safety , welfare & happineſs . Mr. Dickenson tho ' personally unknown to Us , has his full share of our Affections ; his having chosen You to torment him is a convincing proof to Us that we must love him . Ever your faithfull friend & affectionate Brother N—— JD desires Love & kindest respects Beech Sat . going to return home alone Mrs. Dickenson KINSALE Taxal Chapel le Frith By Derbyshire . 6½ 41- 10-10 51-10 7 18 59-8-6½
