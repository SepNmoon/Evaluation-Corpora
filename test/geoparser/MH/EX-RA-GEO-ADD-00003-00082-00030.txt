I can hardly find words sufficiently strong , in which I can paint my gratitude to my dearest dearest dearest Friend for having been so generously pardon 'd as I was . I believe you will find all these reports as many calumnies spread about by that noxious little Animal and that foolish , vulgar meddling Woman . I laid myself perfectly open to you when I wrote my last Letter , and acted with that ingenuousneſs , ( which I shall do ev er do to you , and which I flattered myself I always had done , I denied what was false , but if I ſhld .. find tho ' I am not conscious of it that any of them ſhld .. be true I will immediately acknowledge my guilt , and throw myſelf upon yr . mercy . What I felt when I last saw you , to speak to you can not be imagined , I was stung to the Soul , at ye . cold style in which yr . Letter was written and at ye . idea of having lost a friend , and such a friend too , a friend to whom I cld .. lay open ye most secret thoughts of my mind mind was too much for me , I cld .. not indure it , I was also very much nettled wt ye . idea of having told you an broke my Word untruth & honor & to w hich I had engaged to you in ye most solemn manner that could be & which I was certain was an utter falsety , such were ye . different Paſsions that raged in my bosom when I saw you . I cld .. not be content nor rest in peace , till I had cleared my innocence to you from every imputation of whatever sort or kind , & until I had regained that good opinion which it ever has been , ever was my object was and which ever shall be my object to attain & nay that I am sure I have gained it to keep Yr . last Letter restored that comfort to my too much wounded heart , to which it had been a stranger from ye . time I received yr . former it restored comfort to my whole frame , & after I had read yr . Letter I was quite a different Being than I was when I began it . I conjure you my angelick friend never to put me to so severe a trial again it is too much for me , tell me another time if there are any more of these villainous calumnies circulated about , tax me with them , but do not say you believe them till I have at l ea st attempted to justify myſelf . How can I bear ſupport ye . thoughts of ever breaking off my friendship with you , I can not , can not support it , I ever will remain yr . Friend , my attachment , for you my affection & my love for you extend w b eyond what ye ideas of Man can convey , ye . trial was almost too severe for me which I ſuffered from yr . former L—— for so short a time but which appeared ages to me judge then how much more bitter ye . Potion wld .. be if it was for life . Let me once more expreſs my thanks for having been so generously pardoned by you , and let me once more say that I believe you will find all those reports so many untruths , to what purpose created I really can not say imagine , unleſs it be to do mischief , which is ye . only reason I fancy can be given for such abominable illnature . My attachment , affection , & love for you are so firm that nothing upon earth shall ever alienate them , aſsure me that yr . sentiments correspond with mine , & believe me to be My ever-adored Friend , toujours de même Votre Palemon . P.S . Excuse ye frequent Blottings out in this L—— for I am greatly very much hurried , & I have one favor to ask of you & that is that you will receive me ye . next time we meet , with a more benign , affectionate & f r iendly aspect , do not trifle with my feelings any more than I will with yrs . . Je vous repéte encore toutes les douceurs poſsibles . et croyez que je serai jusqu ' à la mort Vôtre tres sincerement attaché Ami consider and me tell me you do in yr . next . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu
