Cork 21 st . July 1785 . My Dear Sister , I need not tell You how happy I was to receive your Letter giving me an account of your Marriage . I beg you will present my best Compliments to Mr. Dickenson & tell him that I very sincerely wish he may be as miserable & unhappy in his new Situation as I am . You must be surprised at not having heard from me sooner , but I did not receive your Letter 'till last Night owing to my having been absent from home for some Weeks , looking after a Legacy I lately succeeded to by the Death of a distant relation of mine ( a Mrs- Naper ) in this Country who has left me an Executor & Residuary Legatee , by which I shall pocket about Three Thousand Guineas . Some of her relations have however attacked the Will , but without any good ground to go on . The busineſs will be brought before the Prerogative Court next November , in the mean time I have administered , paid the Legacies & c. & c. If I carry my cause I shall directly point at a Company in the Guards , so that You and all my friends must pray fervently for my Succeſs , if You have any desire of seeing me in Britain . Maria grows large & is to be confined next Month . When that event happens I shall not fail to communicate it to You . She begs to join me in every good wish for the happineſs & satisfaction of Yourself & Mr. Dickenson . Beleive me ever your very sincere friend & affectie . Brother Napier .
