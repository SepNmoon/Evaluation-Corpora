Naples Novr . 5 th . 1782 . A thousand thanks My Dear Niece for your very affectionate letter I know that your tender heart wou 'd sensibly feel for me in my present distreſs , you have indeed loſt a valuable friend but it is not in the power of Words to expreſs what I have lost . In spite of all my philosophy and that I know that all regrets are vain I can not help indulging myself in them every moment -- a Chair a table a Pianoforte Alas ! every little circumstance recalls to my mind the happy moments that are gone gone for ever , I have nothing for it but to drive away thought as much as I can and indeed H . S . Majesty is so good as to aſsist me greatly in that respect , for He takes me out a shooting every day & says he will do so as long as the Shooting Season continues , to day above 70 Wild Boars have fall'n & when we have nothing better to do we shoot larks -- I often think of a farce in which one is described as such a perfect Nimrod , that he hunted every thing , from the flea in the blanket to the Elephant in the forrest ; which is pretty near our Case Case ; The air and exercise keeps up my health and Spirits which woud infallibly suffer was I to stay much at home which is no longer comfortable to me -- Archie is also very kind to me & often sends for me to paſs the Evening with Her and the Princeſs Royal -- The present Diſsipation and the healing hand of time will I hope recover my spirits in some degree , but I must for ever sensibly feel the loſs of the most amiable , the most gentle & virtuous Companion that ever man was bleſsed with . Shou 'd the Peace take place , as I hope , I mean to ask Charles Macklin 's leave to return home for a short time to settle some affairs of real consequence to me -- The journey woud also be of use to me . The kind sensibility which The Queen of Naples were pleased to shew & their Gracious expreſsions on Learning of my heavy loſs ( & which have been reported to me by others as well as yourself ) have , as you , may well think , given me great satisfaction , pray when you have an opportunity expreſs my warmest & most respectfull Gratitude to the King -- I have long had the honor of being well acquainted with the tenderneſs & goodneſs of Their Majesties s Heart & no One has ever doubted of that of Their Majesties 's -- Adieu My Dr . Niece Yours most affectionately the King P.S . I have set aside for You an Antique ring , which was constantly worn by poor the Queen , & will send it You by the first opportunity , it is on a Turkey Stone & the Subject is a Perseus . vi a Mantua To Wm : Hamilton at St .
