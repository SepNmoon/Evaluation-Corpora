From Miss S. Dickenson to her sister in law Mrs. J Dickenson Jany 26 . 1807 . My dear Sister Mr : Fletcher proposes to send My Brother s cash in in the basket I have netted for you , as it is to be a casket for your tr easure , I have no doubt of its being acceptable to you , & that its agreeable contents will make ample amends for its numerous deficiencies . I had intended to have netted in a smaller scale , 2 bags for Louisa & Miſs Morrison , but I have not been very well lately ; & since the arrival of Mr Pit s speeches , I have been employd in reading & admiring the astonishing p ow ers of his mind , if I coud expreſs my sentiments as well , I shoud be as enthusiastic as Mr Thomson but I must be content with simply observing I never read any work that gave me more pleasure . I had last night every prospect of my father s having a regular & comfortable fit of the gout in his foot , the inflammation was strong & the swelling had commenced , I got up about 5 this morning , & from the pain he complaind of , conclud ed he was going on perfectly well ; I had not however been with him many minutes before he told me his foot was become easy , & a most violen t & obstinate spasm on the chest took place . I gave him guaiacum & agar & at length he was relieved . I mention this circumstance so fully as I think it tends strongly to prove that the spasm is a gouty affection , & that it does not arise from the cause his medical friends sometimes suggest ; & as this is a very flattering hope to me , I have indulged myself in repeating it to you . Tell my dear Louisa that this day has not been forgotten by her affectionate relatives at Birch Hall . Grand papa tho much better , does not feel well enough to write , but he joins me in sincere wishes for a long continuance of helth & happineſs to her . I have not heard from my sister for some time . I am of course anxious , but the interruptions that must naturally arise to any intercourse with that devoted country , can not be a cause of surprise tho it may be of regret . I am in a fever about the lottery tickets , can you enquire or must I apply elsewhere ; I have not written to her lately , as I woud not finally dash all her airy dreams whilst there was the least hope of their being realised . I have paid the 8:8:0 to Mr Brandt . I propose to take this letter tomorrow ( if my father is tolerably well ) to Manchester when I propose to call on Mr Brandt & gather what intelligence I can from him we are much obliged to my Brother for the presentation , & medicine for the horse , he is now better & the farrier says he will be a very valuable animal to my father , so all thoughts of changing him is given up . you will thank my Brother for the horse , & the vines which I hope will be more productive than their predeceſsors . I am not now going to flourish , or paſs the strict bounds of sober truth when I tell you of the flowers in my garden about the 10 th to 1 5 th of January I had in bloom a jonquil roses purple primrose snow drop hepatica aconite oxlip heartsease bearsfoot , yellow & white potentilla Italian cytiſsus Christmas rose daisies periwinkle laurustinus ; & in full bud a branch of the paſsion tree that had not been in the greenhouses , a while either , anemone & c & c. I heard a throstle sing in december , & a sparrow this morning pickd up a feather to line no doubt its nest . M rs : becky presents her respectful duty to her young mistreſs & desires me to say that being as broad as long is a small matter compared to her weighty charms . Mungo is very fat & very dirty , & angus increases daily in size & good manners , he is no longer the Bonaparte of the neighbourhood , & even sustains courage enables him to br ing the news paper with leſs dismay than formerly . Mrs : Mckenner has been very ill but is now better , the good news of to day has raised Mr M above par , & he coud not make up a sorrowful face all tho his wife has been so Great an invalid Mr Streetly looks very delicate & I think is declining , Dr C continues in excellent mind & the marriage of a third cousin to a man of 4000 a year is an undeniable subject on all occasions . Mrs N & I write notes , & very pretty notes too I aſsure you , & visit very cordially , so I expect we shall not be off the hinges again for some time to come Blagsey is arrived at his ne plus ultra , his insolence & ingratitude can go no farther as I trust there is a final stop to all intercourse of every kind , I am not now sorry , altho I was afraid lest my father might suffer , but as h e s borne this fresh instance of his malignity with tolerable composure , I am disposed to think it a very happy ecclairciſsement . I will not enter into particulars as the detail will be too long for for me to write it to distinctly , but my father will not fail in his next letter to give you a circumstantial account -- Mr. Lucas 's paragon is I believe better , if not quite well . There is a pleasant young woman come to live in this neighbourhood with whose mother I was formally very well acquainted with she has calld upon me with out the ceremony of being first waited upon by me , & I intend to return her visit when my father is quite well . Tell Miſs Morrison if Mr Pit had not croſsed my way , I shoud have finished the trim̄ing
