My dear Miſs Hamilton I had the pleasure of meeting Sir William Hamilton last Night at Lady Amherst s , & there he told me he cd give us the pleasure of his company next Friday Evening -- I therefore trust you will be so good as to meet him . you must not pretend to be Engag 'd , for I will not allow of yr absence -- I have rel 'd sadly since I have seen you . & have heated my self so that I can not Sleep . Therefore I am at home this Evening , & have sent my Mother & Sister such a Goose Chase , & here they are return 'd very much out of humour . But such a mistake have I made about an Engagement for this evening -- I am also in a pack of troubles , for I last Night found a Note from Mrs. Beauvoir I wish Mrs. Chapone had not repeated my vindication -- it was I am aſsur 'd perfectly well meant but I am puzzled to a degree how to answer her . do not mention this Anecdote to Mrs Carter , for I intend to show her the Epistle before I answer it -- for I hate anything like duplicity -- I really think the poor Soul is very Singular -- Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton believe me yr most Affect . DBloſset . Dover St . Saturday Evening --
