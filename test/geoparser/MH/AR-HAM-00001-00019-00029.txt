Canterbury Jany 30 th - 1773 Yours without a date come to hand My dearest Mary to night & I immediately sit down to write a few lines to make this as long as I poſsible can , tho at present I am so hurried with other buſineſs that I am oblig 'd to write many sheets of paper daily and much against my inclination so if they are not so long as uſual you 'll forgive me & whenever I have time shall make them as long as formerly . It gives me extreme concern to find you think Mrs Hamilton s dont mend so well as you could wish but I hope by the next I get that she will be quite as well as I wish her . You mistake me My Dear Girl I did not mean to scold you for the penseros o but only to prevail on you never to indulge it , could it be of any Consequence I would be for it , but where it may hurt yr health without doing any good to anothers I think its wrong for any body to indulge themselves in it , tho its very natural yet I dont think it prudent but as I hope to hear Mrs- Hamilton is quite well in a few days I shall ſay no more at present on the subject -- I shall be very glad that I was mistaken in the Gentleman that made up a part of my last letter , but am afraid its too true as it comes from many good hands & those letters I have heard hurt him greatly with his Uncle , One thing is certain its prudent to keep ſome things to oneself and as those letters cd- never do any good , they had better never been printed & sent about to different people who had not the least concern with the affair . Believe me My dearest Girl that I have not a thought of yr having the least interest in the affair , but I know well that when a Person forms a good opinion of another that it must chagrine one greatly to find themselves mistaken however I shall be happy to find my opinion quite wrong in regard to him , & still more so , as you are the person to set me right , which will flatter me not a little to find my opinion of My dearest Girl 's penetration anſwer in every respect as I could wish , but as you are not very much acquainted a Person with a very common share of sense may impose on the most knowing people for ſome time as there is a plauſibleneſs in ſome folks that can always make their own story right till the other ſide is heard , I dont ſay thats his case , but I am ſure he has acted with very little prudence in most of his transactions in Life at least so I am told by his friends & relations & I am afraid there is too much truth in the report especially as things have turned out a tranquil retirement is what I could wish for him but that I am afraid his romantic turn will never allow him to enjoy . I have heard off the eighteen penny phamplet you speak off but never saw it Adieu till to Morrow My Dearest Girl Sunday morning Jany 31 st . I was obliged to give over last night rather abruptly , as I found myself very far from being well having catched cold some how or other & with it a great cough which did last night greatly distreſs me , together with a shivering fitt like that of an ague however I find myself much better to day & by keeping my room till to morrow hope all will be well again tho my Cold & Cough still continues but I must not imagine that those things are just to go off when one would have them , they will stay there time & lucky we are ev er to get the better of them . I thank you My dearest Girl for burning part of my last , I beg 'd it not that I was afraid of your shewing it but as accident does & may happen I did not think it right that I should have wrote so , of so near a relation , nor would I have put pen to paper concerning him in that way to any Mortal but yourself or Mrs Napier as I am sure I can depend on both . Indeed My dearest Mary I believe you never will give me cause to repent my opinion of you , either for your sincerity or any other virtue a young Lady ought to poſseſs to make her so very amiable as my dearest Ward is , and believe me my sincerity is to be depended upon in every thing I ever write you , as Compliments between us now would be rather too much to bear , since we open our Minds to one another so freely and I hope we ever shall continue to do the same & take nothing for granted of one another from other people , till we come to an ecclaircissement ourselves & than we can have none but ourselves to blame . every body ought most certainly to have an opinion of their own , its only faulty when people carry 's it to too great hieght & in that doing their good manners and even I am afraid their Judgement is often lost out of keenish to support their own Argument but I shall be happy always to hear My dear Mary 's opinion on every subject she writes about , as I am entirely perswaded I shall improve by it as believe me nothing is so apt to give a right turn to a Man 's mind than the opinion of a Lady that he esteems , and I believe its quite reciprocal in both Sexes , or I am ſure it ought to be , & in my opinion I think our Sex will always be the gainer where it is , as I am far from thinking the Male Sex has so much sincerity as the female in many things , from the liberty given in our education excepting in the affair of Love where your Sex are com̄only brought up with more dissimulation not ( from custom ) having the liberty to speak your minds as we have which has been very hard on many poor Girls , especially as its com̄only called the Noble Paſsion why should Men have the priviledge only to make that flame known known to the beloved Person , was it allowed for both to speak their Minds freely I am perswad 'd that we would not see so many unhappy marriages , as both Men & Women will would chuse for themselves & of course would decline an offer they did not like . And I am afraid many Lady 's takes offers where their hearts are not concerned in order to an Establishment which they wd never have taken , were they allowed by custom to ask the Man they would prefer -- If I am not mistaken alas poor Kitten to whom I beg you 'll remember me & that I wish sincerely for the reestablishment of her health -- its now three o'Clock afternoon & I have been writing constantly ever ſince I got up ( & you know I am an early riser ) and have not as yet broke my fast , so you may think I am hungry & very fitt for my dinner which for all that must be a disagreeable one as I dine by myself in my bed chamber which I think must always give the vapours or as you ſay make the penseros o prevail , but I can aſsure you its not the case with me for the instance I began to finish this to you my spirits got up surprisingly and I am quite alive , I shall sink after dinner as I have many more letters to write by this day post , to people I have not the least regard for , but buſineſs must be transacted whither one will or not & its best to do it with a good grace & gulp it down the best way one is able & believe me My dear Girl yt People that lives in the world should have good swallows otherwise they stand a good chance of choking very often Adieu My dearest Mary this is a very pretty lenghth of a letter & double yours however believe me yours most affctly- may every thing good fall to ye share of my ever dear Ward -- remember me to Mrs Hamilton in the most affct way --
