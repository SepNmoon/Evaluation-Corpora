11 , S t . James 's Street , 12 th - April 1799 . My Dear Sister , A Committee , of the Hospital of Incurables , requires my Attendance at Two O'Clock , on an Estate Bill of my Cousin Hope Weir 's , after which , a thin Man with a long Nose , and a large Wig , hears an Appeal from Scotland ; after which , I am summoned to listen to an Application for a Divorce -- There is , likewise , to be a Debate on a Volunteer Bill , and a Conference with the House of Commons , in the Painted Chamber . Now , according to my Calculation , it will be impoſsible for Me to escape from all these weighty Matters between the Hours of three & five . Therefore , I demand an explicit answer to the following question , viz . “ If I can not arrive at the “ Queen 's Flower Maker 's “ before five O'Clock , at what “ other hours are the “ Extraordinary Husband , the “ Amazeful Wife , & the tolerably wel l “ grown , well behaved Girl , “ to be exhibited ? ” I presume , You will dine with Lady Wake , and of course gabble with her till you both talk yourselves , and your auditors to sleep , so that the probability is , that You will not be visible to Me , till after breakfast tomorrow . I write after , for I would have You to comprehend , that I never go out before breakfast . Adieu , Best affections to all the Prodigies . Ever Yours faithfully Napier .
