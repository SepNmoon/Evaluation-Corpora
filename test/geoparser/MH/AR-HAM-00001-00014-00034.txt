Queens Lodge Tuesday 28 Decbr 1779 -- My Dearest -- Tho I have nothing very lively to comunicate yet my Vanity aſsures me that a few lines from your Friend will not be unacceptable , & that you will be pleased to hear that I am well & happy , whether all the Company is I will not venture to aver , for I think I have seen masks of Ennui in a Person or Persons who upon Paper shall be nameleſs . The Weather certainly has not been propitious , We have never walked , therefore except ten Minutes at Breakfast I never see my Gentlemen till 4 o ' Clock I then after that as usual I stay till I have drank Coffee then leave them to attend the Princeſs 's & return when the Q is so gracious as to tell one I may go & drink Tea , our three first Evgs after that were spent in a Circle /for tho I tried I could not destroy it/ round Mrs Hagedorn s Fire till past ten , last Night we had Musick & a Commerce Party which I liked , it consisted of the Princeſs 's , Genl Budé Col Hotham & my Brother , & very comfortable we were , it is a great delight the knowing he is in the House but you see my Dearest by this dull Journal how very little I really see of him , it rains to day , therefore I hope the Princes will be able to Hunt once before they leave Windsor , last Night they got Straits as that was to have been this Morgs diversion but use leſs , & they are a ll gone out to walk in Weather that you & I would not ingly have sent our Foo tmen , this my Drt is a fruitful Narrative of our Xm̄as Hollidays Amusement , tho there is a comfortable circumstance I have omitted viz that we do not breakfast till pt nine , by wc̄h means we avoid dreſsing by Candle Light -- Adieu my Dearest Affectionately Yr .
