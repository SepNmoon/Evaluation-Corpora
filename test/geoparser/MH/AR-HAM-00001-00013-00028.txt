Decbr . 15 t . 1785 Albemarle Street My Dear Miranda I not only love you , but admire that amiable disposition that you are bleſs 'd with ; & your feelings for me , & my Dear Child , upon this melancholy occasion , will endear you to me if poſsible , more then ever : At presant my heart is too full to enter upon the subject of my late loſs . his character in life is too great to be slightly touch 'd upon ; in private life , such a Husband , Parent , Master , & Friend ; none superior , & few his Equals . tears flow so fast , I must stop my pen upon that subject . -- In full confidence I shall keep nothing from you , I will repeat your own words , it is not from curiosity , but real friendship , that you wish to know how my Dear late husband has left his Affairs ; & how Richd has behav 'd upon this occasion , you may be aſsured , not properly , it is not in his nature : at his first coming to Town , he told me , he did not see that his Father appear 'd to be near Death ; & thus he need not have come so soon ; I gave him for answer , that the D r . told me , 2 upon his first coming to Town he was so bad , that had there not been an immediate alteration , he cou 'd not have liv 'd eight & forty hours ; this was the first salutation I receiv 'd from him ; what cou 'd I expect after this behaviour , a dark & sullen contenance , this lasted for six weeks after he returned to Town ; not one word was ever utterd relative to his Father s sufferings , neither my tears , or his Father s Mourns , had any effect upon his mind ; poor unhappy Man ; so was his conduct , that at last , I dreaded the sight of him ; about ten Days before my Dear husband departed , he told me I must prepare for a confusion ; I gave him for answer , that I had met with nothing else since I came into the family , & was prepar 'd against every thing that might happen & so it ended : I perfectly understood the poor retch , that if there had been a loop hole to s natch hold of , he wou 'd have taken the advantage . but I thank God there is none . -- what an unfeeling Creature must he be , he wanted to open his Father s Will himself , which I wou 'd not permit ; I told him it was a discredit to himself , Even to think of it . Mr. Antrobus of spring Garden , & Mr. Thomas Lewis were the two friends that came , upon that melancholy occasion . -- 3 upon seeing them come in , I was ready to drop , but tears came came to my relief ; I can aſsure you it was almost more than a feeling heart cou 'd well bear . -- upon reading the Will , his countenance chang 'd , & he look 'd very happy ; by that we all suppos 'd that it far exseeded his expectation . -- As near as we can gueſs , it is Eleven thousand pound , besides the library , & three hundred pound , I am to pay him , for presant use . -- I am left Executrix & residuary legatee ; all that is personal , is in my power , excepting the Plate , & that for life , then goes to his Son . -- I have reason to believe that my income will be near a thousand a year , or may be full , but at presant I ca n't tell . -- every one admires that noble distribution that he has made , every one perfectly independent of each other Dear Creature , he had a mind too great & noble , to have a narrow thought belong to him . -- My poor Dear Girl , is all gratitude , to me , & her Dear Father . & I fear She at presant , has sufferd in her health health ; but I hope , She will soon be better 4 Our good Friend , Anna maria , has been all goodneſs to us , under all our Afflictions , what a comfort it was to have such a friend . I shall always acknowlede the obligation . & at the same time , I am much oblig 'd to you , & your better half ; for your kind & friendly attention to us ; tell your Dickenson , that I think him worthy of you ; & that is paying him ; the greatest compliment , that can be pay 'd . -- I have receiv 'd his friendly letter , with thanks , but he must not expect an answer , for I have a great dislike to my pen : We have saved a lock of Dear Mr. Glover s hair , if you will be so good as to send the measure of your Finger , I will order a ring to be made . I beg you will present our most respectful compliments to your good Father , & Sisters , & are much oblig 'd to them , for the kind part they took in our Afflictions . Eliz : is got home & desires her best Compliments . -- my head at presant is very full of busineſs . From your most sincere & Affcte . friend . E Glover my love to your good husband
