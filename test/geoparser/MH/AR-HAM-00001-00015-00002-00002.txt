Leuctra Satry . 13 th . Novbr . 1779 I am grieved to ye . “ Soul my Beloved ” Friend to think yt . so many days have paſs 'd away & yt . I should not have had it in my power to write to you -- the last date being the 8 th - -- my time has been indispensably occupied -- Perfecta is absent , & ye . others have been Ill -- last Thursday I spent in nursing Agnés ; -- all ye . time I was with her I could not help thinking yt . if common humanity could make me so attentive -- how I should feel & how I should act was I with any one to whom I was as tenderly attach 'd as to my Astrea yourself for you -- -- Ill yourself and requiring every tender attention -- & to be in danger of being separated -- & by Illneſs too from I—— & yor . F—— -- poor man how I pity him ! Saty . Eve.g . I had wrote thus far very early this Morng . at 9 I went Elise was indisposed wth . a bad Cold . at 1 o'Clock the Post brought me your dear letter -- I dare not read it through till I came home -- but I just comforted myself wth . ye . account of your Health & Is—— thank God You are both better -- they are gone as usu a l to Babel -- Elise , Agnés & the 3 -- & on M onday , P.W & F k——g for the last time this Year -- I shall send what I write to night unfinish 'd that I may not lose another post , & so continue to'morrow & send by Mondays post -- I recd . your letters my love as likewise ye . packets safe -- I wish I could procure franks , I think tomorrow I will venture to send to the Bishop for one or two , & then send send as I promised by Monday nights Post . -- Melsom Street ! perhaps you are lodged in ye . very House Miranda I was was in 3 or 4 Years ago -- I forget ye . name of ye . Landlord -- How such little circumstances my Astrea touch sensibly upon the secret impulses of the mind -- I think one may style them friendly fallacies . Indeed my Dear I blushed as I read ye . praises you so liberally bestow 'd upon me -- knowing that you never wld . write to Miranda me what you did not think , & feeling so conscious that I do not merit so great a character -- it will however make me ambitious of endeavouring to deserve it -- that you may not have to retract your opinion -- Let no presentiments disturb ye . veracity of your mind -- it is wrong very wrong to indulge such a disposition -- the past & present are but too ampl y e fill 'd with circumstances to exercise & keep alive our sensibility without ye . addition of presentiment for my sake , for your own do not , O do no t suffer yourself to be led away by it any more . -- Adieu my Astrea for to night . May the Almighty preserve You & take you under his protection and Oh may you & I deserve the felicity promised in another life , & procured by the ever bleſsed & adored redeemer of Mankind “ To Him , to Him , 't is given , “ Paſsion & care & Anguish to destroy , “ Thro ' Him soft Peace & Plentitude of Joy “ Perpetual o'er ye . World redeem 'd shall flow . Matthew Prior , Solomon on the Vanity of the World , book III . Prior 's Solomon let us with all our best endeavours cultivate ye . love of God for it is only by yt . means our path of duty can be made straight .
