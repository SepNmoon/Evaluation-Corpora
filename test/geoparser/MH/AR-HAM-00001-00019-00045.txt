London Monday night 31 st . May 177 3 You See My dearest Mary that its as impoſsible for me to be content without writing you , as its impoſsible for you to refrain being ſome times ſaucy so allowing both to be true and just I ' ll shall begin to tell you the news . The Dutcheſs of Gloucester brought to Bed of a daughter , Mrs- Hamilton s Snuff in my poſseſsion , Cloe 's Collar ordered & I am in hopes to bring it down with me in a few days , Miſs Thursby sups abroad but her letter is at Mr Warwick 's ( almost next door to me ) I shall call on her before I leave town which I hope will be on Wednesday evening or Thursday morning at furthest tho I can not be sure as I have seen no body as yet , I likeways call 'd abt your two odd Vol . of Les vie de Peintres which Mrs- Dunoyer has not as yet got tho she has been ſeeking them all over town but has promised me to send abroard for them but gives me but little encouragement to expect to get them but My dearest Ward will find that every thing in my power to be done , shall be , to please her & I make no doubt of her being so good as to take the Will for the Deed should Madame Danoyer not succeed . I din 'd at the white Hart St Albans where ye Landlady enquired greatly after Mrs- Keynes ( apropos my best respects to her ) Mrs- Hamilton and her dear amiable sweet Miſs Hamilton ( her very words upon Honor ) she did not at first know me but took me for an Uncle of yours by my likeneſs to the Hamiltons ( what a flattering Speech for me ) & was so fond of me that I began to think the Kitten was quite wrong when she said I had one fault however we agreed so very well about you , that I did not know but I might have been with her still had not John acquainted me the Chaise was ready at ye door however we 'll have the other converſation about you in coming down , especially as My dear Ward s praises is an entertainment I am never weary of hearing , tho never so much fatigued with the tongue of a talkative landlady , so mine Good Hostess at the White Hart may prate as long as she pleaſes providing her converſation runs of a Miſs Hamilton who does me the honor of calling her Guardian how that flatters me is not to be expreſs 'd every body , Man -- Woman & Child is fond of my dear Ward even the bowels of an overgrown fatt LandLady of St Albans yearns for her , til she finds that she is well , O what powers goodneſs and Amiableneſs has can only be known where My dear Ward makes her appearance but let me drop the subject for fear she may think I have taken up Col . Bland s way of Complimenting which if ever she thinks of me I shall bring Mr T in with his abſurd , ridiculous , Nonſenſical Stuff pho Miſs Hamilton wt a stamp of ye Foot on the floor how can you think so , upon my honor seriously I never paid you a Compt in my Life nor never deſigns to do , & I hope you ' ll at least allow me one virtue ( sincerity ) to counterballence my many fold vices , if its poſsible many can be lodged where I flatter myself you regard with a little friendſhip Adieu my Dearest Girl my best Compts to Mrs- Hamilton & return her my thanks for the many Civilities she is so good as shew me which I never can repay so properly as I should I dont know whither you may think this letter a Compt or not but I can aſsure you that conſidering the journey and my running about for four hours constantly on my feet since being in town that I am quite fatigued , but I neither expect or deſire an Anſwer to this . not expect one because I dont give you my derection , not deſire one as I hope to be wt you before it could come so believe me my dearest Mary yours most affctly .
