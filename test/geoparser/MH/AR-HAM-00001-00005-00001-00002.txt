letter of a 1 st . cousin Rev AH Cathcart Wolverton Thursday 1 st Sepbr 1808 My Dear Cousin I was sorry I had not an opportunity of thanking you for your kind letter by the Post of yesterday . I had it in full contemplation to make you a visit about this time & shall be most happy to pay my respects to you & Mr Dickenson on Tuesday next & to stay with you for that night but I must return next day as I have some things going on at home that require my presence . I am very sorry to speak in the first person singular , but Mrs Cathcart in addition to the situation of Encrease has a complaint in her head & altogether is not in visiting order & with much regret must decline accepting your kind Invitation this time . We are much obliged to you for your kind recollection of our Children Arch is at school & Fanny going on in her usual joy of le≈øsons & c . The others are all well . I had heard of Mr Dickenson s migration but not of his return . Pray remember us most kindly to him & Ms Dickenson & Believe me Ever my Dear Cousin most Faithfully Yrs AH Cathcart Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Bedford shire
