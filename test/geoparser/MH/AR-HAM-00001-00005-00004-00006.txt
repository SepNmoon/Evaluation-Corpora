My dear Mrs. Dickenson -- I should have been very happy to have had it in my power to procure two tickets for Ld . Chamberlain 's Box for mi≈øs Dickenson but am afraid it is now so late there is not any chance of being able to get them except it should be accidentally -- I will however enquire & if I can fall on any method of obtaining them will let you know early to morrow I am yours sincerely H Warwick Mrs. Dickenson
