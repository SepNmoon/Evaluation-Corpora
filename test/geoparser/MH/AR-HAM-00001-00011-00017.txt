9 th May 1782 Thursday Morng : I wish you could see me my dr : Miſs H . I look exactly like one of my Poland Hens . & I will tell you why presently . I must first tell you that I had once a Friend ( he is now I trust an Angel in Heaven . ) who in the simplicity of his heart began a Letter once to me -- “ I have it in my power by the “ goodneſs of my merciful God , to give you the very “ great comfort & pleasure of hearing I am well : I know “ continued he , how happy this News will make you & c now I am a little like my good Friend in thinking that you will be very sorry to hear I am not well ; that I have got a Cold , & the worst of it is , that it is such a Cold as makes it impoſsible for me to dreſs -- now I should not have minded another sort of Cold , but this has vexed me , for it hinders me from paying my Duty to One to day , to whom I would wish to shew every Respect -- this Respect , as Madme : de Genlis says , of outward form , as well as that Respect of the Heart -- which those must feel , who honor & respect revere Virtue & goodneſs : this I can say better to you , than I could to the Queen herself for the reason s Madme : de Genlis gives , wh : I am sure you must remember . -- it is impoſsible for me , who have had the Honor of seeing those Virtues , as I have done without being impreſsed & I hope profiting as I ought by them -- My cold lies in my throat , & I am now dreſsed up in a black feather Tippet , ( the warmest of all warm things , wh : I have been aſsured will cure me , ) & that make my Resemblance to my prety poland Hen -- tho ' I must say She becomes her bustling feathers more than I do . I shall certainly be at home all the Evg : & only Mrs.- Carter , & some very intimate Friends , so if you can look in upon me , I sd : be happy to see You -- believe me Yrs .. sincerely PDartrey Miſs Hamilton S : James 's --
