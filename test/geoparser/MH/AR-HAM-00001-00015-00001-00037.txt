Margate October 27 th 1789 My dear Friend ! I will say nothing of the time that has elapsed since I received your letter . In August I think it was -- this is October ! shocking indeed , and as there is no justifying so long a silence , even by your example I will not attempt to excuse it . various indeed are have been the Events & circumstances of the last 3 Months ! you will be surprised to hear that we are at this place , we who never move from Horton , from June to January ! poor Bell has been very ill all the Summer , with a low fever & other nervous complaints , and Dr Kerr thought seabathing absolutely neceſsary in October -- we fixed upon this place as the nearest to London & at the same time the most certain as to the poſsibility of bathing every day , & we arrived here I think about the begini n g first of this month , after stopping two days in Town in our way . we like it vastly , the country about it & almost the whole Island is extremely pretty , & the walks & drive 's beautiful -- the place was very full when we arrived , tho ' not of People we knew -- the only acquaintance we found were Colel & Mrs Stanhope -- Mr & Mrs Steele -- Ly E . & Mr York & Ld Winchilsea -- they are all gone long since the place is quite deserted & the only people left are Mr & Mrs Arthur Stanhope , whom we have become acquainted with since our arrival here whom we live with every day , & like extremely . Bell has received the greatest imaginable benefit from the bathing , & air , her strength and appetite are returned & every bad sympt om abated , if not removed -- my Father is very well , his havi n g no object to interest him & no occupation , & havi n g long since gratified his curiosity in riding about the Country , he is quite tired of the place -- we leave it tomorrow sev'night , make a visit on our road to London & shall be there about the 9 th -- my Father stays there two or three days on busineſs and then returns to Horton till the begin n i n g of December , Bell & I duri n g that time shall be at Richmond & St Leonards & we shall all meet & settle in Town at before Xmas . I must now my dear Friend tell you a piece of news that will surprise you at the same time that I am sure it will give you pleasure . I must preface my communication , tho ' by an injunction of secrecy & must beg you not to mention it to any body for some time to come . Inshort my dear Friend , I am at last going to be married to Mr D—— -- I see your astonishment , when you recollect how seriously I aſsured you that there was not a word of truth in the reports that prevailed upon that subject , but I give you my word that what I said was truth , & that two months ago I had no idea of the poſsibility of an event now so near taking place -- it is impoſsible to tell you , or even myself how it has been brought about -- suffice it to say that tho ' the original obvious objections to the connection still remain , I have brought myself to submit them , to the consideration of Mr D 's merits & good qualities & that I really believe I have every prospect of rea son able happineſs -- it is not to take place until the beginni n g of January -- Mr D is now in Dorsetshire with his family , we saw him for a few days just before we left Horton & when we came here he went to Windsor & then in to Dorsetshire -- the King & Queen who were extremely kind & gracious upon the occasion desired that it might be kept a secret for some time to come -- so I trust to you -- I have not yet thanked you my dear Friend for your long letter , I am truly hapy to hear that you are quite recovered & that Mr Dick : has receivd so much benefit from Bath I have only time to desire you will remember us all to him , & our love to dear little Louisa who I imagine grows more & more a comfort & delight to you every day . I have said nothi n g of myself , I was in perfect Health till a week ago & since that time have had a return of this old old pain in my stomack which I suffered from for so many years -- I hope it will leave me -- I am sufferi n g cruelly at this minute & must leave you my dear Friend , after havi n g aſsured you of my sincere attachment & Friendship -- adieu God bleſs you -- most affec : yours C. M. G—— Bell is not goi n g to be married , there was no truth whatever in the report you heard . To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
