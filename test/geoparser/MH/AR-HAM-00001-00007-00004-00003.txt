Mr. Farhill & Bishop Fisher of Exeter 22 d Janry- I have just finished Julia de Roubigné : I am delighted with it beyond measure ; the second volume is I think far preferable to the first ; this may however arise from my Love of Episode : the Incidents however are more numerous & more interesting -- I coud scarcely help giving a Tear to Yambu & the Catastrophe made my heart palpitate as much as if I had been concerned in the Tragedy . The end Conclusion is a natural one in short I think it a delightful Novel . I gave your Watch to Mr. Miller , he said it coud not be ready for you in leſs than a fortnight . I told him you wanted it in a Week . his Reply was that the Impatience of the Ladies prevented them from ever having good watches : He thought you had been an exception to the general Rule . I told him a Fortnight woud do . I hear nothing , I see nothing I mean to pay my respects to Ld Napier tomorrow morn . Adieu believe me most sincerely your 's I aſsist the Philosopher in his most abstruse Studies & yet I am to be seen in every place of public amusement and diſsipation . The Charms of the Woman of Fashion are heightened by my presence & I am of advantage a nd comfort to the lowest orders . of m ankind . My Existence is in gener a l short duration & my decay profor m l to the Benefit which others received from me . With me the Statesman consults for the good of his Country & the Divine for the honor of Religion , with me who am in every Scene of nocturnal Riot and Debauchery . Notwithstanding this I am very frequently admitted even to your Private Parties & I may without vanity aſsert that whenever I leave them your Smiles immediately disappear .
