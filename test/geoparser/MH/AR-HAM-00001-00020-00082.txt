Merchiston Hall 3 rd July 1783 . I have the satisfaction , my Dear Sister , to acquaint You that the 24 th . of last Month I was put on Half Pay , by which agreable Circumstance my Income from £ 417 pr . An . is reduced to £ 285 . How I am to manage , I know not , neither have I fixed on a place of Residence . My inclination sends me Abroad , but my finances I fear are too slender to make me comfortable in a Strange Land . Now Madam , as to my letters which you pretend have been contradictory I have only to observe , That if Miſses are Galloping about the Country like Vagabonds it is no fault of mine if they do not receive their letters properly . Neither is there any Act of Parliament by which A Man is prevented altering his Opinion -- When I wrote You my prudent letter I had not acknowledged to myself that I was in Love with a Miſs without a large Fortune -- but now that I have made the discovery I have also lear n't that Oat Cake Potatoes & Milk with a Beef stake for Sunday 's dinner , is quite sufficient to support Nature . And besides , as the Gout is Hereditary in my family , nothing can be so proper as living Abstemiously . As to the Lady , the happineſs She must feel from belonging to me is sufficient to compensate for any triffling inconveniencies she may experience . Thus Madam have I brought myself to reason , and doubt not of your being perfectly convinced of the propriety & justice of my Argument . If You are not , You must impute it entirely to your own want of Comprehension not to any defect in my Theory -- I shall most undoubtedly disobey your Commands about my Neice , as I would not hold her in my Arms Ten Minutes for as many hundred Pounds -- I would certainly have answered your Verse in Verse , could I have suffered myself to have been outSternholded . I ever prided myself on my Genius for that kind of Versification and was therefore not a little provoked that You had presumed to invade my Province , and as I knew nothing could be more mortifying to a fine Lady ( like You ) than a certain kind of contemptu ous Silence I determined to indulge the inveterate Rancour so natural to me , and accordingly took no kind of Notice of your Poetry . Lord Napier presents his very best respects to Mr . Mrs- & Miſs F. Hamilton , is Shocked inexpreſsibly at having so long neglected to enquire particularly after their health , begs they will beleive they have ever occupied a large Share of his Recollection and presumes to add that his constant Prayers will be for their Health , Wealth and Long Life -- Pray Miſs will the above satisfy You ? A Town House & a Country House ! ! ! I suppose your next habitation will be the Fleet or Kings Bench . Or perhaps we shall read a Paragraph in the News papers as follows “ We hear that yesterday a Lady who formerly occupied a Place of Distinction in the Royal Nursery Absconded from her House in Clarges Street to the great Discomfiture of a Numerous Body of Creditors . It is added that She has escaped into the Wake of a certain Bedfords Northamptonshire Baronet -- Adieu . But stop a little . It is now neceſsary to inform You that I have for these last three Weeks been on a Tour of Visits in Stirlingshire . I am at present at my Uncle Captain Napier s. The latter end of this Week I go to Lord Binning s & the end of the Week following remove myself to Edinburgh for the Races . Adieu encore . Ever Your Affectionate Friend and Brother N—— .
