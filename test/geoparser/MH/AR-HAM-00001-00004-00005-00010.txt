Characters of Queen & King She no courtier This part typed Naples May 14 th - 1778 I am ashamed My Dear Miſs Hamilton of my own indolence , but I do asſure you , tho ' my pen has not been employ 'd in telling you so , you take up much of my thoughts & I hope I need not tell you how large a Share you poſseſs in my Affections . -- but I must now reproach you , & call you to account it is by mere chance that I have just learnt that you have been very ill of the Putrid Sore throat but are perfectly recover 'd , if I had heard the first part without the latter & let your own heart tell you how much I should have Suffer 'd I hope this hint will be sufficient , & that all my future intelligence about you will be from yourself . -- We are at present at our Villa upon the foot of Mount Vesuvius , ( the Court being at Portici ) & I wish I could convey to your imagination the beautifull prospect I have from the place where I am writing looking over the King s Bosquet & the Bay bounded by the Mountains of Sorrento , I love this Villa , but my principal attachment to it is the quiet I enjoy ( altho ' so near the gayest Court in Europe ) the fact is I never go near it but when it is absolutely neceſsary I should pay my Court , or that the Queen sends for me , Her Majesty has always treated me with the greatest kindness , & says she wishes to see me more , & last Thursday sent me word her Apartment was open for me a toutes heures de jour et nuit , that was her expreſsion but I shall continue my old Plan of keeping the greatest & most respectfull distance , I am able , I am a bad Courtier , & I know her Majesty 's disposition too well to place any confidence in any encouragement she may please s to give me -- I should not venture to say all this to you if my letter was to go by the Post but I send it by Mr Carnegie brother to Sr David Carnegie who is order 'd to join his Regiment & as there are some Characters you may be curious to know I may now speak freely to you -- & to proceed with that of the Queen -- She is quick , clever , insinuating when she pleases , hates & loves violently , but her Paſsions of both kind paſs like the Wind , she is too proud , & too humble , there is no dependence upon what she says , as she seldom is of the same opinion two days , her Strongest & most durable Paſsions are Ambition & Vanity the latter of which gives her a strong disposition to Coquetry , but the former which I think is her principal Object makes her use every Art to please the King in order to get the Reins of Government into her hands , in as great a measure as is poſsible -- with all this she is an excellent Mother , & is very generous & charitable -- did you ever know such a compound ! The King is in many things a direct contrast to the Queen , he has neither education or Art , it is a thousand pitys he has not the former , for he deserves it , his heart is excellent & his head by no means defficient , on the contrary he has an uncommon deal of quickneſs , he is sincere constant in his friendships , benevolent , a natural disposition to justice , & his love to please is so genuine that I know numberleſs instances where he has done good natured actions , so entirely for his own satisfaction that he has not wish 'd it to be known from whence their Source came he can not bear a lie , nor does he ever forget the Man whom he has caught in one he has a great regard for the Queen , & She has some weight with him , but he sees a good deal into her Character & will have his own way the Queen Shows some favour at times to the French but The King detests them , & indeed is often Scarcely civil to them the next person whom I shall mention to you is the Count de Clermont the French Ambr . who is the weakest poor Man Alive , so weak , that I wish he was first Minister at Versailles , at the Age of fifty he has fallen a Prey to the most Gallant Woman here ( the Marqse . de Santo Marco ) who laughs at him & ruins him , the Portuguese Minister is a good sort of Man , The Sardinian , clever , but a true Piedmontese -- The Count de Lambert who is coming from Vienna a very agreable Man -- The Danish Minister just arrived ( who is the only married one except the Venetian Resident ) I shall have little comfort in as they can not live without gaming -- as to the rest they are not worth speaking of -- in the Winter we have a fatiguing time , as we have scarcely an hour to ourselves , the past one I think would have killd me had it not been for the friendship & kindness of that charming Man & Woman , Ly Betty and Mr Mackenzie whose goodneſs to me I shall never forget , upon particularly upon a foolish Affair where their aſsistance was very eſsential to one of so anxious a temper as you know mine to be -- the Affair I speak of was concerning Ly Maynard whose Lord first wanted to force me to receive her visit , & then to present her to The Queen of Naples , neither of which I chose to do , as I could not venture to ask an Audience & answer ( as is the Etiquette of this Court ) for a person I had reason to believe My own Sovereign would not receive , ( I suppose you know who Ly Maynard was ? ) in consequence of my refusal I underwent a reall persecution & by the end of the Winter I was quite worn out with it -- if ever you see Ly Betty she can give you an account of the whole for I really am sick of the thought , & still more as I hear they intend returning here next Winter & they have already declar 'd they will do every thing to torment us -- but enough of this very unpleasant Subject & I must now return to the Subject of our present pleasant situation in the Country , where we live as English a life as we can make it -- in the Morning we go out in an Open Chaise , I work , & draw -- & in the Evening we have musick -- & afterwards I work & Sr Wm . reads to me , & you can not think with what pleasure I heard him tell an Italian the other day who wonder 'd at our not going to the Conversaziones a mile off , that our Evenings paſs 'd so pleasantly that he could not have the heart to try a change -- as to me , in almost thirteen Years ( which it is since we first came from England ) I have never made a friendship or I should rather say intimacy , with any Woman here tho ' I have been upon a perfect good footing with them all , their education & way of thinking is so totally different from ours that there is no temptation to it , & I am convinced they like me much better for not chusing to enter into their private Coteries , & by that means I am now & then at liberty to to take that rest I am now enjoying at our Sweet Villa -- we have a charming Room for Musick , & my Piano forte is placed just Vis a vis to the Vesuvius which now & then heats me with an explosion while I am playing , the other Night there was the finest Girandole of red hot Stones you can imagine , it made an amazing report but we play 'd on as you would if you had heard a pop gun in the Street -- See what custom does ! -- I can not help however longing from time to time to be in England , & was my My Mind at ease when I am there , I dare say the Climat e would aggree very well with me but till our Circumstances are a little better & our Estate clear I could not feel comfortable , not that we are saving here , but we are not augmenting the debt tho ' we spend our own -- & we could not avoid increasing it in England unleſs I could persuade Hamilton to retire into Wales , which he is not inclined to do , but he always tells me that he dedicated his Services to his Sovereign when their family was first form 'd , & that he hopes to go on in his Career & dedicate the rest of his life to his Service -- You may imagine this is sufficient to Silence me -- & I must comfort my self with the thoughts of Visiting Dear England now & then , What a now & then My Dr Miſs Hamilton ! upon reflection I dare not look so forward -- I should grow melancholy if I dwelt any longer upon this Subject -- pray let me know if you have seen much of Ly Stormont , & how you like her ? -- & write me word every thing about yourself , you know how much I have your happineſs at heart -- I am comforted when I think of your situation , know how to prize your own happineſs My Dear Miſs Hamilton -- I know you love and admire The Queen , but did you know s other Sovereigns -- I think you would doubly bleſs the kind providence who ha d placed you where you are -- I am ready to Say of our Queen as Prince Poniatowski did of The King of Poland I was asking him some questions relating to him & he said “ il a tant de Vertus , tant de qualités aimables auſsi bien qu'eſsentiel , qu'il merite d'être un Particulier ” -- I think this Speech was strongly expreſsive of the loſs private Society had , by the King s being so much above it -- if ever you have a proper opportunity I wish you would present my Duty in th a e proper most respectfull manner to her Majesty -- & pray let me know in your next how their Royal Highneſses do -- ? & whether The Prince Adolphus is as beautifull as ever ? -- likewise let us know circumstantially how Their Majesties do ? we may depend upon what you tell us , but not upon the Newspapers or other intelligence , & when we read of the indisposition of either it makes us very uneasy as you may readily imagine -- Hamilton joins with me in very kind love & I am ever My Dr Miſs Hamilton Yr Most Affectionate Aunt & Sincere friend CHamilton Our United love to Mrs Hamilton Sr Wm . has been laughing at my Ardour as he calls it , I have been longing that Old Ad . Knowles 's Scheme should be put in execution , he said it could be easy for three or four Ships to run into Brest with a fair Wind & burn all their Shipping & he would willingly be the first Ship -- only think of my being grown a Politician , but I am out of patience with french Deceit -- in the corner of this letter you will find a Maltese R ing
