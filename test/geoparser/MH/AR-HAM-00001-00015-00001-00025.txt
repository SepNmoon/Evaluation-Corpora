31 st . March 1788 St James 's My dear Friend ! So you did not come last night ? indeed I hardly expected you from what Mr D . said -- I am very impatient & anxious to see you in comfort , when shall I have this pleasure -- shall I come to you this Evening at 9 o clock for an hour -- or will you come to me tomorrow Eveni n g between 8 and 9 -- or shall I call on you at any hour tomorrow morni n g , or will you come here at any hour -- consider of all these proposals & let me know which you accept of that I may arrange things accordingly -- I am going to dine out with my Friend Mrs Milbank in my great cap , & shall do much the same thing tomorrow -- I am rather better tho ' last night my fever was very high -- I have been unwell for these some weeks past and having now grown worse I shall probably get well -- I shall keep quiet till Wednesday when I wish to be quite stout & well for my Brother 's Ball -- I am sure you will stare at this , but he has been so amiable & good naturd as to give us a little Dance whils t my Father is out of Town -- just ten couple which is as much as the room will hold ; It will probably be very pleasant , at leas t a small thing has always a bette r chance of being so -- & I should be sorry as well for George as myself were I unable to enjoy it -- my Father is very well thank God & is enjoying this heavenly weather at Horton where he has been since Thursday & where he stays till the House is aired & cleaned after the Ball -- I hope you & Mr Dickenson will come & dine with us when he return s which will be on Friday or Saturday he will be very glad to see you in Saville Row , as well as at Horton where we all reckon on your prom ise of comi n g next summer -- & bri n gi n g the little rosy Louisa -- I did not tell you this , as I ought to have done in answer to your letter because what with hurry & what with indolence I have never had the power or resolution to write , tho ' I have constantly had the idea & the inclination -- But my dear Friend you must not be angry with me for my silence or judge by it of my regard but believe that I am as much interested about you as ever -- adieu send me an answer & believe me most affecly yours C. M. Gunning To Mrs Dickenson No 5 George Street Hanover Square
