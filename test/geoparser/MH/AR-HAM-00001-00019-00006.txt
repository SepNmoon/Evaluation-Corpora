Abbey July 8 th 1769 By this time I fear my Dear Miſs Hamilton will be tempted to strike me entirely off the Civill list for being so long in her Debt for a very obligeing Letter but I hope you know me too Well to doubt of my friendship or desire to hear good Acts : of you & to know how you all go on -- but realy this is the first attempt towards it I 've been able to make . I received yours upon the road down & a few days after I Contracted so violent a Cold & inflamation in my Eyes that I 've been half blind ever since & still am in the Hands of the Learned tryeing to get Well if poſsible -- : besides I was quite wore out & miserable on Mary & Harriot s accounts who both were extreamly Ill all the way with feavers & Agues the bad effects of which still sticks by them especialy Mary for whom our Anxiety is not yet at an end -- . I was obliged to ret ir e for a fortnight to the Country at first comeing down to enable me to encounter the Hurry & bustle of Setling ourselves here -- : which is more than we have yet been able to accomplish -- haveing a whole House to furnish which in this part of the World is no easy matter to do to ones mind -- besides that Receiveing & returning Visitts & civilitys is a sort of work that leaves one no time to do any thing else -- so that if I did not hope it would soon come to a conclusion I should be something more than quite tired -- . We are all much obliged by yr kind Anxiety about us ; litle Jane held out amazeingly & continues to thrive I wish you were near enough to shew yr Skill in the Nurseing way wt her . since yr Babylonians are demolisht I wish you a better Sett in their room to be sure Ld North.ptn : has the true Anti qu e taste -- : two old Wives would be rather too much for one man if his Loſs had the least dash of Modern gout -- . has yr Pappa heard lately from Edinburgh ? I have twice since being here they all continue in high Health & Spiritts are much careſsed & of course pleas 'd wt their Situation -- my Br I find has time to write to nobody himself ; but yr Aunt & Cousins does . Poor D : Hamilton I 'm very Sorry for ; they say he was a very Aimiable Youth & would proveably have made a fine figure in Liffe his Death was foreseen by most people except his own familly the present Duke is a fine Lively Healthy Boy . Yesterday Mr Douglas gained his Law suit against Ld Selkirk Unanimously my Ld attempted to dispoſseſs him of a considerable part of his Estate -- . we are at present all in a Bustle wt our Races , which has collected a great deal of good Company together -- . I wish all of you would think of comeing amongst Us we shall ever rejoice to See you at all times & in all places mean time I wish this may reach you Soon -- I 've given a Member some Covers to frank for you -- not thinking it worth yr while to pay postage for my Letters . such is the hurry I at present live in ; that though this was begun the 8 th 't is now the 20 th I shall conclude it however by beging you to accept of all our most affectionate good Wishes ; we hope Mr & Mrs Hamilton will do the same Your Cousins are very Buſsie in different ways but all as much Yours as ever Adieu my Dear Miſs Hamilton bellieve me Ever Your Affectionate & most Humble Servant M A Napier July 25 th My Covers are but this moment return 'd to me -- ; do write me a full Act : of Yourselves soon in tocken you admitt my Excuse for Sillence -- once more A dieu -- Direct to me at the Abbey -- Ruſsia
