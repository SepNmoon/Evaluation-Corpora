Wednesday 22 d June 1785 My Dear Mrs : Dickenson As we go out of Town on Saturday & shall not see you , I send a few lines by Miſs A. C . with my Mother 's Affectionate love to you & Mr D—— to say how very happy you will make us by your intended visit to Sunning Hill , when you have fix 'd your time you will be so good as to send us a line , I wrote to my father last night , you may be very sure he will rejoice very much , at the thoughts that his dear Child is at last made happy for life which I am sure is the case ; I hope my Dr . Mrs : D .. my sincere friend when I was but a child , & whose friendship I hope I shall always deserve will permit me to write to her every now & then , when she goes into Derbyshire , where she will meet with relations who must & will love her . may every bleſsing & happineſs that this world affords attend you & yours is the very sincere wish of your ever Affectionate & sincere friend Mary Glover turn over My Mother & Myself are extremely anxious to have our Dear Anna Maria with us in the Country on account of her health , she assured us last night that she was very well but I think she looks ill , she told us that Mr Jackson talks of finishing their affairs , that being the case we shall not see her so soon as we could wish , do you think he really will set about them , I have been thinking ( if you see it proper ) that perhaps if you was to write to him , it might have some effect upon him , I am very well convinc 'd that if he goes not on harraſsing her ( for I can call it nothing else ) it will very materially injure her health . Adieu my Dr . Mrs. D & excuse the liberty I have taken , but I do very sincerely love my Dr . & amiable miſs A. Clarke . & can not help being very anxious . Thursday morning We are so unfortunate as to be engaged to day to Mrs. Wilson s at Sydenham or should otherwise have accepted your kind invitation with pleasure .
