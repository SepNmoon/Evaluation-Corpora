My Dear Miſs Hamilton I beg you will deliver the enclosed to my dear Princeſses , & write me a few Lines to say how the King & Queen & all the Family are after the Distreſsing Scene they have gone thrō with so much Suffering & Resignation , that my heart really bleeds when I think upon it . I can not describe to you the Blank I felt yesterday Morning , at my first Waking , to find All gone , & nothing around me but Silence & Melancholly . I hope the Change of Scene has been some Relief to All ; the Reflexion on the Happineſs of the dear little Object of this sorrow , must be our great Consolation . I have now a little difficulty of my own to mention , that I beg you will show to the Queen , & ask her Majesty s Permiſsion to lay it before the King . The Case is this . As his Majesty was so good as to say I might have my family here as soon as I could , now my Houſe was ready to receive them , I settled with Harriet that they should all come down on Friday , & write to Mr Secker to inform him of it , & to desire he would give the neceſsary Orders concerning my Table , which I understood , his Majesty was pleas 'd to grant me just in the same manner I used to have it from the Prince s Kitchen at Kew . he sends me in answer that the Diet shall be order 'd accordingly , but that the Dishes & Plates & c : belonging to my Table not being yet sent down , he can not send them till he has an order from his Majesty himself . I wish 'd to have waited till his Majesty s return before I troubled him about such a Subject , but I am so totally unprovided with any thing of the Sort , that I find myself under the neceſsity of presuming to trouble his Majesty to signify his Pleasure abt . it , & have sent this by my own Servant , that he may proceed immediately to London to Mr Secker , if his Majesty will be graciously pleas 'd to give the neceſsary Order . I feel quite distrest at my own Presumption ( especially at this Time ) but hope from the King & Queen 's Goodneſs , the neceſsity of it will plead my Excuse . I shall certainly not Sleep out of this Houſe , till the dear little Child 's remains are removed , but in the Course of the day it would be a Consolation & Satisfaction to have my family to go to , & also very convenient for seeing every thing settled against I go into it . My Servant will wait to receive the Orders you will convey to him , & I remain my Dear Miſs Hamilton Most faithfully & Affly . Yrs . CFinch Lower Lodge . August 22 d . 1782 . To Miſs Hamilton
