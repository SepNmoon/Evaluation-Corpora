Schaw Park June 10 th 1773 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton s obligeing Letter gave me the greatest Pleasure -- . doubly so , as the lenth of yr Sillence led me to fear you was tired of so Stupid a Correspondant I 'm sorry you turned what I told you of my buſsied Situation so much to my disadvantage as to deprive me of the pleasure of hearing how you & Mrs Hamilton do . I have always leisure to read & be pleas 'd with yr Letters though I told you fairly my Inability of being at all times a punctual Correspondant but I own when I did so , I was in hopes of procureing yr Indulg e nce for these Irregularity 's when they did happen -- but by no means intended depriveing myself of that Pleasure yr Letters never faill to give me . I have many thanks to return Mrs Hamilton & you for all yr Goodneſs to ; & attention for my Lord : bellieve me we are both gratefuly Sensible of it . I wish he had prevailled with Mrs Hamilton & you to have gone to Buxton -- I am certain it would have been of use to her Health & would have made him very Happy -- I am very glad you tell me she is so much better both of you may Ever depend upon my best Wishes for yr Health & Happineſs in all respects ! pray wt is become of poor Miſs Litchfield ? of whom neither my Lord nor you mentions one Word -- . if at Northampton Northampton pray make my best compts : acceptable to her -- I came here with my Br : the 1st of this Month & am very Happy with him & his familly , as fine a one as you ever saw : this place too is dellightfull I shall remain here till within a few days of my Lord s return when I shall meet him at Edr : this I imagine will be the 28 th or 29 th mean time when you write be so good as to direct to me under my Brs : s Cover at Schaw Park by Alloa part of yr young friends are here with me the rest are well at home all of them much yours , & yr Mamma 's they join with my Br : & me & every part of this familly in Affect : compts : to you & Mrs Hamilton I ever am my Dear Miſs Hamilton s most Affectionate & most Humble Servant M A Napier
