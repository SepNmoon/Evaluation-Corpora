Sunday Morng . 10 oClock 20 st . . June 1779 How could my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend write so cruel a Letter . to me . I thought you knew how sacred a meaning ye . word friendſhip carries with it . That which I have for you is of the purest kind , and as durable as any earthly thing can be . You say that yr . friendship can not be of any consequence to me either now or hereafter , by Heavens it is more than you can imagine , for you are the only Friend to whom I can communicate my most hidden & inward thoughts ; you desire me to excuse you as if you had committed a fault in accepting of my friendship , consider I ſhall not , if I lo os ſ e you as my Friend , have a single person whom I can treat with that openneſs , frankneſs and sincerity as I treat yourſelf recollect the promises we made each other of a firm and everlasting union . You say you wish me not to forget you immediately . If you can suppose as you mentioned in yr . Letter , that either the gaiety , o f r vain pageantry of the World , will be the cause of my forgetting you , know , that the dear image of my Friend will never be effaced out of my heart . I flatter myself that my sentiments are such upon this sacred subject as to encourage you to continue to treat me with that confidence which you hitherto have done . Adieu , et soyez persuadé que ni du lieu la distance , ni du temps la longeur vous effaceront jamais du cœur Les poésies françaises de Guillaume van Exaerde / Guillaume van Exaerde , Diversche gedichten van verscheyde materiën , 1675 . de celui qui sera charmé de se signer toujours votre très affectionné Ami . P.S . Let me see you more in spirits this morning at Prayers I beseech of you , & let me hear or receive a promise from you that yr . melancholy shall quit you . I consent according to yr . desire to drop our clandestine intercourse by Letter , unleſs something particular happens concerning which I wish to ask yr . advice . I return you yr . too cruel words pour toujours and desire you will revoke them by destroying the piece of paper upon which they are written . Adieu jusqu ' a u revoir .
