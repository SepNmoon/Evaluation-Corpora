Dear Rev Frederick Hamilton , Nothing but the constant hurry that I have been in since my return to Bath coud have prevented my returning you thanks much sooner for your most obliging letter . I can aſsure you with the utmost sincerity , that I was really distreſs 'd in not having an opportunity of aſsuring you in person that my sentiments towards you are in every respect such as you coud wish ; I have long felt great satisfaction by the accounts of your excellent conduct ; you have not a more zealous friend than Miſs Hamilton & whose judgement can be better relied upon ; he informs me you are to be of his party to Spa . Your account of the danger you was in made me tremble , I hope you have not sufferd by the frights for I know you have weak nerves . My Daughter is amazingly improved & I may say without partiality is a very handsome Girl with many accomplishments . I wish she had a little of your steadineſs , I mean preparing for our departure from Bath , which will be in about three weeks . I have taken a very good House in Dublin for one year & propose to paſs two or three months at my Living in the North . I cou 'd have wish 'd to have met with so much indulgence as not to have been call 'd upon to residence , I have never as yet experienced the least favor or aſsistance from my Friends & it is now owing entirely to Ld . Dartry that I am re duced to this disagreeable neceſsity , which I shoud by no means h a ve yielded to were it not from the attention due on my part to my Children . If I can be of any service to Ld Abercorn in Ireland she will find me heartily disposed to obey her comm ands I aſsure you I never meant to give her the smallest uneasineſs , n or had I any idea of the busineſs that occasion 'd it when I left her at Northampton . I can not expreſs how much I regret having miſsd the opportunity of seeing you as I hardly know when I may have another ; in the mean time I have real satisfaction in knowing that you have good connections & with persons that are sensible of your merit , but as independence is the prime object in this life I shall be happy when you inform of any decisive step Daughter desire to join with me in affectionate Compts . to Mrs. Hamilton and you . I am with great regard Dear Mrs. H . Your faithful & Affect . Humble Servant Miſs Hamilton Bath May 11 th . 1776 .
