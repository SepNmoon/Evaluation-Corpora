My dear Mrs : Dickenson -- What a strange Woman you are , very few like you , and woe be to you if being singularly amiable and respectable be a crime -- You have honord me first and flattered me secondarily , all together I dont know how to repay your kindneſs but by an aſsurance that tho out of sight you have not been blotted from my remembrance , far from it -- When I knew you a little , I liked you a little when I had a better acquaintance , I thought as your husband -- Little Louisa -- and you tell me of a boy -- I sincerely gratulate you both on the charming circumstance of independance -- pray what think you of that mortal who is far from independance yet must declare himself happy by comparison -- I shall say something of your nose before I get to the bottom of my paper on the 4 th Side -- Mr : D . you are idle enough to ask if I have seen a match for Lady D. V . since I left you , how could a man of your sense marryed to a Woman of so acute a nose as MD . ask such a Q . I tell you nay , nor you in the vast vortex of hoops and pettycoats in which you may move if you please -- but softly , you appear to me to love confinements and one petty thing is enough for a reasonable Man -- Mrs D . by this and by that I will not willingly offend you , but do , think a moment what animal creatures we men are , and you will excuse me -- It is too ridiculous certainly to dwell upon , yet we who are candid must allow it . The sensible generosity of elderly Mr : D . is to be praised and highly , if that sort of conduct were more generelly pursued , the World would be better inhabited , and by a better race than the present , tho I love things present . I thank you 1000 times for the kind communications of your letter wch . I have as yet red but once and am talking to You of , only by recollection -- Yours was accompanied by a flight of letters from people whom I either like or love -- If I liked you once , I really love you tho ' you are the bosom friend of another man , and why , because , which you know is a pretty salvo and usually saves reasoning -- Were I to tell you who I like , I should give you a long roll of shapes and sizes , eyes teeth hair and those things included , but when I come to make a catalogue of those I love it would perhaps appear long , and that I not acquired a right to love so many , yet I could give you a list , know , that I would not set Lady D. V . at the head , because -- Because I have the happyneſs of knowing such as ( in my opinion ) deserve to sit on the same bench with her Lp . They are not Legion -- Madame Pompadour 's opinion is that a beautiful Womans face is the highest and most pleasing proof of the skill of the divine Architect , but how could that sensible Creature be so incorrect , ought she not to have reflected on the vanity of tastes fancies caprices & ca which exist in this very pleasant and whimsical World which is too good for the most of us -- The man is smitten with a face , and then with the bust of a fine statue , but when we would represent that charming creature Woman as an object of admiration and desire , let us not hear a Word of mutilation , let us have the tout ensemble which was the original design -- I could now as if she sat for her picture give you my sketch of L de V . but you know her -- She is manly but not masculine -- She is feminine but not effeminated -- I imagine that her fancy is under the immediate correction of a vigilant and enlightened mind , or which must be the case with every fine Woman -- I honor I revere I admire her , and think she has few equals , what wld . you have -- ? now the confidence I must have in your understanding ! I am certain that when I shall reread your letter I shall find questions to be answerd , in the mean time let me aſsure you that I am with great sincerity your much honord and obliged servant -- When a man has so high an opinion of the wit genius , understanding and impartiallity of a Woman , as to prove the praiseworthy qualities of another female he is entitled to thanks , then pray signify your gratitude in your next , for I hope you will not treat me with a bite of a cherry , but supply me with a monthly magazine of knowledge and pleasure -- Know that I have not written to the end of Oxford Street ( Tho I received proof of hospitallity & ca . ) As Mr : Jackson was your host , I beg you will say a kind word to him -- I wish my sister P . had you in a land flowing with milk and potatoes -- If she be a truth telling Woman she loves and esteems you , I wo n't repeat her expreſsions as ( Tho I enjoy flattery I am too conscientious to admenester doses to those who are better Physicians than I can pretend to be ) -- If I was to meet you at the end of three months I should stipulate by the watch for so many minutes or hours , and purge our true tongues with something equipollent as a linguist to Euphrasie and yew as an occulist -- “ for we have much to say ” Source not yet traced . -- I have looked into your letter since beginning this Morceau , and you may believe , am not only highly entertained by the manner but delighted with the matter -- often when the glooms pay me a short visit , I reflect that I poſseſs the friendship of such and such , which consoles and refocillates me in a considerable degree -- take my word you have many a long letter ( If we live ) to expect from me , and as to arrangement , direction , and sentiment , that jargonic misapplyed and prostituted expreſsion you may search and research , Shakespear has something , touching two grains of wheat in a bushell of Chaff William Shakespeare , The Merchant of Venice I.i.115 -- You would in earnest love me if you were intimate with those I love -- I am full of them at this distance , yet my Religion forbids me to repine at the improbability of seeing them -- now in this stage of the busyneſs what have I told you ? What a dull mortal not to tell you of lemons and Whales , of rocks and Women , Ships and Caverns , Thunder and rain , potatoes and ducks , and how I am about being marryed to a young flaunting Jade with black eyes and white teeth , or a fair complexion blue eyes and good nature -- in true truth , when I see a friend after a certain lapse of time I find my thoughts as distracted as poor Martha 's were who wanted one thing needful -- all abroad , all talk , in short -- & ca You must know that if ever I should have the pleasant fortune of seeing you so happily fixed as I believe you are , I shall have no reserve whatever , but indulge in an overflow of that precious folly which you have experienced more or leſs from some of your maiden namesakes -- pray take the pains of correcting this fátras -- If I can find time I will write you a few lines in the envelope , bearing a distant resemblance to common sense and coheerence ( if I can ) -- my best friends were good enough to overlook the sulky humor I was poſseſsed by when last in England -- The reasons for which might be very unreasonable , but I will tell all over a seacoal fire either in this World or Postscript -- your Husband is a curious fellow to be in love with his Wife , I see he is , and I could be a little bit in love with you myself , only I happen to be engaged -- Now good Dear pretty Mrs : D . will you make an Apology for me ? that I should send you a most lame and impotent preface instead of a narrative with beginning middle and end , with some lardings of compliment and never ending aſsurances of attachment and those sort of things , is certainly flying in the face of gratitude decorum and Gentilhommerie , but hear me I was this day up before the Sun , heavy as a leaden dormouse The Nonpareille having come to an anchor last night has hurried us so that I can scarce say my life is my own -- however when Marshal Villars was in the Cevennes depopulating the Country by the exte rmination of the Huguenots he learned the fatal event of the Batt le Marshall writes to his Monarch the Superb Louis disgrace befallen the arms of France and the ind brought on the fleurs de Lys , deplores his own misfortune w hic h forbid his being present “ autrement & ca ” Mais je ne puis pas me trouver pas tout -- Mr D . pacify , or endeavor to pacify the lady s just indignation , and on my part aſsure her that when I think on absent friends whom I value esteem and like , I can not but lament with Villars -- kiſs the little Louisa and her cadet for me , and accept my sincere aſsurances of friendly regard -- If you knew how grateful I feel for your unsollicited remembrance you would determine to retain hopes of my amendment . 2 d Postscript per the Fanny -- tell of a broil preparing for the Kings birth day tomorrow 1790 .
