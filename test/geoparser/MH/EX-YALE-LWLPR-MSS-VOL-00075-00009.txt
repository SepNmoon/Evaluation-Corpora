St James 's Place Friday Morning This is the first day , I cou 'd sincerely boast of an amendment , or my Dear agreable Miſs Hamilton s commands wou 'd have been sooner obey 'd -- they were too flattering for me to neglect . I have been a poor Languid mortal since I saw you , but instead of smelling to my bottle of salts & c. I took a look at my charming Locket ; recollected the honours my heart most gratefully feels and also abounds with every warm wish for the Health & true felicity of yr Royal Mistreſs so amiable ! that tis impoſsible not to Love her ; you are an Enviable creature -- but as you are worthy of the honour of seeing her every Day , I will not ( if I can help it ) envy you but wish you many years enjoyment of that & every Earthly Felicity Affectly . Yrs MDelany The Dſs of Portland s cold much better , & that makes me better . To Miſs Hamilton at the Queens Lodge Windsor Mrs Delany 5 th Janry . 1781
