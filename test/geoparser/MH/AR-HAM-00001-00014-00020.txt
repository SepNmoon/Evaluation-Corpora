You will easily imagine how much I wish to return , & I will not give up all hopes , thank God the Dear Children are quite well , & it is to be washed all over again to night therefore it appears to me impoſsible that there can be any infection left , nor will any thing convince me to the contrary but as I am not to decide it is of little consequence , th eir Spirits are beyond what you can imagine , & I do aſsure you that I am surprised that I am not quite distracted , for they never leave me from ½ pt 7 in the Morg till they go to Bed at night except the hour I am at Dinner . My Dr have God Bleſs you , do not exert yr self too much , be aſsured that every body is convinced that you g d o beyond what yr Strength will allow believe me very faithfuly yr Affect MCG -- the Children desire their Love , I scarcely know what I write they make such an inceſsant Noi se pt Seven A thousand thanks for all the good thing s you sent --
