Recd . 12 th . Novbr . 1779 Friday Morg.ng 9 o'clock My Dearest dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , my Friend , The éclairciſsement you wished for paſsed to day between my # # & me , I merely related ye . plain state of ye . case , without defending myself in ye least , justice shewed herself so clearly on my side yt . nothing more cld .. be said upon ye . subject , & # # has again aſsumed her # # engaging manners with me . O my Queen Charlotte I am delighted with Julia as far as I am come & I love her ye . more as I represent her to myſelf as my Miranda , she cost me many tears last Night about ye . death of her Mother , as you did my friend in ye . commencement of this Summer , bu enough upon yt . subject , let me never think any thing more about it as you have set my mind quite at rest about it . How cld .. my dearest friend ask as a favor of me to read any thing which she recommends , is not it doing me a favor to recommend any thing of yt . sort or of any sort to me , but such sentences are synonimous with ye . term gracious wh .. my darling Sister knows I have a mortal aversion to , but all this proceeds from a little spice of méchanceté . I am unfortunate enough not to have Miranda 's Collection of Poems with me here , nor do I know any body also here from whom I cld .. borrow ym.- I must therefore delay for a Week reading yt . Poem until I arrive in Town where I have ye . whole set . Again how cld .. you suppose I meant it as a reproach when I said yt . you had marked every beautiful paſsage my ſelf & yt . therefore my marking was needleſs , continue my Dodsley to do so , & by doing so you will teach me to remark many beautiful paſsages wh .. else in my inattentive manner of reading I shd .. easily let slip . Pardon my dearest friend my complaining of these little infractions upon our treaty of friendship I can not so much call ym- infractions as deviations from it . As to what you say mention in yr . Letter my Miranda yt . I never shall lose a friend in you , believe me when I say yt . there is nobody upon Earth for whom you are dearer , or so dear as to me , yt . my whole existence is in you , & yt . as long as life rema ins in my fragil frame , you never shall want a sincere Friend & a n aff tender Brother , in Yr . ever sincerely affectionate Miranda toujours de même P.S . Pray pardon ye . briefneſs of this Letter , as I have had but one of my Gentlemen at home ye whole Day & it wld .. have been ill breeding to have left him alone , as my figetting dear B—— is seldom in ye . Room . Pray also pardon ye inaccuracies of this Letter as it is past 12 & my eyes are almost closed with sleep . You shall have a longer tho ' I can not promise very entertaining Letter on Su——y . I suppose you mean to begin to shew me how well you intend to keep yr . promise of banishing all melancholy ideas as well as is in yr . power out of yr . mind , by sealing yr . Letters with black Wax . ( A remark from ye . tips of ye . ears ) Ad . Ad . Ad . trés trés trés chére Amie , soyez persuadée que vous m'êtes toujours chere . Hey ho ! Votre Palemon
