London December 28 th : My dear Mrs : Dickenson -- Mr : Greville din 'd here last Friday , and deliver 'd your Letter to me . I am very glad to hear you are as well as poſsible -- indeed , I have lately , had very good accounts of you , from your friend , Miſs Anne Clarke . Mrs : and Miſs Glover are come to Town for the Winter -- I have seen them -- they are both well . I was too young when I was in Ireland , to have any acquaintance with Mrs : Preston -- We have the pleasure of knowing , and seeing frequently , her Brother , Governor Hamilton . Our House is cover 'd in , which is a good thing , for I suppose , we may now expect frequent falls of Snow -- We like this Situation better and better , every Day -- it is certainly , a delightful one . I remember you enquir 'd after Mrs : Walkinshaw in your last Letter but one -- I saw her the other Day -- she was very well , and remarkably cheerful , and agreeable . I saw the Dowager Lady Warwick , lately -- she too , is very well . I intend to get a Frank for this Letter , from Mr : Greville , whom I expect to see to-morrow -- I wish you were here , for we are to have a pleasant Music-Party , tomorrow Evening -- I think you wou 'd like it . I had a Letter from my Sister , a little while ago -- she and her Children were very well . I hope Mr : Dickenson has receiv 'd benefit from the Bath Waters , which I conclude , he began drinking , soon after he got to Bath . Do n't you think Bath a very pretty Place ? I remember thinking it so ; and I have heard , that it is much improved , since I left it . My sweet friend , Mrs : Siddons , is quite well -- she has just got over the anxiety of the Small-Pox with her youngest Child -- she chose to inoculate him thus young , and I think she was perfectly right , for the sooner the Small-Pox is got over , the better -- I have had the pleasure of seeing her perform , only twice this Season , as yet -- In Belvidera , in the Tragedy of Venice preserv 'd , and in Hermione , in that of The Distreſs 'd Mother -- it is unneceſsary to say , she is as enchanting as ever . My Brother is so grown , that , were you to see him , you wou 'd hardly know him -- I never saw him better than he is at present -- and he improves very much , in every respect . We see him a great deal oftener , than we did , when we liv 'd in Bedford Square , we are so considerably nearer to him . Lord and Lady Warwick are not yet come to Town , but I hear they are to come . -- Lady Stormont is to be with us to-morrow , and is to bring William Murray with her , who is at home , for the Christmas Holydays -- he is quite pleas 'd with the Idea of coming here -- you know , it is always a great event to Children , to come out of an Evening . So you heard of my speaking Italian -- I speak it now , with great facility , I have so much practice -- I have left off taking Leſsons in it . I lately , saw , a Lady , who made many Enquiries after you -- Mrs : Turton -- I met her one Evening , at a Party that I was at . Tho , it is a very trite thing , I can not write to you at this Season , without making you and Mr : Dickenson , the Compliments of it -- I wish you , very many , and happy , returns of it . My Father and Mother beg to be remember 'd kindly to you . My Mother says , she is quite happy that you are to be under the care of Mr. Randall , for that he has been for a long time , the most Pe eminent Person in his busineſs , in Bath . My Father and Mother beg to be very particularly remember 'd to Mrs : Preston -- she is a great favourite with them . Adieu , dear Mrs : Dickenson , I am yours sincerely -- J : Hamilton . We all beg kind Compts : to Mr : Dickenson . Miſs Hamilton Decbr . 1786
