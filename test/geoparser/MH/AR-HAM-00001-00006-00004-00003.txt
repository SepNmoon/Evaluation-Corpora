Dear Madam Oct 28 th I had been murmuring at my cold , ever since you left Sandleford , for having deprived me of an hour or two of yours & Mr Dickenson s company till this morning brought me the best amends for my loſs , the favour of your obliging letter . My churlish cold kept me in bed the day you departed , by which I also lost the pleasure of seeing the Bishop of Salisbury & Mrs Barrington , who had the goodneſs to call for an hour in their way to Mongewell . After three or four days confinement I am now well enough to take the air in my chaise , & in some shelterd place to get a walk . These little excursions are very delightfull at all seasons of the year , but particularly at this . The Seasons have all performd their labours , & all things seem subsiding into gentle peace , & sweet tranquillity , & the Robin red breast chaunts the Vespers of the year . My time of life , now falling into the sere & yellow leaf Shakespeare , Macbeth V.iii , perhaps makes me sympathise more with the tranquillity of Autumn , than the gayity of Spring , & the gaudy pomp , & splender of summer , & its bustling labours . I hope my dear Madam your & Mr Dickenson s next visit to Sandleford will not be so short , & my Grandson Edward will in another year pay due homage to the rosy cheeks & dimpled smile of pretty Miſs Dickenson . His Parents beg you to accept to present their best respects , & present them to Mr Dickenson , to whom I hope you will offer mine , & so give ye little Lady s rosy cheek a kiſs for me . My cold has left such a weakneſs in my eyes , as fortunately for you , prevents my troubling you with a longer letter . With sincere esteem I am Dear Madam your most affectionate & Obliged Humble Servant Eliz Montagu May I take the liberty to desire my best compts to Lady Wake ? Newbury .
