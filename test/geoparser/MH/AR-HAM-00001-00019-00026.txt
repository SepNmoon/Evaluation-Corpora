Canterbury Decr , 27 th 1772 I was favored with my dearest Mary letter of the 24 th instant last night & you may be ſure of pardon or any thing else you can deſire of me , & in my power to grant , tho I can not help ſaying and hoping that for the future my dear Girl will take a little more time before she judges between herself & my affection for her , but I shall ſay no more of it , as her own letter has ſaid more than I should ever have ſaid had she not made no conceſsions at all -- I thank God I am at present quite well & in spirits & hope with care to continue so for the winter & shall take particular care of my health ſince you are so very obliging My dear Girl to ſay that you are concerned in it and shd- obey you in writing many sheets had not the Doctor ordered me neither to write or read long at a time and as I am always so impatient to anſwer yours I am afraid my letters can not be so long as I wish , tho I must own I seldom know when to give over when I am writing to you , it gives me so much real pleasure . The agreeable Widow Barrington happens to be Aunt to the amiable & agreeable Mr Price so I make no doubt but Miſs Hamilton does & might hear of her , but my dear Girl is rather out about the elegant Suppers she gives Col Napier as I can aſsure you he never in his life supped with Mrs Barrington but once & that is above two months ago before the Seventh Regiment of Drags- was quartered in Northampton otherwise I might have mentioned it to you after I had known you had ſeen Capt- Price but entre nous I dont believe I am much of a favorite with the widow and was it not for Cards I believe I should have the happineſs to be but very seldom in her Company . I am so very well acquainted with almost every body here that we meet in almost every house she goes too & you know of Course I fill up a vacancy at a Card table just as well as another so com̅only have an invitation to her card party 's which when not otherwise engaged I always go too , as I think the widow of a General Officer has a right to demand Civility 's from every Officer in the army I am my dear Girl extremely obliged to your friend Mrs- Rogers for her meſsage in yours but I either am quite stupid or have loſsed lost my memory as I am totally unacquainted with the Lady by that name but suppose her being your friend that she has ſome little regard for me being certain no body can have have more friendship for you than I have as thro that Channel I have a right to claim ſome little regard from her as your friend . O my dearest Girl & beg Mrs Rogers a thouſand pardons I 've just recollected your next door Neighbour please return my best respects to her with the Compts- of the Seaſon & tell her I must love every body that is a friend to my dearest Mary Mr A is a minor Cannon , not a Prebend in this Church I am not acquainted with him tho I have ſeen at Mrs Barrington s two of his Daughters one about Sixteen ye other fifteen as near as I could gueſs from once seeing them . I really am extremely concerned for the Kitten to whom I beg my best wishes may be acceptable I agree with you that the perscreption ſeems to be an odd one tho they should know best & if I recollect you once huffed me for hinting that Love may be the Cause of her mourning as the ſong says , but from the Phiſician s perscription I must still keep my opinion tho its not in ye least neceſsary to hint my suspicions to her as few young Lady 's likes to have those things known -- I know Mr- Egerton 's family & c but have no acquaintance with him in the least . But you are my dearest Mary quite right to put confidence in me & be aſsured I never will make a bad use of it , so I beg you 'll always open your heart freely to me & believe me you have not a greater friend lives or one that has your happineſs more at heart than I have I am glad you are to have no disturbance at your election , am very glad the Brawn was good , you see I shew you that I run from one thing to another its the best way between friends as by that one ſees that they do not study for things to fill up letters , as those are always dry & inſipid that dont come at once with out much thinking adieu for ſome time my Dearest Girl as I am obliged to give over but hope to make this long , if not take the will for deed but always believe that I am most faithfully & affctly Yours & c Monday 28 th two o'Clock in the morning I have my dearest Mary been writing ſince ten o'Clock upon buſineſs but will if I can poſsible write out this sheet to you to shew you that my greatest -- happineſs & Pleaſure is to obey you in every thing in my Power nor am I afraid to ſay that I indulge myself with pleaſure to think that my dear Girl has ſome pleaſure in writing to you . me . I met Mrs- Barrington to night & told her that I had the pleaſure of hearing from Northampton that her Nephew was well pray says she what Correspondence have you there as I have heard you ſay that you had none in ye Regt . , that is true Madam ſays I , but I have a young Lady there that I call my Daughter and my ward who is so good as I believe to look upon me as one of her best friends , but Madam I can aſsure you she is not a Northampton Lady but a relation of mine who lives there , and one I have a most particular regard for . so there my dear the converſation dropt but only said she hoped her Nephew knew you as from what I ſaid she was certain you must be an agreeable acquaintance -- I did not think the last ought to be anſwered by any thing else but a low Bow which I certainly made so we went to another subject . as I shall do now , by beging you to remember my best Compts- to your Mama and that I am extremely obliged to her for her kind concerns about my health & that I am happy that hers is so much better for which reaſon I hope to have longer letters from you Pray my Good Girl think when you ſay that you are always in a hurry and that you have little time to spare by being obliged to write yr Mama 's letters think then what I have to write yt most days & nights I am to this hour seldom in bed by being obliged to write so many letters on Regimental buſineſs & likeways to a numerous Correspondence among relations -- I never heard of Miſs Cathcart going as a Maid of Honor , nor do I believe it tho its difficult to ſay what may happen but I know nothing of it I can aſsure you but if I hear any thing for certain you shall be made acquainted with it , I hope you write ſome times to yr Uncle if you do not I beg you may as I think it proper and as my daughter & ward I order you to do it , & I know you too dutifull to disobey me tho I am afraid you have more com̅and over me than I have over you , witneſs the length of this letter , at this Hour and in my situation Adieu my dearest dearest Mary believe me yours most unchangable & Affctly WmNapier Goodnight or rather Good morning , past three o'Clock & a frosty morning and I most sleepy adieu once more My dearest Girl To Miſs Hamilton Northamptonshire 9 th 10 th - J Free Sawbridge
