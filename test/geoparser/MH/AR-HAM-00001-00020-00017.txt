Edinr- 26 April 1779 The night before last an immense packet arrived , directed to Miſs Napier . My Eldest Sister having taken unto herself a helpmate & gone to Dumfries , & Harriot being in the Country , I had the presumption to break open the Seals , but how great was my surprise when out dropt a Lockit , a Book , a Note for Miſs Napier & a large paper directed for me ? I rung the Bell & the Servants aſsured me they did not know where the packet came from , as it was brought by a Porter . I then made bold to open the paper directed to myself , which inclosed a most beautiful purse which I suppose came from You , if not , I have given you credit for a peice of work universally admired & wait with impatience till Mrs- Hunter in course of Post writes me something Tendant ou dénouëment . The Writing upon the different covers , appears to be yours , tho ' I can hardly imagine you would treat me so cavaleirly , when I consider that this is the third letter I have wrote to you without obtaining an answer . If the purse is of your fabricating , I return you a million of thanks for it & shall preserve it among the small collection of my Valuables . The book I presume belongs to Mrs- Hunter & shall send it to her by the first opportunity ; the Lockit I have retained 'till she informs me what is to be done with it . I have given over all thoughts of seeing you this Summer . I before told you of my disappointment , & people above are now almost as little remembered by me as I seem to be by them . My military Ideas have for some time been at rest , and I find myself happy in being well received by some few friends whom who I esteem , & who profeſs a regard for me . This week brings about a Marriage between two of those , for whom I entertain the most sincere freindship Ly . Sophia Hope ( a Cousin German of my father s tho ' younger than myself ) has consented to give her hand & heart next friday to Lord Binning , oldest Son to Ld . Hadinton & a near relation of mine . They are the most amiable pair I ever knew & even the busy public appear to be happy at the thoughts of their future felicity . Adieu . When you have leisure , pray let me hear from you . How does the good Lord Dartrey ? Miſs K. Clarke ? The little Baronet ? & our Cousin of Stormont ? I approve of the Letter to the Ducheſs of D . and remain sincerely Your Affect . Friend N—— .
