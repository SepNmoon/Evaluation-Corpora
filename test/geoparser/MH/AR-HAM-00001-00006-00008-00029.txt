Vous cultivez votre Jardin , Mademoiſelle ; permettez que je cultive le mien . -- You employ 'd your ſelf yesterday , I ſuppoſe , in improving your Mind at the Fireſide . I was busied in ſtrengthening my Body . I dug two hours in Mr : Kerr 's Garden yesterday morning ; -- Why wo n't you let this be my Day of reſt ? -- But I 'll proſecute Mr : Wye for Scandalum magnatum . -- I was out of my Bed when your ſervant came , tho ' he return 'd for Anſwer -- I was not up . -- I 'll write no more to the Coll : for ſome time ; -- you may tell him I drop the Subject ( to ſave myself ſome writing ) for I perceive he is reſolved to have the laſt Word . -- In caſe you ſhould be prevented from going to Church , the Inclosed may ſerve as a Text for your ſerious Meditations
