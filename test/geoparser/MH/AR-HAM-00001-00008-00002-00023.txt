Audley End Janry 26 th My dearest Mrs Dickenson I will not suffer Lord Braybrooke to leave this place again to attend Parliamt without getting a direction for you -- I have been impatient to thank you over & over again for yr kindneſs to me -- I was well aware of the magnitude of the favor I ask 'd . well knowing how unpleasant it is to an honest , th ' o a Vulgar mind , to be implicated in other peoples Affairs -- how much more so to a mind like yours , not my only with high Principles of Honour -- but with Polish 'd manners . all I can add is , that you may trust me safely -- I have not committed you in the smallest degree -- I wrote my Sister , exactly the Censure that Baily sent me , first as to the information I wrote him respecting my Letter I wrote to my Sister -- acquainting her with part of the busineſs -- which I should thi nk was Sufficient to Alarm any one who is not determin 'd to shut her Eyes & Ears to Conviction . I trust it has done so -- she has wrote a tolerably Spirited Letter to Stevens -- she had not received an Answer last Friday -- perhaps she may not answer it at all -- but upon that Answer depends my return to Wing -- I shall therefore think my self very much obliged to you & Mr Dickenson if you wd Enquire -- if a Lodging could be procur 'd in the Neighborhood of the Lodge -- I have received a very Civil Answer from Major Gilpin -- who promises to put order the Painting , ( they have the longest traces & the most dangerous behind them ) immediately -- I have wrote my Sister word , that however my Conduct may have been thought strict respecting the keeping or discharging my Servant . I did not think I ought to suffer such Vermin as Virgin & his daughter to tell me I was a fool -- or to sneer at me -- that Anne was now under my Protection , & til I could ensure Peace to my self & my Servants I would not return . if by Chance . Mr D : or you sd see Baily ask him if they have given up the thoughts of disposing of Anne . they have had Sister upon a Visit from Steven 's -- she however wrote Anne a very kind letter almost mocking the Subject of her late folly -- I am truly happy if my Turkey was Either pleasure or Service to you -- Miſs Fisherson was long prepar 'd for the loſs of her Servant , & she marries with the Approbation of her Mistreſs -- & of his Master -- What Times these are -- my dear Mrs D : Lord Braybrooke does not say much -- & hear by a little Gangche Gauche that people in London are rather disatisfied -- & that the t are not very happy -- & as a proof , Lord Buckingham goes this year to paſs the Parliamentary Season in PallMall , to keep a Steady watch I conclude . They talk of a new Supplementary Militia , after having reduc 'd the regular Milit i a . I find that the Opposition are making a Stir -- for Grey also is the declar 'd Head of that Party -- as a kind of Shop ( my frd stil 'd it ) at the Thatch 'd House . there is no Cockpit this Eveg . Grey made the Amendment -- God send all honest Men to succeed in getting us Peace -- I have had the most lively pleasant Letter from our dear Mrs Carter that can be conceived -- do you know she came from Deal by Night in the Mail Coach . her friends all remonstrated , but she laugh 'd at them all . I wrote her that I hoped she would be able to repeat this several Times . but Ly Nelthorpe writes word that she saw Mrs Carter at Chaple -- & thought she look 'd sadly -- she & I are Engaged in a warm dispute , ( an Amiable one ) she will not believe that Buonaparte will restore the K : of France -- I do sincerely believe it . Mrs Peachy was so good to send me a Letter for the dear Emigrant Count Sulé who is in the highest Spirits -- he is sure the K of France will be upon the Throne in leſs than Six Months -- but he thinks that Buonaparte will be King of Lombardy , take Mantua , Peschiare , the Piedmontese all to Tuscany & that side the Alps -- I say -- No -- if he has real Great Ambition , he will restore the Monarchy -- make them a rational free Government . he has already aggrandis 'd France . & then retire into private Life -- with a name far Super ior to one who made the World turn pale . to point a Moral , or adorn a tale -- he will not only have saved France , but Europe , for if he could go on in his Consulate , after having made such a change in one year -- what Nation wd Suffer a generation of Monarchs -- Count Sulé writes , that Buonaparte had sent an Ambaſsador to Petersburgh & that Paul sent one from himself to Britain to Louis 18 , & has received one from Louis ye 18 -- he adds that 25 French Emigrants are to go to Calais the day after he sent that letter . he will not go til the king is upon the Throne -- the Chatter is that the K : has facilitated the match between Col Erskine & Lady Louisa Paget by making the Col : an Aid de Camp . & his quickneſs in getting rid of Lady H——n . by getting the Q : of Naples letter for yr Uncle is much applauded . for a Letter from one Queen to another was not to be Trifled with . he had heard of this Letter , & at ye Interview which is Customary upon the return of a foreign Minister he saw yr Uncle put his hand into his Waistcoat pocket , he immediately Enquir 'd after the Q : of Naples . & then Sir W : told his Majesty that his Wife was commiſsion 'd to give a letter to her Majesty The K instantly said , have you got the letter , I 'll give it to the Queen your Uncle gave the Letter -- et en resta la -- poor dear Mrs Jalabert is far from well . we are all Uneasy about her . Lord B . very much so -- but we dare not tell her . she sends her Compliments to you -- Miſs Neville s Philadelphia goes on very well . we were a little alarm 'd . for 16 is rather a dangerous age -- but we have now great hopes that she will be Establish 'd in her principles Sufficiently to enable her to be a hard working farmers Servant in about a year . She has given proofs this morning , that divine Truths have made some impreſsions on her mind -- Adieu my dear Mrs Dickenson give my kind love to Mr Dickenson & the dear Lsa -- I really believe a more upright , Steady-Spirited Man does not exist than Baily -- I trust in God that my Sister will be as I believe she is . truly sensible of his Merits -- she is really one of the best of Women . her merit is indeed exalted , & I am proud to think it so -- but she was sure to be the dupe of Wicked people . & she has too tenacious a Opinion of her own Abilities -- but when once convinc 'd no one more ready to acknowledge an Error -- th ' o God only know what it costs her in the mortification of having been so Groſsly abus 'd -- direct under Cover to Lord Braybrooke & thank you for two letters which I duly received -- What a sad cold morning for Lady L s breakfast I thought of Mr D : when I went in the Whisky this morng it was dreadfully cold -- once more Adieu & believe me most truly & Affcly yrs DBloſset .
