Sir , I call 'd this morning upon Mr Dickenson and was informed that she proposed to set out tomorrow morning to accompany Miſs Hamilton & Lord on a tour to Devon Shire , & that they were not to return to London sooner than a month at least . I confeſs I coud not help expreſsing my surprize to Lady Dartrey , whom I supposed to be engaged in attentions naturally belonging to her future plan , that she shou 'd have leisure for such a seemingly ill timed excursion . I thought myself authorised to be a little minute in my enquiries and am very sorry to say I receiv 'd very little satisfaction in her answers . It came out , that she agreed to this expedition in compliance with the advice of some of her Friends , who hoped she might receive benefit by it , as it is visible her health has been affected by the agitation and anxiety of mind she has suffer 'd for some time past . My decided opinion to her was , that as long as the cause subsisted , her anxiety wou 'd accompany her where ever she went , & that I wou 'd by all means recommend it to her to decline taking any step that might , however unjustly , throw unfavourable insinuations upon your conduct . Relying upon the sincerity of my advice , she went immediately to make her excuses to Miſs Hamilton & Ld . . If you shou 'd think that I have acted with any judgement , you will I hope be the leſs startled at my presuming to offer you my advice tho ' unasked . As a Friend to Ly . Dartrey I can not help feeling very sensibly , that the circumstances of her engagement to you have led her into very mortifying & perplexing situations ; these I will allow may hitherto have been unavoidable ; but I can not easily suppose that the continuation of them shou 'd be so likewise . I think Sir , it is really incumbent upon you to come to Town immediately ; by so doing many disagreeable surmises wou 'd be annihilated ; you wou 'd at the same time have an opportunity of conversing with some of Miſs Hamilton s Friends , who might possibly be of use when they understand circumstances they ought to know , but which they are yet strangers to . I am very far from wishing to pry into other Persons affairs , but the busineſs in question can not be transacted without a mutual confidence . As I propose to leave London the first week in June , & to be absent about five months , it wou 'd be a great satisfaction to me to be of some use in this busineſs before I set out ; I therefore flatter myself that you will not find it inconvenient to comply with my request , by which you wou 'd afford the greatest satisfaction to one who merits every attention in your power , and give me an opportunity at the same time of demonstrating the regard with which I remain Sir , Your faithful Humble Servt .
