71 , Queen Street 10 th - June 1808 My Dear Sister , Be comforted . People come to your Time of Life , having the Gout for the first Time , never have it very severely . I rejoice , however , that it has paid You a Visit ; as You will now know how to feel for your Friends , when You see them in Lambs Wool Stockings , and Cloth Shoes . I expected , that the want of Exercise , added to the increased Quantity of Meat and Drink , which I unavoidably swallow during the General Assembly , might have induced the Gout to have paid me a Visit . It has , most kindly been pleased to spare me , and I trust will continue to do so , as I propose going to Miſs D 's next Week . That Lord Haddington has been presented , I think perfectly right , and had her Gouty Mother gone with her , I should have been better pleased . If Louisa should accidentally see You , her next Speech to the Queen will be “ You are not so broad as Your “ Mother -- ” I have not the least doubt that the Princeſses eyed her from head to foot , and , if the could , would have found fault with her . They dont seem to have said anything kind of You , or to have sent any kind Meſsage to You . I dont approve of this . They ought to have pretended at least , to be interested about You . As for old Louisa , She is certainly smitten with Cis . Mr. Dickenson , perhaps , may have imbibed the same tender paſsion , & therefore , for your Peace of Mind , avoids your Company . I have not the least doubt , that her Ladyship was so intent on her Cards , at Lady Clavering 's party , the she knew not either Lady Cis , or your Daughter was in the Room . Mr. Dickenson , makes a Tour of the Cumberland Lakes before She arrives at Lanrick Castle . ( By the bye , that same place ought to have been mine , had not my Grandfather s imprudence sent it into the Market ) . I think of going there in the course of the Summer . Lady Eliz . Macgregor Murray has built a good house on the property since he purchased it . I do not think Sir John M. Murray healthy , and should not be surprised , to see her Ladyship a Young Widow . Having written that much to You ; it is proper , that the remainder of this Sheet of Paper should be addreſsed to your Husband , who is certainly your better half , for I will be bound , he could not have persuaded You to have finished a Letter for him . So , Adieu . My Dear Sir , Should it be publickly known that You took up the Pen to finish your Wife 's Letter , when She chose to go a Gadding , all our Wives would rise in Rebellion , and attempt to make Jerries of Us all . But , I protest against your continuing to indulge her , in any of her unreasonable fancies . The accounts from Manchester are very unpleasant indeed . No sooner , did the news reach Edinburgh than the Devils immediately circulated the Report of similar Riots at Glasgow . That there are people wicked enough to wish for such disturbances , both in England & Scotland , I firmly believe . But , I trust , there is still left so large a portion of good Sense , in the bulk of the People , that the Demons will not succeed in creating that Confusion they aim at . Our Manufacturers have remained very quiet , and I hope will continue to do so . I am really glad that our Cousins have behaved properly , & that Captain Murray has seen the Queen . Louisa owes her some kindneſs , for the Torment her Mother had , in her Service . I wish she had graciously condescended , at least , to have expreſsed her approbation of Her Majesty I wish I had been of the Presentation Party , that I might have fixed my Eye on Mrs- D . & poſsibly have brought back to her recollection , the manner , in which , She used to talk to Me , about the Q . Adieu , My Dear Sir . With best love from all here to You & Yours , I ever am , Your faithful humble Servant Mrs- D .
