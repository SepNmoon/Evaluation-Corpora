May 19 1807 My Dearest Love A friend has procur 'd for me an aperture for sending to Engd : but has confin 'd me to a few lines to avoid bulk ; & as I am certain that even two words from me will be acceptable to so affectionate a sister , I must endeavour to say as much as I can in so limited a space You may easily imagine how much I was afflicted with the interruption of our correspondence ; particularly on your account ; as I flatter myself that you all remain happily in the same state , but I am uncertain you wou 'd be miserably anxious for me , as my last letter , if you have read it , with one also for my Dearest Father , written in the month of Augt , tho ' I did not fully explain the deplorable state of health I was in , was nevertheleſs rather alarming . I have endeavour 'd to console myself with the hope that Mr : Timmins might have perform 'd his promise of making you a visit which wou 'd confort you in some degree to see one who cou 'd give you an acct : of yr Elizabeth , & her children . The providential supply wch . my belov 'd Parent sent to restore my spirits , was perhaps the means with the bleſsing of God , to preserve my life , as it enabled me to go into the country , where I underwent a course of medicines , which purified my blood in some degree , & served to keep me alive for the winter . I had such a horror of returning to Naples that I fortunately took a house in the town near the Casino , which is very warm ; & where I have been able to paſs the rigours of a most cold , wet , confortleſs winter . I shall go down to the Casino again , which is the only place wherein I can enjoy tollerable health , as the air of the sea is so neceſsary to my existence . I must not omit to tell you that I have lately recd . the box of medicines & c safe , which tho ' they have made me pay very dear for them at the custom house at Rome , rejoiced my heart in procuring me the pleasure of reading your dear letter , & those of my two Friends ' just a year after their date . Good Mrs : Robinson 's & Miſs Sydall s ' presents were highly acceptable , & I beg you will say every thing kind to them in return , which you can better imagine . Then I have room here to explain : the case of goods is yet at Meſsina , but I go on as well as I can . All the world suffers , & we must be content with what pleases God . I believe I mention 'd in my letter my wish that the twenty pounds which I had drawn for , might be made up by the interest so as to adjust the sum in Mr : R 's hands . I dont know if there can be any means of sending me anything there might be over & above . I hope you all remain well including all my Brother 's family . Pray remember me gratefully to Mrs Ainsworth & to all my Friends who are so kind to think of yr most affect Elizabeth E Palombi to Miss Sarah Dickenson 19 May 1807 .
