My dear Friend ! How fare you & your dear little Louisa I think it an age since I have seen you , indeed it is very long since last Thursday & then you only staid a minute come & breakfast with me tomorrow morning , I shall go to Chapel & walk till 9 & then breakfast you had bette r do so too , or if that is too early come at 9 -- if you are engaged tomorrow , come Friday & spend the mor n i n g with me , I want to see you in comfort & have never don e it but when you have been occupied & anxious -- I have not recovered Ld Henry 's vararies last night , about whi ch I feel too much to say anything , he is infinitly beyond praise & encomiun -- adieu my dear -- my Father returns Friday , I believe we shall go with him to Harrowgate in a fortnight -- ever your affce : C. M. Gunning Wednesday antient M . Music to night 7 th . May 1788 London Mrs Dickenson s
