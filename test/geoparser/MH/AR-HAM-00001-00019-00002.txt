Boston August 26 th 1768 I hope my Dear Miſs Hamilton will do me the Justice to bellieve it will always give me pleasure to hear from her -- & that I could only regreate receiveing a Letter from you instead of yr Mamma because the reason of yr being employ 'd was so disagreeable a one to her & of course to You -- asure her we are extreamly Sorry she has been so much Indisposed but hope the Rhumatism has left her long beffore this can reach You & heartily wish yr next may bring more Comfortable accounts of both her & Mr Hamilton -- whose Goutish Complaints Mr Napier sympathizes with ; in a double Capacity being still far from free from them himself I should have told you all this sooner but am far from being well myself & often so much distrest that I 'm quite incap a ble to hold a Pen -- I write with pain now , but do it : in hopes of being entitled to Speedy good Acts : of You all as You Young Lady 's are not Lyable to the same Interuptions of correspondance we married ones often meet with . I likewise want to tell You I have had information that half a fine Buck is on its way from Risby to Northampton -- a present to Us so beg yr Pappa will look out sharp for it -- & eat it to our Healths 'twould be a thousand pity 's to have it lost had we been there we would have eat it together -- as it is it will be great Comfort to Us to know that you had wt we imagine is very good of its kind -- . We still hope to be with You about the midle of Octr : I therefore hope when yr Pappa sees Mr Samuel he 'll tell him so & yt the Moment the route arrives I shall sett out for his House where I hope to find every thing read y for our Reception -- at the same time it wont be so ; if the people here can prevent it or keep us amongst them -- so you see how litle certainty falls to the Lott of us Millitary People -- one thing however is certain that we shall ever esteem ourselves Happy in an Oportunity of being in yr Neighbourhood -- as for other things we have no cause to regreate yr Babylonians nothing can be more Civill or Sociable than the people here -- 't is one constant round of Invitations for us & those we are most Intimate with to Partake of Venison & all good things that can be Collected together & no Vaills nor Card Money alow 'd in the County -- I shall not at all regreate finding Loo abolisht amongst You -- as its a Game I never will make one at . I 'm sorry for yr Sake yr Pappa & Mamma dont mean to be at the Races but perhaps your party may Muster more forces by that time -- I have had no Acts of my Br but by the Pappers since he Sailled he wrote me from London he was to write to Mr Hamilton beffore he sett out . Mr Napier joins yr Cousins & me in best compts : to You yr Pappa & Mam ma & I am Ever Dear Miſs Hamilton Most faithfully Yours & c & c M A Napier . I wont make you pay double by putting this in a Cover the Venison is a present from Miſs Mostyne to whom half the Estate of Risby bellongs --
