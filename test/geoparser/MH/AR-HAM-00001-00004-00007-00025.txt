Ipswich November 12 th . 1770 . Dear Brother , I am just return 'd from London where I went to paſs a week not to be intirely forgot by the few friends I have left ; I had not been there for more than two years . I paſs 'd my time chiefly with Ld . Warwick , Ld . Greville , & Ld . Abercorn ; the two former have undertaken that I shall have no trouble about residence in Ireland & as Ld . Hillsborough is also of the party I begin to feel myself a little easier upon that subject . I receiv 'd a letter some days ago from Ldy . Warwick who is at Ghent , where she proposes to paſs the winter ; she was so far on her way to Aix la Chapelle , & being taken ill , & her disorder ending in a jaund ice which detain 'd her till the travelling season was past , she determin 'd to continue where she is till next Spring . Her house in London is coverd in , but going on slowly as it is a Great undertaking & above her abilities to push on with more expedition , it is in Queen Ann Street behind Cavendish Square . On my return here I found a letter from Ldy . Cathcart who gives a good account of herself and of all our friends at Petersburgh , she had heard lately from my Brother at Naples who has obtain 'd leave to return to England for a few months next Spring ; he is to go by Vienna on purpose to see the Emperor , who has a personal liking to him & to whom he will certainly go Ambaſsador when Ld . Stormont is weary of that Office . Mr. Patoun says my Brother is become extremely grave & that the Climate of Naples has given him a very old and yellow appearance ; I was astonish 'd at the progreſs Patoun has made in painting he has totally attach 'd himself to painting in oil colours & I saw some of his performances which were in deed excellent he is thought to understand the art of colouring as well as any man living in which he has discoverd many valuable secrets . He lives very much with Ld . Warwick who has settled 200 £ a year upon him ; had he applied himself earlier to drawing I think he wou 'd have excell 'd any Painter we have , but at present I observe defects in his pictures in that particular & chiefly in the extremities of his figures . -- Ld . Greville is a very agreeable young Man & has many excellent qualities , his figure is perfectly good as one very rarely meets with a Person better made , Charles his next Brother is expected home this month from Germany , his appearance is by no means so good , but it is allow 'd on all hands that he has a most remarkably good understanding . Robert the third Son , first Cornet in Mordaunt 's is now at Dresden & has a particular turn for military knowle d ge , he is very tall & is in every respect a very handsome & striking f igure & has excellent dispos itions so tha t Ld . Warwick thinks himself , & he really is , very fortunate in his Children I have not seen Ldy . Louisa since her marriage she was in the Country with Mr. Churchill when I was in Town , they live with L. W——k who allows them besides , 400 £ a year , w h ich is the interest of what he intends to her . I have long ago completd all my operations here , & hav e very comfortable reside nc e -- It is an age since I have he ard you , I shall be very happ y to be inform 'd that you are from the gout and that you continue to like Northamptonshire to be affectionately rememberd with me to you & Mrs. Hamilton my Niece as does also you r old acquaintance Betty turn out a fine girl , we have lately inoculated our with great succeſs . I have sent to Dublin for my desir 'd Mr. Welldone , a very t ru sty Person , to take out your of them as he has done for several years past till I can n instructions about them . -- Adieu Dear Brother Yours Frederick Hamilton To The Honble .
