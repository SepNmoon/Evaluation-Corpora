Windsor Oct : 5 . Dear Madam Having experienced so many instances of your esteem & regard , I should feel myself highly blameable , if I any longer delayed informing you of an event , which I flatter myself will give you pleasure . I have at last followed the example of several of my worthy friends , & entered into the holy estate of Matrimony . The Lady I met with at Bath at the time I saw you & Mr. Dickinson . She is a very pleasing sensible young woman , the only child of a man of large fortune in Suffolk , who like a true Miser more easily parted with his Daughter than his money . He has indeed settled his estate upon his Daughter to come to her at his death , but he would give her nothing at her marriage : But as a pleasing companion , & not interest , was my object , I did not hesitate . We were married in Devonshire about a month ago , but arrived here only on ye . 29 th . time enough to pay my duty to the Princeſs Royal on her birthday . As my Wife wishes to see some relations in Norfolk , we shall not stay here above a few days longer : we therefore receive no visits at present : I could not however deny myself the pleasure of carrying my little woman to your dear & valuable friend Mrs. Delaney , who received us with that goodneſs which so peculiarly distinguishes her . She is in tolerable health : Miſs Burney is perfectly recovered . -- Matters at the Lodge go on very smoothly . The Father & his two elder Sons are all upon good terms . No establishment talked of for the eldest Daughter : the third Daughter is perfectly restored . Miſs Gold——y is in so indifferent a state of health that she is obliged to quit her station , at least for some time . The D . of Y . has appointed General Budé his Secretary for Foreign affairs : The K . has filled up three Rooms in the Castle in a most noble style : The Cartoons of Raphael are removed from Buckingham house , & are the principal ornament : the Rooms were opened for the first time on monday with a Ball in honour of the Princess Royal . The entertainment was truly Royal : the Supper was in S t . Georges Hall . I have seen nothing of the Ladies in the lower Lodge . As at this time I have a number of Letters to write & to answer , my go d o d Mrs. Dickinson would excuse me if I break off abruptly . Have the goodneſs to present my best Comp : t o Mr. Dickinson , & beleive me Dear madam with great truth Your sincere friend & faith ful humble Servant J Fisher Mrs. Dickenson at Taxal near Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
