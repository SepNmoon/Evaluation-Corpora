Windsor Castle Sund ay Dcr 23 d My Dea rest Mrs Dickenson I red your valuable Manuscript yester day Eg , & you may depend on my following all your injunctions , I have not had Time yet to look into above two or three Pages , but those delighted me , as they will one you call my Pet , who is worthy of them -- My delayed my thanks for the Portrait was owing to my Dear Princeſs Mary having been seriosly ill , & I wished to have it in my power to write word She had seen it & was very much pleased with it , thank God She is much better , but the constant anxiety She naturally lives in , retards Her Recovery & this added to all Her unremitted attendance upon Her poor Dear Sister which had affected Her Health , yet prevents Her even reading and writing too much , or any of Her ocupations , which She had returned to when this illneſs began -- From what I remember of Mrs Delany I am certain the Picture is like , & the good bree ding & c was perfect , & great remains of Beauty The Queen has a Picture drawn not long before Her Death which is charming -- I can not inclose it your Portrait as I have not a Frank , I will take great care of it & you shall recive it by some safe conveyance -- I hope Miſs Dickenson is quite well , & that Mr Dickenson is now with you , and in the true Old fashioned Stile & Old fashioned Friendship most sincerly do I wish you all the Compliments of this Bleſsed Season , that you may see many Happy ones -- My Friend Miſs Gomm & Sophia will be in Town the latter end of next Week , & I hope you will meet often -- I saw your Cousin Lord Cathcart for a short Time about three Weeks ago , The only words we could speak was in going to Chapel and I believe he left Windsor very soon after -- Adieu my Dearest Mrs Dickenson Ever Your Affly MCGoldsworthy I do not believe you find my Hand writing improved Mrs Dickenson Welbeck Street London
