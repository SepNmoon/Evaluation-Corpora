Wilton Lodge , 13 th . Octr- 1789 . My Dear Sister , I would begin this Letter with a Proverb , but knowing the Indigo tint of your disposition , I am fearfull of being sent to Chesterfield for a rebuke . But , You are much satisfied with my last letter ! ! ! Three points of Admiration are not sufficient to expreſs my feelings at so uncommon a declaration , & had it not been economy , to save my paper , I should have made three dozen . I proceed to answer your Questions -- not from the dread of enraging You , for thank God your tongue can not reach me at this distance , & the lazineſs of your fingers will not allow You to write me a scold , but to prevent my having the trouble of reading the same thing over again , should you ever be tempted to epistolize me in future . In the first place ( since you dislike imprimis ) Wilton Lodge is 47 miles from Edinburgh . In the second place , I have not sold my House there . and In the third place , I am to pay £ 5100 for my purchase the eleventh day of next November , besides 6 or 700 which finishing the house will cost Me . And lastly , Harriot no longer lives with Me , for it would not do . Leaving Edinr- furnished a good reason , for a separation which must have taken place . The World know nothing of the matter , & neither party are reflected on for parting . She likes to live in Town , We like the Country . These subjects can not be fully written on , but I never would advise any man to quarter his Sister on his Wife . If they agree it is very well , but if they do not , the situation is most disagreable , to be obliged to take a part with a Wife against a Sister , or with a Sister against a Wife . Harriot now occupies the house in Edinr . I lived in , when a Bachelor , where I hope & trust she will be happy . Maria had difficult cards to play . I became very sensible , where the blame of disunion originated , & heartily rejoiced when the disjunction took place . This history is between ourselves . As to politics , I remain quiet . The diſsolution of Parliament will occasion the Horns of the Snail to creep out . Happy & contented in my family life , I do not flatter my Ambition with much hopes of succeſs , tho ' the probability , of my appearing at the Election with credit to my friends & to myself , is pretty strong . But you must not suppose , that if I fail at the General Election , I shall start at every single Election afterwards . That I am not entitled to do , either from my Rank in the Peerage , or from my property in the Country . Where Sixteen are to be chosen , accident may throw the choice on Me , but vain as I may be , I have never wished to start singly . Lady Cathcart s legacy has been paid me , and her Executor Mr. Cosgrave sent me a copy of the bequests . The Will was dated 23 rd . March 1780 , ( when I was at Tewin Water ) it begins with directions for her Funeral . The bequests are as follows , viz . To the poor of the Parish of Tewin £25 . To her Grandson Fras- Lord Napier £200 Irish . To her Neice Valentine Malyn £200 Irish . To her Neice Frances Malyn £200 Irish .

To the said Margery Reynolds the further Sum of £1000 Irish . To Mrs- Cheshyre ( an old neighbour ) £100 .

To James Reilly & Phillip Reilly , Gardeners , £30 a peice & to each a Saddle horse . To Will . Calver , postilion , a One horse Chaise , Harneſs & a horse ; & to the said Will Calver & John Tyler the errand Boy Ten Guineas each . To her day labourers , all the sheep , hogs , pigs , the Aſs & foal , to be equally divided . To six poor old Woman , three Guineas each . The remainder of her fortune is bequeathed by the Will to Mr. Cosgrave , who is likewise named Sole Executor -- By a Codicil , dated 5 th . Octr- 1784 , She confirms her Will dated in March 1780 , except as to the alterations & additions following , To her Cousin John Loveday Esqr . of Caversham near Reading , Berks , £100 , & in case of his death before her , to his Eldest Son . To the said John Loveday , her Diamond Watch , Gold Chain & Diamond Equipage , & in case of his death , to go to his Eldest Daughter . To the said John Loveday , a Case with Silver handled Knives & forks & Spoons , & a large Silver Salver . In case of his death to go to his second Son . To Mary the wife of Arthur Warren Esqr . an Annuity of £20 ( Mrs- Warren died before Lady C . ) . To Mary Colly over & above what is given her by the Will , £20 . To all & every other Servant living with her at her decease , £10 each . To Lawrence Reilly nephew to Mrs- Colly , Ten Guineas . To Richd- Reynolds & Anne his Wife , over & above what is given them in the Will , £20 each . To the Son Richd- Reynolds £100 , over & above what is given him in the Will . To Richd . Reynolds & Anne his Wife , & to the longest liver of them , an annuity of Forty Pounds during their lives . These are all her legacies except to some Servants , who from having quitted her family , lost their right to receive them . Mr. Cosgrove informs me that her funds consisted of £8118 .. 7 .. 6 Irish Mortgage ( £2000 of which is disputed ) & some Money in the funds , which I beleive not to exceed two or three thousand Pounds , in which case , he will be no very great gainer by the Executry . You will , however , perceive the Cathcarts were never once thought of . Indeed their behaviour to her , for many Years , was far too magnificent to please . When she married my Grandfather she had no Jointure settled on her , but on his death , by our law , became entitled to one third of his property , which she immediately gave up to the late Lord . So scrupulous was she in retaining any part of my Grandfather s property , that I have seen his own receipt to her for £300 for a pair of Diamond Earrings , which she refused to accept on any other terms . I imagine the Jewells , You allude to , were given to the late Lady Cathcart , not to the present , if I remember right , they composed a Diamond Solitaire . My Mother got from her , an ornament for the hair , at the same time , which I sold for £50 or £60 . The anecdote , I never heard before . It is probably fact , tho ' perhaps exaggerated . The Baron was Genl . C——n 's , Aid de Camp ; the General , I consider to be at least half Mad . He very poſsibly might have behaved rudely to the Baron , but I dare say the holding the stirrup was very accidental , if ever it happened . Military people are sometimes severe , on those , who may have been more fortunate than themselves ; & as you know , I am not unnecessarily partial to the noble Baron , I think , you will give me credit for not wishing to extenuate the relation of Mr. D .. s acquaintance more than I really think probable . I rejoice to hear of Mr. Dickenson 's perfect recovery , & I hope , one day or other , our families may meet . If ever we do ; for the first day we shall look prim , endeavouring to by Lavater s rules to discover , whether we are pickpockets or not . Having tired of so silly an occupation , we shall give way to the natural corruption of our Nature , & our meeting will certainly resemble the march of a Troop of Geese from Lincolnshire . Much cackling , much gabbling , all wishing to ask questions & none waiting for an answer . N.B . This description is not intended to include Mr. D—— I trust to his rationality for bringing us back to a proper behaviour . Your Louisa too , will out-talk my Mary . By the bye , my Son William is this day three Years old , & exactly measures three feet . Those who see the crown of his head , I flatter myself do not see his heighth . Not that I wish the poor fellow to be suspended in the Air . I can perfectly well account for , the beginning of your letter , waiting from the 16 th - to the time of it 's ending the 28 th - Septr- , without poſseſsing any strong degree of the spirit of divination I have composed the colour of the Ink , & find the whole idea to be a poetical fiction , to cover , what in some people , I should call lazineſs & indifference . Perhaps you may endeavour to frame another apology , & I own it will please me to see the efforts of your ingenuity . I never was at Parkgate , nor n ever desire to be . It looks towards Ireland , I therefore affectionate it not . ( The last half line , is a little Hannah Moore ish . I not affectionate , it should have been ) . If You come to this Country & wish to see ruined Castles , we can show you many . Castles in ruins , are likewise no rarity , & Castles in the Air , thrive at Wilton Lodge , in as high perfection , as in most other places . Tho ' Grand Master Mason of Scotland , I find it difficult to discover proper foundations for those I build , but I perfectly agree with the author of Candide & Mr. Pope ( this to shew my reading ) that , whatever is , is right . Your insense was not incense to Me , as the explanation was a direct attack on my knowledge of the English language . I could pun on the word for half an hour , but that would cost you the price of a treble Letter . You can not grudge to pay double , as the reading the old Lady 's Will at D rs . Commons would have cost you half a Crown . Adieu . Beleive Maria & myself sincerely attached to You Mr. Dickenson & your Brat . I expect an additional Brat to my number next Month . Ever Your Affectionate friend & Brother Napier . P.S . Your Uncle F . s Son , I thought a Noodle ; perhaps he remains so still . The Pechells returned to England last Spring , & Charlotte has ( since her arrival ) produced a Son . You may thank the Rain ( which is inceſsant ) for the length of this Epistle . Nothing but the impossibility of getting out of doors could ever have induced me to scribble over two sheets of Paper . The Tiviot is full to the very top of it 's banks & my Cascade is tumbling down in a torrent of froth & smoak . These appearances are very beautifull , but my Oats are spoiling . I have had one field cut down for three weeks past , without being able to bring the sheaves into the stack yard . This is fine encouragement for a young Farmer .
