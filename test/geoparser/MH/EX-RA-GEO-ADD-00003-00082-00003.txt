Tuesday afternoon 25 th May 1779 My dearest Miſs Hamilton According to my promise I will now inform you who the person is I meant to speak to you of last Night . As you have bound yourself to me by such solemn promises of secre s c y and of friendship I dare now reveal to you the most secret thoughts of my Soul , such is the confidence I place in you . When I promised to name you the Lady ; you declared you would not think the worse of me on her account , or indeed on any , therefore trusting totally to yr . honor , I now declare that my fair incognita , is yr dear , dear , dear Self . Yr . manners , yr . sentiments , the tender feelings of yr . heart , so totally coincide with my ideas , not to mention the many advantages you have in point of person over many other Ladies , that I not only highly , esteem you , but even love you more than Words or ideas can expreſs . Nothing should have drawn this secret out of my lips , but the mutual promises of friendship & secresy we so lately made each other . Let not this declaration contribute to add any weight sink yr . spirits as I am convinced you have already too great weight upon them . I mean this totally as an act of confidence , or else I would not have mentioned it even to yourself . Adieu Dearest Miſs Hamilton & allow me to sign myself him who will esteem , & love you to the end of his life , G P . To Miſs Hamilton
