Whilst I was at Mr —— a Gentleman came in & related the following anecdote -- wch . perhaps had he known I was in the family he would not have done -- “ The Prince of Wales is a great Coxcomb in his dreſs -- but he is particularly attentive to the appearance of his feet , & wears such tight shoes & large Buckles that ye . King has taken every method to make him leave them off but without effect -- I heard , said he , the other day , that his Majesty orderd Lt. Coll . Lake to speak to his R : H : after having repeatedly spoke & havg . ordered Lt. Col : Lake to try to persuade him out of this folly & finding that he was obstinate upon ye . subject -- took the following method : He took ye . Prince a remarkable long walk through Bogs , up Hills , over stones & c. -- The Prince s shoes burst at ye . Sides & what with ye . weight of ye . Buckles & the tightneſs of ye . Shoes & ye . length of ye . walk his feet were covered wth . Blisters , & he was quite lame -- the King flattered himself he had gained his point , but ye . Prince 's obstinacy was proof against his sufferings , & he appeared at Dinner , & ever since in tight Shoes & large Buckles ” This was a pretty sort of conversation for me to hear -- I make no comments Do you like being marked out for a Coxcomb ?
