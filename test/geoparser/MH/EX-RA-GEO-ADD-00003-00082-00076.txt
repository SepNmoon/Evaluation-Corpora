recd- ye- 8 th Decbr 1779 Wedy . Morng . ¾ past 9 o'Clock My dearest Miranda I thank you for yr . kind & affectionate Note Lett er of Today . My dearest Friend does not seem to apprehend yt . ye . paſsion I have formed is for an Actreſs so yt . I scarcely dare flatter myſelf yt . she feels ye same love for me yt . I do for her , I am convinced yt . she understood ye . language of my eyes & of my actions , from her manner & ye . tender & bewitching glances she gave me . I her eyes sa y id more than words can expreſs . O Heaven -- was you but to see her , even if ye . most envious of her sex was to see her , they must confeſs , yt . she is almost ye most perfect beauty yt . ever was seen . However no more of these enthusiastic expeſsions or else you will take me to be mad , I know her to be very galant , & yet I can not help adoring her , however in a Day or two I will inform you what opinion she has conceived of my person & how she is content with it , for I have an excellent person to employ who is well acquainted with her , who will inform me of these particulars & you may depend on my informing you immediately by my # # I am glad by yt . Letter to perceive yt . dear is a great deal better , ye reports yt . have been spread about my Shoes are false for I never wear a shoe yt . is not perfectly easy , & yt . is not in ye . real shape of my foot . As to M. H . & my appearing in print with her I look upon yt . as nothing , as I never upon my honor ever gave ye smallest foundation for it . I am now going to advance My Miranda a maxim wh . you will I am afraid call detestable . Which is yt . I shd : be very sorry to form a connection with a Wife , or a Daughter , or a Sister in a family , where yt . family lives in perfect unity together but if ye . first advances are made to me I look upon it as highly unbecoming any young Man to refuse ym- . In ye case of Mrs .. R——n who lives totally separate from her husband , I look upon a connection in such her condition with her , & myſelf unknown , as impoſsible to lead to any mischief as there is no family peace disturbed by it . Be not too much offended at this declaration consider I am blinded by my paſsion yt I know not what I say or do or to what lengths it may not carry me . Did you but know ye . real history of ye unhappy object of it you cld . weep with tenderneſs over her fate , I will relate it to you ye . first time we meet . God Bleſs you & preserve you , ever unto death Yr . Friend Palemon toujours de même P.S . I will send you Thursday a list of my hours . A . A .
