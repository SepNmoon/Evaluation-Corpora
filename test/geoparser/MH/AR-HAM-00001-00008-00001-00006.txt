Wherwell -- Nov -- 18 -- 1789 -- I am particularly desired by my Father & Mrs. Iremonger to expreſs their sincerest heart-felt Thanks to our good Friends Mr- & Mrs- Dickenson for their solicitude about him , & kind proof of it in sending the Recipe , which they have experienced to have been so happily efficacious . -- my Father was inclined to have Faith in it , & tried it immediately , & has continued it ever since your Letters came , but we can not think with any present benefit yet . Indeed within this last fortnight my Father has been much worse again , his Thigh is swollen to the size of Two , & this came on suddenly even while He was in the continued practice of a recumbent Posture , which He is now advised never to vary except at his meals . -- He is dejected to a great degree , & has from the very first of the accident been persuaded that at his time of life , this confinement must terminate fatally . Yet no Disorder whatever ensues , his appetite remains good , his Rhumatic Pains have been some time leſsened , & at times have totally ceased ; but his size is very much reduced , & his Countenance fallen . In short He certainly is in a very melancholy affecting state , tho ' not immediately alarming ; and every Surgeon who has been consulted , ( and we have had all the advice the Country affords , & a fresh man of Eminence very lately , ) all declare , seperately , the same decisive unanimous opinion that , in a great lenth of time , He will recover . They none of them , have ever expreſsed the least doubt of it . He very much wishes on Mrs- Iremonger s account , that He could be removed to Town , that She might be in a warmer House & amongst her Friends ; but we do not at present see that it will be practicable . It would be scarcely poſsible to have him put into the Coach , & I very much fear He could not bear the same Posture for even one Stage . Poor dear Mrs- Iremonger as You will naturally imagine , is very low , & to add to our Grievances , She has had a complaint in her Eyes for several months , that has lately increased , is very troublesome to he r , & incapacitates her for any employment , & does not yield to any Remedy that has been advised her . I read to Both , & do what I can to alleviate , but indeed it is an afflicted House . Catharine is quite lively & well , drinks Aſses-milk , & is a little leſs Thin than She was . She sends her Love to Louisa , & would willingly accept her challenge for a Game of Play , if she was within distance . Think of your fine Friend Miſs Shipley having staid at Lady Dashwood 's till this time , & been introduced by Her to Lady Warwick at Warwick Castle . Cosi va il Mondo ! -- I enclose you some lines which poſsibly you may not have seen , I have no occasion to trouble you to return them . As my Uncle Lethr- goes between this & other Places , I had rather you would not direct any thing under Cover to him , unleſs you should have any double or treble enclosures to send , & then an addreſs to him in Seymour Place will always be forwarded wherever He is , if He is not to be found there . -- My Brother & all this House unite in affectionate compliments to Mr- & Mrs- Dickenson , & I remain with great Truth their Affectionate & Much obliged Friend & Servant E. Iremonger
