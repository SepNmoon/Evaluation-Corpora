Dublin Barracks 19 th . Febry . 1785 . My Dear Sister , Tho ' every paragraph of your letter requires an expreſs answer or opinion yet I must begin this epistle with my most favourite subject Self . Imprimis , I am actually Major to the King 's Own Regt- of Foot and am now strutting about with all the affected dignity of my New Office . My Commiſsion is dated the end of last Decr- tho ' it did not arrive in this Country 'till about Ten days ago . But this is the least part of the satisfaction I experience , for be it known to You that I am decidedly in the way of being saluted Father . About the Month of August ( if Maria continues to do as well as she has done ) I expect to be disturbed with the squalling of the little Imp . I shall almost detest the Brat for being born in this Country as I have not yet brought myself to admire it 's Inhabitants . I hope this does not proceed from a Narrowneſs of Ideas . I do not find myself more partial to a Scotchman than to an Englishman , but I confeſs I feel that tho ' I may be pleased with the plausibility of the Irish , yet I can neither trust nor love them . In the course of my Military Life I have formed intimacies & affections for people of the three kingdoms , but out of that Number I can not reckon many of this Nation . There is an attention wanting in the formation of their principles when Young , which they themselves do not seem to improve as they advance in Life , or to take any pains to correct . Your situation is truly unpleasant . I could say more on the subject , did I not conceive it would add to what you already feel . I sincerely hope old Mr. D . may be expeditious in the Settlement of his Affairs , or that he may be speedily released from the troubles of this World and conveyed to happier Mansions in the next . Either of which circumstances will forward your happineſs , and consequently give me real satisfaction . As to your Hub Elect I will endeavour to instill such principles of good Government into him that You will find it most prudent quietly to submit to his Authority which is & ought to be despotic . Such is the Authority established in my family . By keeping a steady Rein you prevent your horse from stumbling ; by keeping your Wife in good Order & Due subordination you prevent the habit of disputation which never ends well . Maria & I have neve r yet quar relled , & I have not an idea th at we ever shall . As to your Cousin Mrs- Stratford she is a compleat composition of Rouge & Pearl Powder . I will not say She has lost her Character , but I am justified in saying she is not unsuspected . I am not acquainted with her & indeed have only been once in Company with her . I did not wish to be introduced . Pray say many civil things in both our Names to the Stormonts . I do not write this impertinently , but I really mean it , as I confeſs I thought them attentive to me last Winter . As to Yourself you can not doubt the sincerity of my good Wishes . My Rib hopes you will beleive hers equally so . Best Compts- to Miſs Anne Clark & c & c Ever your faithfull & Affece . Friend and Brother N—— Miſs Hamilton Clarges Street IRELAND
