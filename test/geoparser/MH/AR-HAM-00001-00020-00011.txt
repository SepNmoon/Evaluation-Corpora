Balgowan 2 nd - Febry- 1779 . Since you are saucy and wo n't write to me , I 'll be revenged by writing often & making you pay the Postage -- I am at present upon a Visit to Mr- & Mrs- Graham , the latter of whom has very frequently & very affectionately enquired after you . She was always a prodigious favourite of mine & I find no reason to alter my good opinion of her . Tomorrow we go in a Body to Dunkeld , how Ducheſs Jane will receive us I 'm quite at a loſs to gueſs . Her Noble Hub ought to be ashamed to see me , as he has twice been guilty of a breach of promise to myself & to my friends -- Now that I have leisure I shall give you a short account of my Sisters & of the Situation in which I found them . To begin regularly & methodically I shall first touch upon Miſs Napier . Her person is not tall , thin & not ungraceful . Her countenance good were she a little fatter , but the Death of poor Mary has made a visible alteration in her looks . This joined to a natural lowneſs of Spirits has made her take a turn which I ever dreaded . In short she lives the life of a recluse ; aſsociates with none but of her own disposition & gives herself up so much to her religious duties as to make her in a great measure neglect her social ones . I see with Concern the way of Life she has got into , but find matters become too serious to afford even a hope of her relaxing in her strictneſs -- But this must be entre nous & go no further -- Harriot is short , rather inclined to be fat , chearful , lively , affectionate & is poſseſsed of as fine a countenance as I could wish . I am as much pleased with her improvement as I am hurt at the very serious turn of her elder Sister . Jane is a most delightful child , promises to be tall , has a remarkable degree of gentility in her figure & is reckoned in Temper & countenance not unlike her Brother . To the full as lightheaded . She is at present at a boarding School . I beg pardon for not sending you the Hair I promised , but shall take the first opportunity so to do , after my return home , which will be next week and to atone for my neglect by accompanying the Hair with a Miniature of my father which I doubt not will be equally acceptable . It will be copyed from a half length of him done by Sir George Chalmers , as it is by far the likest picture in my poſseſsion . Were I richer it should be set in gold , but in the mean time you must e'en take it in a shagreen Case . If I make out my Match with the Fair Miſstreſs of the Cannons , perhaps I may treat you to a better . Do n't forget to write to me soon & send the purse you was working for you me . Present my best respects to Lord & Lady Dartrey & Miſs K. Clarke
