Dear Miſs Hamilton I am quite Sorry that I am obliged to send You another Excuse ; But It Is quite Impoſsible for Me to come to You tomorrow . My Eyes have been very Bad since I wrote to You ; one still continues so ; the other Is quite Well ; & as I find Much Relief since Yesterday from a new Remedy , Hope In a few Days to be Much Better ; But can not Name any Day for coming to You ; the Weather Is so Bad for a Chair ; that I can not ask You to come so far ; unleſs any Friend can Accomodate You w . a Carriage ; am very Sorry It Is not in My Power to offer ours ; You will not doubt My Inclination , & My desire of seeing You ; but shd . not wish It , at the Expence of any Inconvenience to you ; so that as I shall probably be confined some Days ; any Eveng . that suits you shall be glad If you will call ; -- pray tell Mrs. Delany , that the Complaint In My Eye , prevents My going on w . Her Knotting at present ; I gave some to Lady Wallingford on Tuesday -- I shall go on , as soon as I am Better ; -- I am dear Miſs Hamilton Yrs . Most Affecly -- Frances Harpur Thursday --
