My dear I am pretty well but do not go to Mrs Montagu s tonight -- you know it is my Brother s Ball -- I shall be delighted to see you tomorrow at ½ past ten or 11 -- I shall certainly be up then & should naturally be so much earlier notwithstang the Ball had I not the prospect of a long fatig ui n g Drawingroom before me -- I have three caps in the world which my maid is now shewing yours -- I never wear anythi n g on my neck but a square handk or yard of Gause at the inside of my Gowns & a double pleati n g of blond round my shoulders when I am much dreſsed , none except then -- but most my Gowns have capes to them -- adieu God bleſs you -- I expect you tomorrow -- Mrs Dickenson
