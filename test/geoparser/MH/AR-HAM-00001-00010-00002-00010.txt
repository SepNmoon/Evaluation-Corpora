Bedford Row Augst : 14 th : 1801 It is such a time my dearest Mrs : Dickenson since I have written to you or to dear Louisa that I feel quite ashamed of taking up my pen now & writing to you on such a very shabby piece of paper but I can not now get any other & I had rather write you a few lines now this day than delay it any longer : I do not know whether Mary has written to you lately but I hope she has . I rec 'd a most kind & affecte . Letter from Mr. D . when I was last at Bromley & I am truly obliged to you for your kind invitation to Leighton Hse for a day or two . I need not say how very very happy I shou 'd be to accept it & but it must much depend upon the time Mr : W : en has from home . I hope we shall visit you in our way down : to morrow the 15 th : is the day fixed for my marriage . & it is one that I have at present every reason to believe I shall ever remember with pleasure but I think it such an awful one that I can not help feeling very anxious & uncomfortable to day . I hope indeed am certain that I have your good wishes : indeed my dear Mrs : Dickenson I shall ever most gratefully remember the many kindneſses I have received from you & Mr : D . pray give my best to him & dear Louisa : I quite long to see her & believe me ever my dear Mrs : Dickenson most affecte . & sincerely Katherine Jackson Fanny desires her kind love & Mr. Warren begs I will remember him to you & to Mr. D . . I leave Bedford Row this evening : tomorrow we go to Trowbridge for a short time & I hope shall not be disappointed in the wish I have formed of finding a Letter from some one of yr : family when I return to Bromley tho ' I think I hardly merit it : I shall write soon again to Louisa . You will easily imag ine the hurry I am in & there fore I hope it is needleſs to make any apology for suc h a scrawl Mrs. Kinderley 's kind Compts . & my love to Mrs. Morriſon .
