My Dear Miſs The Docr . has just been here , he does not discourage us , but says , he finds still a very smart Fever , which must keep us in sad Anxiety , as her State is so precarious till the Fever is removed , for whilst that lasts in any Degree on any so weak a Frame , the Danger is great . indeed my dear I can not say how much I suffer . I am hurt also that my Anxiety here , keeps me from a Personal Enquiry after Pſs Elizabeth , but have the Comfort of being aſsured by Turton he sees nothing alarming about her & hopes with a little care her Complaint will go off . I shall hope to have a good Account of her tonight , when you are so kind as to ſend here , I dont know at what time the Docr . is to call , but wish you to ſend between ten & eleven as by that time one can judge of the Progreſs of the day . Ever Sincerely Yrs . CFinch ½ past 4 April 1780
