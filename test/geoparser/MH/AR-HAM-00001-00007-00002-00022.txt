Dear Madam I had promised myself the pleasure of waiting on you soon after your obliging enquiry , but the severity of the Weather and a great Cold confined me to the House almost ever since , but as I am no longer under restraint I shall do myself that honor very soon . I was inform 'd that Mrs Hamilton in Manchester Square wanted a Servant in Sally s Place , the Young Woman the bearer of this I wish much to recommend ; I have known her some Years She is a Virtuous good tempered Girl , can dre≈øs hair and is otherwise qualified to wait on a Lady , if Mrs Hamilton is not already provided I shall be obliged to you if you will recommend Her , and I trust she will not discredit your recommendation . I am Dear Madam Your Most Obedient Humbl- Ser Maria Matilda Nevin Queens House Wednesday feby- 25
