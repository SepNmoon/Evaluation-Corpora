My Dear Miranda I have been made very happy in hearing such good accounts from time , to time ; of you & and your sweet Babe , going on so well ; I hope at present you have not a thought in leaving Bath till April , upon the account of your Dear Child , not being able to bear the shake of so great a journey ; you know I love you both ; & it was always my intention to pay you a visit , before you left Bath ; but I must k now tell you how I am circumstanc 'd , a neice of mine is come up to Town , to be married ; & I ca n't leave London till the 22 d . of March , having busine≈øs to settle with her intended Spouse . -- it 's a match , I very much app r ove of , He being a sensiable Man , & a Man of good character ; therefore I must dread my Purse strings . pray give me an answer to this , for if time suits , I shall write to Mrs. Prattinton for Lodgings ; Mary & I intend to set off Post . I suppose your saucy husband , now he has arrived to the honor of being a father , there wil be no bearing him I am in great haste . yours affectionately E Glover my love to your good Dickinson -- Mrs. Glover Feby 27 -- 1787
