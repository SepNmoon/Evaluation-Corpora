Jany 8 th 1803 . My dear Sister , I had intended writing this morning to my dear Louisa , but as I find my Father has anticipated my design I will send her a long letter the first opportunity & addreſs this to you . -- We are much obliged to you for a very fine Pheasant , we propose to invite Mr & Mrs Robinson to partake of it , for as they are our best friends in this neighbourhood , I am convinced you will have pleasure in knowing they will join us in doing honor to to your acceptable gift . As , agreeable to your wishes I burnt your last letter ; perhaps I shall not be very accurate in answering it ; indeed the subject is so exquisitely painful , that I shall not easily be tempted again to enter upon it . I am sorry it is not in my power to subscribe implicitly to your advice ; the measure you recommend woud if adopted , woud be attended with so many difficulties & uneasinesses for which I coud not give a sufficient reason , that I have neither resolution or courage to adopt it , besides , I can not help thinking it woud be laying a mine , & probably facilitate an evil we must all most anxiously wish to prevent . You must my dear sister be sensible that in this affair I wish to be guided by the best motives , & to follow that path in which there is the least apparent danger ; and after weighing this subject with the most careful attention I am thoroughly persuaded that time or accident must make the changes we so fervently wish for . As poſsitive assistance is vain , where we have no right to controul , I believe to bear this affliction patiently is the best method to consult my own comfort or tranquility of mind . I find the weight of my distreſs abated by sometimes conversing with my very excellent freind Mr : Robinson on this subject ; I feel often relieved by opening my mind to a person who has my interest sincerely at heart ; & I am not now so much oppreſsed as when I thought it neceſsary to conceal every circumstance with the most persevering watchfulneſs . I will own I am a little piqued at the reason your friend has given for declining to visit me -- surely my character woud protect her from contamination if she was to condescend to breathe the tainted air at Birch Hall sometimes , My society is now courted by women equally tender of their reputation , & as unsullied in their principles , as herself & I can not help adding I think her excuse whimsical , ridiculous , weak ; & altogether unworthy of a woman of sense or of feeling . What woud become of me at the time I want the greatest support , if every one was to be equally fastidious ? -- Now I know you will say this is the overflowing of Sarah 's impetuosity but I aſsure you I am not in a paſsion ; my observa tions are the result of cool reflection , & temperate anger . -- I do not think I have ever told you that I am comfortably fixd with women servants ; but all system & regularity has been forgotten during the agitating search after the papers , but I intend now , to be more attentive to household affairs , & if I do not execute them , I shall begin the new year with many good resolutions . I think if my B—— was to propose to propose to my Father to sign the leases he grantd to his tenants , that he woud be much pleased . You know I never recommend any measure that does not tend to your advantage , or the peace of the family . -- I am anxious to hear from Elizabeth , she was in a very discontented state when I last heard from her . a Gentleman has sent me a little dog , & M rs Homespun has behaved so well on the occasion that she has soften 'd my heart a little . I beg you will give my love to my B . my sweet saucy niece whom I intend to rival in notability , & Miſs M—— Compts to Miſs Martin . I remain your affct sister SD Mr R is to take this letter to the office as I dare not trust it in common hands . I mean to get green doors to our rooms to prevent listeners . I have no tim e to read this letter over so you m ust have it with all its faults . To Mrs : Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire
