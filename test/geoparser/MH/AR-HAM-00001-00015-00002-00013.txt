Windsor 17 th - April 1781 11 oClock at Night You might I think my Dear Friend have imagin 'd that I should wish to have recd . some accounts of your health -- not a word do you say respecting it , though you know you were far from Well on Saturday Eveg . when we met at Mrs : Culling Smith s . The King told me he thought you look 'd very Ill at Chapel on Sunday , this I I did not hear till too late to make an enquiry before I left town -- I can not help therefore judging from your silence that you are worse than when I saw You -- you surely would not have withheld from me the satisfaction of knowing you were better . We came here about 7 on Sunday & spent the Eveg . in conversation ( Madm Hardenberg is in ye . House ) Yesterday Morng . Rhea had letters to write , so P ſ 's . Royal Sabine—— -- Eliza & the Genl- Genl . Frytag and myself took a pleasant walk round ye little Park ; I paſs 'd ye . Seat whereon we had sat together & felt a sensible pleasure in the recollection , I trust my Astrea Friend we shall this Summer contrive frequent interviews of ye . same Kind -- what a proof of the real comfort & pleasure arrising from Virtu ous connections the remembrance of past scenes are never painful -- can any thing my love be more pure , more sacred than our connection ? Friday Thursd ay 19 th . You may see my friend by the Crumpled appearance of this paper how long I 've worn it in my pocket -- it is hardly poſsible for me to scribble a dozen lines at this place -- I have just been made happy by your Dr . Letter of yesterday -- I endulg 'd indulged RH with a sight of it -- God bleſs you I mus t send this scrap or you will not hear fr om me before my return ; I really have not had an instant to myself -- I will come go to you , or you had better come to me Saty . I will order some trifle thing for us to eat together , in my Room 4 oClock . we will then talk over my week 's absence God Bleſs you once More 17 April 1781
