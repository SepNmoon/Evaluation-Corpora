East Bourne 30 th - June 1780 Did my Astrea know how my fully my time is employ 'd she would not be “ so unreasonable ” , I have at this time ten letters unanswer 'd upon my table , -- I was however very sorry the post should go away yesterday without a letter for you -- Rhea was the occasion of it , for she had written me a very long & friendly letter , & it would have been highly improper for me not to have answer 'd i t immediately . -- I have been a good deal indisposed -- a pain in my back , & violent Cold in my Head -- this has prevented my Bathing wch . I had intended doing before now -- I have not been confin 'd to ye . house -- my cold is better , & ye . pain in my back is gone . Perfecta is much pleased wth . your remembrance & both she & Mr. Bruyeres desired me to present their best Compts . -- ye . latter said a great many fine things but you have so many fine things said to you daily , that I wont tire you with repeti tions How comes it , yt . ye . Dſs . of Ancaster is at Tunbridge ? -- poor Woman ! my Heart bleeds for her , -- pray continue to send me all ye . intelligence you can about her & her Daughters . -- is Lord Althorpe better ? The more I am acquainted wth our society ye . more I approve , & like them -- Mr. Farhill is about 27 -- handsome , modest , amiable & well bred , I believe he was , upon before he was appointed preceptor to P. E . , pursuing ye . Study of ye . law -- he appears to have profited by a liberal education ; reads , & recites remarkably well -- writes poetry in an easy , elegant manner , -- at least if I can judge from a translation of a latin Epitaph he gave Perfecta the other morng . -- Mr. Fisher is in the Church , he is some years older than Mr. F . , about 35 -- he has not ye . same advantage of person , yet there is nothing disagreeable -- his countenance is an index of his mind -- wch . I really believe is perfectly amiable -- he has talents , taste , & genius -- he draws finely , & is continually taking advantage of this delightful accomplishment by taking views of every prospect worthy his pencil -- he has travell 'd a good deal , & nothing seems to have escap 'd his observation , either of ye . useful or elegant . Mr. Farhill , reads to us in English -- Mr. Bruyeres in French -- & Mr. Fisher is giving me & Pſs . E instructions in drawing -- he has given me a task for Lands capes the Gentlemen take it by turns to explore ye . Country for us -- & then are our guides to the most picturesque paints of view & c & c & c . Yesterday we went to Pevensey -- the Noble Ruin of a Castle of that name is worthy observation -- I wish you could have seen me clambering up the ruins & seated in what they call 'd ye . Parson 's chair -- perch 'd like a Magpie -- King William ye . Conqueror landed here -- & Oliver Cromwell destroy 'd this vast & Noble Building -- I want much to know more about it -- but I could get no further intelligence -- I suppose in some of ye . d es criptions of ye . Antiquities of England one may meet wth . some account of it -- ask Sir Robert . I have yet said nothing of the advantage we experience by the vicinity of East Bourne Place Lady Betty Compton to whom it belongs , has politely given their R H -- ye . priviledge of going thither whenever they chuse -- we daily walk in the Gardens & Grounds -- the Children can there enjoy ye . benifit of shade -- & we have the liberty of going into ye . House whenever we please -- we often spend an hour in the library -- the House is not Modern -- but it is pretty large , convenient , & well calculated for comfort & society . it is in perfect repair -- & has the elegance of neatneſs beyond what I ever saw . You tell me Bell is unwell -- I hope she has no return of ye . complaint that alarm 'd you so much at Bath -- my love to her , & tell how very sorry I am to know she is not well -- & yt- she has m y best wishes for a speedy recovery -- indeed my Dear I can not begin a correspondence wth . Miſs J—— had I once done so I should not have been so impolite as to have drop 'd it -- but as it is , she can not expect a letter -- My best Compts- to her -- but pray do not get me a new correspondent -- besides . I never write
