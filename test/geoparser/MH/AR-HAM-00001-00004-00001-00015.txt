Latour -- Clontarf near Dublin July 17 th . 1780 . Dear Miſs Hamilton , In compliance with your desire , which perfectly agrees with my own inclination , I seize this earliest opportunity to thank you for your most obliging letter of the 8 th . of this Inst . and to return the papers it contain 'd . I desire no stronger or more convincing proof of your confidence in me , which in one respect only , I feel myself worthy of a consciousneſs of my being incapable of betraying it for any earthly consideration . I shall not be free from anxiety , till I know you are again in poſseſsion of the papers . I tremble to trust them under a cover rather vaguely directed . I am at a loſs which to admire most the sound sense , or the sentiments so distinguishingly expreſsive of an excellent heart . My ideas of the writer are greatly raised , and you know how high they were before . You very justly feel yourself in a most happy situation situation ; you are mistreſs of the degree of estimation you may chuse to acquire ; you cou 'd not already be in poſseſsion of so much , without the ability of making still further advances ; there is no exhausting the source of virtuous merit still leſs the poſsibility of abating the approbation of it in elevated minds . I took the opportunity of your having mentioned , that Lady Stormont imagined that I might have taken it amiſs in not having receiv 'd any notification of the birth of her second son , to write to her , and I received a very proper and obliging answer , so that there is now an end of that matter ; that being the case , I am sure you will not be angry with me for having made use of your name , which I did only en paſsant , without which , I cou 'd not have brought myself to have wrote to her upon the subject ; I touched upon no other ; to insinuate a feeling of neglect , and to ask favors at the same time is sometimes done , but is it not an indication of an abject mind ? I am very sorry to hear Lord Cathcart 's health will not permit him to continue in America till the end of the war , which I look upon now to be at no great distance . I really think you are likely to find more benefit from seabathing with exercise on horseback than from any medical prescriptions ; you have weak nerves which bathing and riding are very proper provided there is no fear in the case , for that wou 'd indeed destroy their good effect ; but what you recommend to others , I am sure you have fortitude enough to show an example of yourself . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be affectionately rememberd to you ; my daughter Jane is well & growing fast , she will be twelve years old in October . Mrs. Stratford comes to Town on Wednesday next upon the busineſs I mention 'd in my last , she is truely unfortunate , -- a fine understanding & great sensibility -- to no understanding & the greatest brutality Adieu My Dear Miſs Hamilton continue your confidence & affection & believe me in return Your very faithful Uncle & Friend Frederick Hamilton
