Janry : 1787 Albemarle Street Janry . 29 th . 1787 We receiv 'd the happy news on Saturday of our dear friend being safely brought to bed , I lose no time in sincerely congratulating my dear brother on this occasion , in which Mrs .. Lenton unites , my Mother will answer for herself as she intends writing by this post ; how I should like to see you , so anxious , so busy & so happy ; walking tip toe into your wive s Apartment , asking with the greatest tenderneſs how she has rested , peeping at the little brat , & if it is awake taking it up in your arms , & then trying to find out who it is like & for fear of hurting it return it with such care into the nurses arms , I think it is almost too young at present to sing “ lull a by baby ” to it , I amuse myself in thinking all this , because I can not see you , how much I wish I could , but Alas I must give up all thoughts of seeing Bath , I am in too good health to want the waters , I only wish 'd to see too very dear friends & the third , though a stranger I will love for there sakes ; I shall conclude my letter with a peice of advice my dear Father used to give to the Friends of all lying in Women , that for the first ten days they ought to be kept quite quiet , & that even the husband should not be too much with her without he can hold his tongue as it is talking that fatigues the woman in her present weak condition , & by no means to suffer her to see her friends to soon ; thus much for my dearest father s advice , now for a little of my own saucineſs , you must know that I think you ought not to be too much with your Mary as I am sure you can neither of you help talking when you are together , & her spirits being remarkably good it may fatigue her more that she or you think s at the time , My love to your excellent wife Mrs. Lenton 's best compts . to both , I remain Dear Mr. Dickenson yr .
