71 , Queen Street 11 th - June r - 1814 My Dear Sister , If you have ever condescended to think , or speak of me , or mine , since I left London , I have no doubt that it had been to abuse me , for not writing . If so , You have been most unreasonable , for You must have known , that my Royal Occupation 's would not admit of my scribbling . They , happily finished ten Days ago , and I have outlived the danger of dying in an Alderman like manner , from overeating , and overdrinking . As sitting never agrees with me , I felt some little inclination in my Legs , to refuse to do their Duty , when I begun to walk again ; but , I have now convinced them , that they are no longer to consider themselves as Royals , and that I insist on their performing Plebian functions , properly , as usual . It is now time to enquire how You , your better half , and your excellent Daughter , find Yourselves amidst the Bustle of Emperors , and King 's in London . How shocked I am , that Great Men will not be truly Great , but will expose their frailties to the Vulgar Eye . How can any Man conceive , that by degrading his Wife , he does not cast a Reflexion on Himself ? The Letters which have lately appeared in the Newspapers vex me . Who are the Advisers , or whether there are any Advisers in the busineſs , I know not . But , at a time of rejoicing , for accommodating our differences with Foreign Foes , our domestic Squabbles should be allowed to divide the public Mind is much to be lamented . My Son William was made a Post Captain in his own Ship the Erne , on the 6 th . Instant . He is gone from Heluvet to Bourdeaux , with Money for the Troops ; and , from thence , he proceeds to America , without coming to Britain I believe . Francis , has left the Snake , and is on board Admiral Brown 's Ship , ( the name of which , I know not ) at Port Royal , Jamaica . At least , so I am informed by Admiral George Hope , who had a Letter from Admiral Brown , dated the first of April . The Youth , has not been pleased to announce this change in his Situation , to me , so that I am quite ignorant of the Cause of it . My Sons are apt to think that if they know what they are about themselves , it is unneceſsary to inform me , unleſs they want Money , and then indeed , they do condescend to put Pen to Paper . Charles , is in high preservation . At present , he is in the Country , waiting on one of our Staff General 's , Sir John Dalrymple . I expect him back on Monday , what his fate will be , I have still to learn . I wish His Royal Highneſs the Commander in Chief , would let me into the Secret . When I went to London I took with me the Plans of my Ho use at Thirlestane , for your Edification , for that of my Son William . Neither of You , took the trouble of looking at them . To punish him , I have a great Mind not to finish the House , though all my Doors , Windows & Window Shutters , have been made for it , during my Absence . I did not expect this , and was much surprised on finding they were ready to be sent to Selkirkshire . Next Week , they will be sent off , and some Weeks hence , I may go to Thirlestane to look how the Plasterers go on . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Give my best Love to Mr. Dickenson & Louisa , but , take none of it to Yourself . My Rib & c send her Civilities & their Civilities . Ever Your faithful Friend & Affecte- Napier Edinburgh , Twelfth June 1814 Mrs- Dickenson 32 , Devonshire Place London Napier .
