London Portman Sqr Dec : 17 th Dear Madam A letter from Mrs Dickenson must alway increase the joy of a recent happy event , or revive that of of a former one ; & I find my felicity increased by the part you have the goodneſs to take in it , & have therefore great pleasure in aſsuring you Mrs Matthew Montagu 's health is not impaired by the present she has made us of a jolly boy almost as big herself , The Parents , & the Babe , are now at Southampton , Mr Montagu was a good deal out of health all the Summer , but having been advised by his Physician pretty late in ye Autumn , to try the effect of Sea bathing , they prudently fixd on Southampton as affording a comfort able retreat in the Winter , if he found benefit enough from bathing to induce him to continue it during that Season , I had the comfort of seeing him come to Town at the meeting of the Parliament much improved in health . They left ye Child at Southampton under the care of a trusty Servant , & on Wednesday last returnd thither with a resolution to stay till the H : of Commons meets after the holy days . I am much delighted to find , that Mr Dickenson & you intend to come to Town in the Spring . I know it is unfashionable to come to London before XmaſsChristmaſs , but for my own part , I confeſs , I love it best in its demi Saison character , when it is neither a Solitude nor a Crowd . I had indeed a great mortification at my coming to Town in finding my amiable Friend Mrs Vesey in a most declining condition . your friend Miſs A Clark s humane attentions are a great comfort to her , minds like hers , like Aromatick Herbs , & sweet flowers , even when wither 'd & decay 'd retain a sweet odour . She is still affectionate to her Friends , & benevolent to all , but her mental powers are sadly impaired . I long to be introduced to dear little Miſs Dickenson from every reason I expect to find her amiable . All reports , true , or untrue , are so circulated by the news papers that it is not poſsible to send ones Correspondents any news . It is said Miſs Pulteney is to marry Lord Ancram , if Cupid advises it , I think even the Goddeſs of Prudence can not make any Objection to the Union . I beg leave to present my best compliments to Mr Dickenson & that you would give a kiſs for me to the dear little Lady in token of future friendship With perfect esteem I am dear Madam your most affectionate & Obliged Humble Servant Eliz Montagu Mrs. Montagu Decbr . 17 th . 1787 Mrs Dickenson Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire
