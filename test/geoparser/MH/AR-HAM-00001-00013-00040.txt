Sunning Hill August 21 st . 1786 My dearest Miſs Glover I take up my pen to make my enquiries after you , Dear Mrs : Dickenson , your worthy Father & sisters ; who I can easily imagine are not at all sorry for that you are return 'd home again , for they must miſs your charming spirits & your conversation , we think of you both very often , & not very seldom wish you one of the party . We have had company with us the whole time we have been in the Country excepting this last week & to day we go to Eton to fetch Mr .. Dickenson who will stay some time with us ; she is happy in having a very amiable man for her husband , he is at present absent with Mrs .. Luxmore in Scotland . We are very gay here , about ten days ago we had a publick breakfast at the Wells , their were an hundred & forty people there , we had the musick from the Camp , and a charming band it it is , I danced three dances , for we made up a Country dance for twelve couple ; every body was pleased which is saying a great deal in the favor of our entertainment , there will be another this day seven-night , my Mother did not chuse to go , Lord Dalkeith Mrs. Lenton & myself were the party . Miſs M—— Bourdieu one of the sisters you saw in Clarges Street , is return 'd from Bruſsels , very amiable & very accomplished , upon her return home her sisters wish 'd to make her take against her father as they had done , she refused saying he was too good & indulgent to them to merit the treatment he he had received , upon which she met with every ill-treatment which malice ill-nature & hatred can devise , she is now on a visit to Miſs Anna Maria Bourdieu s , & will very shortly come to us . -- You enquire about the Bond & the printing of my dearest Father s work ; the former is settled & I have the money now in my poſseſsion , after meeting with the vilest treatment from Mr. Chollet & Mr , their is nothing that they could say that was bad that they have not against my dear Father , whose Charecter was too well known thank God for it in the least to Suffer by it , I always thought them worthleſs people but never so very bad a they really are . In regard to the a A thenaid every thing is settled , & it will be publish 'd next Febry- the number of Copies are one thousand ; Mrs .. Strohoff thinks they will all be sold . -- I was quite happy to read Mr. Collier praises of little Mr. D .. pray tell her from me that I beg to be remember 'd to her & that her little cousin is very well & as great a favorite as ever , I never felt so interested for any one upon so short an acquaintance as I did for Minikin , I am therefore quite glad she suits you so well . My Mother was in Town the other day , when she saw Sally who inform 'd her that Mrs : Hamilton had sold his house in Bedford Square & had purchased a most charming peice of ground at the further end of Oxford Street opposite Hyde park & was going to build a very good house ; the very next door to where they are building a the gentleman wish 'd to let his house for three years , Mr. Hamilton has taken it , & they move into it this week .
