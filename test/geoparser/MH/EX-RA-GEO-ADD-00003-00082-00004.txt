2 7 8 th . May 1779 Friday I flatter myself , my dearest Miſs Hamilton that you are not displeased at the confeſsion I made to you in my last Letter , as I do in the solemnest manner declare and protest , that had it been my good fortune , to have been placed in such a ſtation in life , as to have had the happineſs of calling you mine , I should have looked upon it as the greatest happineſs bleſsing that could have befallen me . For after the impetuous ardor of youth , and the violent impulse of paſsion , is paſsed , then it is that one wishes to find in a Companion for life , such sentiments and such feelings as you poſseſs , and which I have known very few Women enjoy to so superior a degree as yourself . All I have now to say is , that I flatter myself you are not offended at the liberty I have taken in so openly declaring my sentiments to you , as it is to be attributed to the mutual aſsurances of trust and confidence we made each other . If I have offended , I beseech of you , the first opportunity we meet , be it for ever so so short a time , or wherever it be , either in the Gardens when we are at our walk or in their Majesties ' Appartments , you would by word of Mouth , or by some sign which I may underſtand , let me perceive , either yr . approbation for this act of my entire confidence , or yr . pardon for this my indiscretion . Adieu ever dear Miſs Hamilton , and believe , that it will always be my greatest happineſs to sign myself Yr . GP
