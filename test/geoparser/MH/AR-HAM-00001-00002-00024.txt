Bath July 25 -- 1789 I sent you a letter to day with an account of my health & will begin another to follow it soon , as I know you will not be quite easy -- 26/ I went with the Major & Miſs Davies to S t . Michael 's Church , when “ we praise thee O Lord ” was chaunted delightfully -- as it was a Sacrament day we had no Sermon -- I attended my party home , went and drank a glaſs a water , from thence to the abbey where I heard a part of a good Sermon -- I walked half an hour & then called upon Mrs. Rundell -- I found Mr . & Mrs. , Randolf the famous preacher there -- I perceived that She was pensive & low in the extreme & when the priest took himself away I enquired the reason of it -- She informed me that She was quite overcome with Mr. R 's Sermon I believe the length of it might contribute to make her languid as he preached full three quarters of an hour -- & I observed last Sunday that her Tears flowed plentifully -- to do Mr. R—— justice -- he certainly is a good preacher -- the Sermon I heard was upon the Subject of the prodigal which he laid before us in every poſsible point of view & drew a very fine Conclusion from it -- Dr. Fothergill called on me before I returned home & staid half an hour with Mrs. Davies in hopes of my returning -- I left my Name at Mrs. Holroyd 's in my way to the Isted 's where I dined at 3 -- Mr. Lockwood ( eldest brother to Mr . & Miſs Lockwood who are so much at Mr. Thursby s ) who had his Eyes shot out when he was a School boy at Westminſter -- & Miſs Jekil , to whom he is going to be married , were of the party -- also Mrs. Mary -- This was a Turtle feast I had a great deal of conversation with Mr. L . about the family at Abindon -- he told me that Mr. T . had given up the thought of making his second Son a Clergyman -- that he was treated as a fool by Mr. T . & his eldest Daughter , which was a discouragement to ye young man -- & must check all desire in him to do well -- one day Mr. Lockwood made enquiries after ye young man of his Sister , who said “ She knew nothing about him , for she had not seen him for 3 days ” , upon Enquiry he found that he was in or about the house & paſsed most of his time in the stables -- he must be received for his Father seems to hate him & as an instance of his odd behaviour I must mention one circumstance -- that he wont permit him to ride one of his horses , tho he keeps 6 hunters & half a hundred besides -- this young Man is extremely ignorant Mr. L says -- but this Mode of treatment is not likely to improve his head or his Heart -- his destiny is for the army -- How Horrid it must be -- to be hated by that person who was the Cause of our Existence -- I hope Mr. Thursby 's Son has very little feeling -- Mr. L—— said he had talked very seriously to Miss T . on her behaviour to her Brother -- at 7 I left the social Board & went to Lady Huntingdon 's Chapel , I was rather too late for the Singing , which drew me there and was obliged to wait till the Sermon was ended for a psalm which was delightfully sung -- 27 / I called upon Dr. F . he said he was just setting out to call upon me , as he wanted to see me -- for he was going to Weymouth for a few days -- he said he saw no neceſsity for my staying here longer than 20 days or a fortnight for if the Dog days shd . be hot , it would not be so well for me -- after my little Tour he said he shd . be a better Judge & advised me to go on drinking at the Croſs Bath & taking his Medicine -- as soon as I came home your dear Letter of the 22 was put into my hand -- I am sensible my dearest Girl that it is empoſsible for you , consistent with your Love for me , to make me an unreasonable request -- therefore if you were to expreſs ever a Wish that I shd . entirely lay aside my favorite amusement -- your wishes shall be complied with dont think my Love that my return to you could be hastened by a desire to go a Shooting -- No such thing I love you too ardently not to long exceſsively to be with you -- and if ever I shd . be so unhappy , a to leave home again without being able to take my Wife & Child with me , I must cast Lotts for one of them Pray thank my dear father for his tenderneſs for me This is Wednesday 29 th July -- and I have only a few minutes to spare to tell you my dear Mary -- that I am in the most perfect health & Spirits -- the Irritation is almost totally gone -- I have good Appetite eat & sleep well , which I have not done till lately -- no person can be better -- I send you this Scrap with my whole heart except as much as you will allow for Louisa , dear Louisa 's portion , that you may have no Anxieties about me Adieu Adieu God bleſs You My best Friend Ever Yrs .
