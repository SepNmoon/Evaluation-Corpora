Dec Friday St Jamess -- 15 1786 Nothing could exceed my surprise , at seeing a letter from you my dear Friend , lying on my Table to day on my return from my airing , with the Bath Post mark upon it . I have been thinking of you these several Days paſsed fixed at Northamton , and have been wishing for , if not absolutely expecting a letter from thence , to tell me how you liked , & how you felt in , your new situations . The beginning of your letter alarmed me exceedingly so sudden a change in your plans , seemed to indicate an immediate neceſsity for Bath , which was quite frightful -- Thank God you and conclude by so good an account both of yourself and Mr Dickenson that I am quite easy about you -- I would not that anything should vex you now for the World -- tell me as often as you can without inconvenience to yourself , my dear Friend how his Health improves , & that your spirits continue good -- You can not conceive what I feel when you say , “ pray come to Bath , contrive it , do not let any trivial Obstacle prevent your coming ” Alas my dear I would give anything to go , ill as I am , I should set out at an hours warning , if there was a poſsibility of doing it -- You may imagine I wish much to be with my Family , my Sister -- the Hobart 's , The Bridgemans are there , and now you , whom above all I wish to see ! For how long since we have met ! How long perhaps nay most likely , before we meet again ! what would I give to have you here just at this minute to spend a comfortable Evening with me -- I have been at home ever since this Day fortnight , and am not better , sometimes Ly Carlisle comes to sit with me , whenev er she can get out -- once I had Ly Louisa S . but she is gone out of Town -- Madame Reventelau is gone again too -- so that I am often quite alone , or with my little Girl who is a very pleasant Companion I aſsure you never makes impertinent remarks , very docil & very charming -- Did the Hours otherwise paſs heavily along , she would occupy & amuse me sufficiently but I believe I need not aſsure you that I always find more occupation , such as it is , than I have time for -- However I could put it aside tho ' without regret for that of conversing with you -- Would I could promise myse lf that comfort in any fixed future time ! To return to the Bath Scheme , Mrs Harcourt is too well to think of it now -- she will go in Spring , when I shall neither have the power , nor the wish of accompanyi n g her . I am glad you are in comfortable Lodgi n gs my dear my Father found it very difficult to procure any it must have become more so now . Is this the first time of your bei n g at Bath ? you will like the Local & as for the humours of the Place , I imagine you will lead too retired & quiet a life to be acquainted with them , but I think they are detestable . That continually livi n g in publick , that impoſsibility of being denied , the Tittle Tattle , the heat , the Rain , the dirt -- make it a detestable sejour -- tell me what you see & hear of my Sister -- how she conducts herself , what are her manners , behaviour , what is thought & said of her & c & c -- this I expect from your sincere , impartial Friendship -- I fancy she has no remains of that illneſs & those low spirits which absolutely made my life wretched for some time this Autumn -- I fear she lead s too diſsipated a life -- Tell my how are my dear Fat spirits -- does he play at Whist every night -- I hop e you will see them -- now for a word about myself Turton comes every day , & has healed me for the Rheumatism of which the return of the pain at night seems to be a symptom -- yet nothing has hitherto relieved me -- I am goi n g to take Bark in quantity that I am awake & in spirits I do not understand for every night is spent in Pain , & never have I an Hours sound sleep -- yet I am otherwise well -- & happy . I sent my last letter to Courteenhall , not knowi n g a more exact direction -- Let me hear how you go on as often as you can -- I answer your letter immediatly & you will get this on Sunday -- pray do not walk any more up to Brock Street -- it is very bad for you -- God bleſs you my dear Friend -- adieu your affec : since re CMG -- remember me kindly to Mr D -- To Mrs Dickenson No 2 Abbey Street Bath Honble .
