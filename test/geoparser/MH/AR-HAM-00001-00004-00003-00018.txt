N o : 35 Aldgate High Street London Jan : 27 th : 1807 . My dear Cousin , It was my intention , independently of your most kind letter just received , to write to you by this Post , to communicate the afflicting intelligence a letter from my Father brought me , yesterday -- the death of my dear Mother . As my poor Father has no one with him to make this dreadful communication , you might perhaps not immediately receive it : -- I fear , as it is , the papers will be your first informers . However , I was determined to lose no time . My Father wrote to me on the 13 th : , saying that my poor dear Mother was in a deplorable state from a confirmed Asthma , which baffled medicine , and that she was sent by her Physician , to Dawlish in Devonshire , on account of the purity of the air ; but that letter , from its going first to the Hill Top , I did not receive till Saturday last , and yesterday brought me the fatal one I have mentioned . She expired on Thursday last , the 22 d : , but six days after her arrival at Dawlish . The cause of her death , it seems , was , water upon the Chest . I need not tell you that am I in the deepest affliction ; for , to a heart like yours , it is unneceſsary to observe , that no circumstances can blunt the pang of nature for the loſs of a Mother . My poor Father 's situation , too , is dreadful . He is at Bath . I have written to entreat him to let me go to him for a little while , to break his dreadful miserable solitude . Whether he will agree to it , I do n't know ; but I am sure you will think I did no more than my duty , in making the offer . It is a great mercy that this blow did not reach me in Herefordshire ; for but as , were it not for the soothings of friendship , I think , after all I had already suffered , it would have extinguished me . A short time after I wrote to you last , I was so ill , and so low , that Mrs : Mann , who is settled in an excellent house here , insisted on my taking up my abode in it , at least till I got better , that I might have her nursing , and be within immediate reach of aſsistance , should I want it . I was easily persuaded , and have been with her these three weeks -- I have not been able as yet , to see one friend besides those I am with , not even my Sister ( who contrary to my expectation , is in town ) ; but was beginning to get considerably better , when this shock threw me back again . Your letter , my dear Cousin , was eleven days in reaching me , on account of those vile Croſs-Posts . I can not tell you how much I am obliged to you for it . Your warm interest in what concerns us , is particularly gratifying . I was so ashamed of that long epistle all about ourselves , that I was near burning instead of sending it . However , I am now glad it went . I did not even leave myself to ask after your health , so far from answering any questions -- therefore , before I proceed any further , I will hope that you have entirely lost the cough you complained of . To answer your questions -- my eldest niece is Lady Louisa Rodney -- she is at Ceylon with her husband , who has a good employment there . Ly : E : B : and her husband are in embarraſsed circumstances , already -- not entirely , however , from improvidence ; but partly from diminution of his Barbadoes receipts . I have not heard of any difference between the Husbands and Mother . -- I see I need not caution you to be totally ignorant of my affairs to my Father , should he ever mention them to you . Nothing has gone wrong with my B : , whom , I suppose , you mean by “ a certain young man ” . 'T is best keep as smooth as poſsible , I believe . Your kind suggestions for the advantage of my dear friend in D . are very wise ones , and shall be considered . He stands well with the D . & Dſs . ; but whether they will be of any material use , I ca n't say . -- Pray give my kindest love to Mr : Dickenson and my Cousin , Louisa ; and believe that I shall never forget the kindneſs you have shewn me . The young man wrote since I came to town , proposing a visit to the Hill Top ; so , if I do n't go to B . I must receive him on my return . Adieu , dearest Cousin -- ever your obliged and affectionate J : H . P.S . Mrs : Mann retains her name , having married her Cousin . I was longing to hear from you , & should soon have written had I not had this sad neceſsity for doing so . Mrs : Dickenson Leighton House . Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire .
