My Dearest I have a Distreſs which I beg you to help me out of ; when I come to the Q . House , I never but the 2 first times had the Page to open the Door or announce me ; the last time I waited quite in a Fright , hearing the Music in the outward Room , & not knowing whether I ought to open the Door myself or not ; at last Ly : Weymouth came , & opened the Door & went in before me -- now pray tell me , if there is no Lady in waiting what am I to do -- & how shall I do , if there is no Page to mention my being come . Pray my Dr : tell me this & oblige Yr : Affte : PD I hope to see you there = I design to bring & shou 'd I bring my knotting ? -- Miſs Hamilton S t : James 's
