Saturday Oakford 4 Sepr 13 Miſs Parkin came home to dinner on Wednesday looking very blooming & I was happy to see her in such good health James was gone out with a Mr. Dayvy the Clergyman of Bampton a person who was much esteemed by the late Mr. Parkin -- he has obligingly lent me a good old Pointer . Mr. D . is a great Fisherman -- Mr. D . went home in the Evg when it rained very hard -- Thursday -- We went out a shooting -- a Mr. Bere pronounced commonly Bear -- joined us wh- two indifferent Dogs -- he is the young man for whom James holds a Living -- We only found 4 Birds . I got a Shot & miſsed -- The Corn is not ripe upon these hills & is uncommonly late this Year -- So that Shooting here is out of the question at present -- We had a hot walk & rather tiresome -- After dinner I went down to the River about a Mile & half from here & had very good sport in fishing -- There is a beautiful River meandering there a most enchanting Vale & the Sides of the hills covered to their Summit with wood -- James laments grievously that I was not here on Friday when their was a Stag Chase & the Stag was found within a Mile of this place -- There is a great many wild Deer in this immense chain of Woods that are hunted at this Season & the Chase is commonly attended by 100 or 150 Horsemen & the hills covered wh- Infantry to see & hear the Sport for the Echo from the Concert of a large pack of Hounds is very exhilarating -- I understand that the Stag before he leaves Cover himself endeavours to drive out the Ladies belonging to his Harem & selfishly tries to secure his lordly majority -- at this Season the Hinds are not hunted as they have young ones -- On monday I am to partake of this Sport as the Hunt meet 7 miles off very luckily as I wish to see a pecularity of this Country -- Friday -- After breakfast James & I set out for Tiverton 9 miles from home -- just as we were going Mr. Dayvy called & good humordly went wh- us & aſsisted James in pointing out the beautiful Skylarks to me -- We rode thro the Woods & in many places the Vistas are like Enchantment -- Nothing can be be more beautiful . A Road is now making along this Valley which will be nearly flat all the way from here to Exeter & on the other side up the vale to -- two miles -- commanding this beautiful Scenery -- the Hill from the river to this place will be mended -- it is at present rather steep & so & the road covered wh- leaf stems -- We went to Tiverton on one side of this valley & returned on the other -- We saw the old Church at T . There is an Altarpiece by Cosway -- the Angel appearing to Peter , a good picture -- the outside of the Church is ornamented wh- carved work & a great many Ships with Coats of Arms -- Adjoining the Church Yard is the remains of an old Castle & the family Seat of the Carews & about a mile from the town I was shown the house where More Carew joined the Gypsies -- The school at T . is upon a large Establishmt . there are 180 Boys all boarded in the House -- Whilst our Horses were feeding we walked -- J . & I to the Hays at Collinpriest ½ mile from the Town -- Mr Hay & Ly Mary were out -- At Collinpriest I had a specimen of Devonshire Honesty -- I bought a pound of Gunpowder & tendered a two pound Note -- the Shopkeeper who is to be the Mayor & a temporary dispenser of Justice took out a handful of notes & in the middle picked out one & gave it to me -- I observed it had seen service , as it was very dirty & torn , but I thought it was selected for me as a Bank of England Note in lieu of the Country Banks wch- paſs here -- We went to another Shop to buy a chip Hat & I gave the Note the man said he had no change -- however he went out to procure it & on his return requested I would change the Note as it was a forged one -- So James & I packed off to his approaching Worship s & I desired him to change the Note when he turned to a Boy in the shop & said -- “ Did not I ask you before where you got this Note ” which shewed that he knew he was paſsing a bad Note & was guilty of forgery in giving it to a Stranger -- Just as we reached home Mr. Bere joined us and dined with us -- After dinner James insisted on my going a fishing as I had said I would & in Mrs . & Miſs P . walked with me to the River I only caught 3 as they were not in the humour to take the fly -- I have not had such a ride for some Years as this day -- it seems odd for me to talk of a ride of 20 miles -- & I saw such a Dog . Oh how Louisa wd- have exclaimed what a beauty -- Moses is not to be compared to it -- At T . there is a family of Dickinsons who are rich & Sir -- Duntze I found a defect in my Rod & paid a Man in Town ( the greatest coxcomical puppy I ever met with something like Mazin Esqr ) too much money for the repair of it & when I came to use it I found he had charged me for doing Nothing to it -- Mr. Dayvy said he would send me two Rods for my loss -- He is a good humored man a good Edition of James Lord -- the very worst preacher in England -- uses z for s on all occasions & what is very singular he can read any book but the Scriptures very well -- Saturday we had a great deal of Rain last Night -- Whilst we were at breakfast the two rods came from Mr. D . They are made on a better principle than mine & have skrews to fasten the joints -- I shall go a fishing by & by but shall wait first till the old Lady comes from Tiverton as I hope she will bring me a letter from You -- The great exercise this week agrees with me very well & I never was better in my life -- Mr. P . has just shown me a fine Collection of useful & ornamental China -- It is a very comfortable House -- a good Drawing & Dining Room a large paſsage & large Servts . Hall another Sitting Room & a very pretty Garden -- It is now settled that James & I set out on Tuesday next , I am Miſs P .
