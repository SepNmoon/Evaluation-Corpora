My ever dearest , dearest , dearest Sister Friend , I will take but little notice for ye . present at least of yr . last Note , you shall have a full & thorough answer to it on T—— M—— As to what I have to inform you have of I think it will astonish you very much . Parts of yr . Letter charmed me very much & parts had very much ye . contrary effect . Ye confidence you expreſs in it for me delights me very much , as I promised solemnly to lay every secret of my heart open to you , & to let you inspect my Soul heart & mind , open to yr . inspection I shall ever abide by it , as I hope I ever shall by any thing I promise you . Now to begin you remember I related to you a conversation to you ye other day which paſsed between Mſ- F—— & myself , which I aſsured her I wld .. not mention however as You are my dearest Friend upon earth , & as I freely promised not to conceal any thing from you , I related to you what paſsed between us , but not ye . whole , I will therefore tell you ye . rest after ye . aforesaid conversation was at an end she turned round to my B—— & asked him if she might trust me , he said he saw no reason why she shd .. not . she then asked him if I shd .. not be offended , he said he believed not , & that as I did not appear to be offended with what she had already told me , he did not ſuppose I shd .. be so with what she was now a going to say , she then desired me in ye like manner as she did before not to mention what she was to tell me , I made her ye . like aſsurance s I did before , which she construed into my pledging my honor wh .. I never did accordingly she then began with telling me she had drawn a d——d Characature of my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend with a Toad in her mouth . what cd .. be her meaning in so doing I know not . However she told me she wld .. go & fetch it & shew it me together with some others , however I let my Brother go & admire them alone , for I wld .. not go not only not to see ye . dearest friend in ye World I have , not only abused & scoffed at , but also ridiculed . I cld .. n ot cld .. not cld .. not bear it , was I therefore to countenance every thing against you of whatsoever kind , for were I , it wld .. be striking a Pognard into my very Vitals . I then heard nothing more of these hateful Characatures till I returned home when my B—— told me that she had shewn him two , ye one of which was yrs . & ye . other of her Cousin L C—— F . That they were both whole Lengths , that yrs . was not like in ye . smallest degree in ye . face , but only in ye . air of ye figure , as for ye . other nothing cld .. be liker & that it was taken all to pieces in another place . Here this affair rested till to day when to my great astonishment yr . Meſsenger was sent for by her , & after having engaged him under a promise she sent what wa is inclosed , rather I suppose to make her peace with me on yr . account as she supposes fancies she has offended me notwithstanding I had ye politeneſs to aſsure her I was not in ye . least so . My astonishment is not to be conceived upon rec my receiving this Note from her , I was then asked what answer was to be given , whether I did not rather chuse to write one , I said no , & that I was very much obliged to ye . Lady & shld .. certainly abide by what I had said , this I thought was a fully sufficient answer , supposing you had no very good opinion of this Lady before , I think this is sufficient to settle it , she th ere wants to frame an excuse for ye . ſtep she has taken , & therefore says it was extorted from her . When I trust this to you , I know it will be buried in yr . bosom to all eternity . I have not at present time enow to draw ye . Portrait I promised however you may depend upon it I will do it ye . first opportunity I can find , & with all ye sincerity openeſs & frankneſs that is in ye . power of human nature . The reasons you gave for yr . gravity are fully sufficient to satiſfy any . I feel much for that unhappy Man , for I can easily conceive what he is sensible of by what I ſuffer myſelf , for what can be more terrible , than to be desperately doatingly , & paſsionately in love , with an object that highly deserves such an attachment , & then not to be able to gratify that paſsion what situation upon Earth can be more dreadful or more irksome . Can you really have that sincere friendſhip for me which you pretend , if you wish me to break off that friendship , wh .. you well know constitutes ye . whole happineſs of my life . You told me once before you knew it was in vain to propose it me to me now , & I hope it ever will be so . What a mean opinion must you conceive of me if I was so easily & hastily to yield up that which I have been so long laboring to attain . Never mention this subject I conjure of you , to me any more . You must know how sincerely I am attached to you , that I wld .. lay down my life to be of service to you , to give I can not you can not can not part with yr . friendſhip it is dearer to me than life itself you say you have given it me , that I am worthy of it , that I have yr . esteem , that you have descovered many good qualities , among numberless weakneſses , such is ye situation of human Nature , it is impoſsible for any man to be quite perfect . But I ſhd .. not have gone on in this diſsertation , it belongs to ye . Portrait which I have promised soon to send you , & which I will ye . first moment I find time . I will also consider over those parts of yr . Letters which you say I have artfully avoided mentioning , believe me my friend , I use no art with you I deal with you as frankly & openly as is in my power & as you yrself must be sensible of . I will mention one thing more & I have done . It is very probable you & I may meet tomorrow Evening , if we do , do not I entreat of you treat me with that coldneſs you had did ye . other Evening make no difference between my Brother & me , treat us in ye same open manner you used to do . I own in private I have no reason to complain of you , I know you are really my Friend , but such are ye . strict paterns ye Warmth of my friendship have inspired me with that I do not for like even for a moment not to be treated with equal returns . For ye last time let me aſsure you , for you will greatly hurt me by doubting any longer ) that my love , affection & friendship for you will never cease but with my life , & Yr .. truly ever attached Palemon toujours de même Youll think I am grown awkward scribbler . ... Adieu , Adieu , toujours chère . P.S . This was written very late last Night after all ye . House were to re tired to rest , however I cld .. get none until ye entire confidence , frankneſs , and openeſs with which I deal with you & hope ever ſhall . I own ye . imputation of deceit stung me a little too , I wld .. not conceive that I wld .. any body moſt especially yourself , Oh no , I know of at least I hope that ye . good opinion you say you have conceived of me will aſsist in clearing me of all such imputations . Tell me in Yr . next I entreat of you that you will ever continue to esteem me as yr . friend & to treat me as such during yr . life , what makes me reiterate this entreaty , is that I thought notwithstanding yr . Letter began by calling Friend , ye manner in which you spoke of me shewed that I had done something to forfeit so sacred , dear , & affectionate an appellation . Adieu , My friend , my friend , my friend May Guardian Angels preserve you . It is ye . wedding day & therefore I think we shall meet .
