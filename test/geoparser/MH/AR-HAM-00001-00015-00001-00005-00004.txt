My dear , How is your cold ? to day -- what a diſsappointment to me , your not coming yesterday -- I did not know it till I went to dinner . What an age since we have met -- What have you been about -- I have remained some Evenings with my Fr . whose spirits are bad -- I think him otherwise very indifferent & this make me very uneasy -- Bell too who is going to Almacks & is not so well as she ought to be , gives me much uneasineſs . I have been twice to the Play with the Queen -- once to the Opera -- This is the Sum of my engagements since we met Ly Strafford s Death put off Ly Buckingham s -- so that we went no further than Ly Somer 's where we danced a few Dances what do you do Sunday -- shall we meet after 8 -- I am engagd till then -- come to me after Mr Pulteny s CMG
