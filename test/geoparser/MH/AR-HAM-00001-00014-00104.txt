Queens Lower Lodge ye 16 th October 1787 I return you many thanks my Dear Friend for your very kind enquiries which I red this Morning , I have been very ill ever since the beginning of July , & have been absent above two Months as Dr Turton said change of Air was absolutely neceſsary I returned here Ten days ago , & am thank God much better but tho have still some remains of Pain in my Side , but as I have lost the Fever , with care , I have great hopes I shall by degrees regain the first of all Bleſsings Health , but I am not so strong as you remember me , nor equal to do half the duty , but the Queen has been & is very indulging to me , & I do nothing that fatigues me , indeed Her Majesty was so gracious as to wish me to be absent till the latter end of this Month , but I desired to return , & I have no reason to repent it for the Weather has been so mild that I am vastly better then when I came -- I am very glad to hear your Sweet little Girl has been inoculated , for I can not help being a Coward , & think it a great Bleſsing when the Small Pox is happily over , every day now she will grow more entertaining , & I doubt not her being pleasing , as I am sure you will not spoil her -- I beg you will give my Comps to Mr Dickenson & believe me Ever my dear Mrs Dickenson Sincerely Yr MCGoldsworthy Octr . 16 th . 1787 Miſs Goldsworthy
