Buxton June 18 th - 1773 It is My dearest Mary the greatest ſign imaginable of my most ſincere regard Love & friendship for you that I now sit down to write you as for four days past I have actually been so ill with the Water that I have not been myself and am at present so low that absolutely nothing would keep me here but the hopes of hearing from you before I set off for Scotland , in short the Waters do not agree with me this year & I am reſolved immediately upon getting a letter from you to set off for home but shall not till I hear from you abt- Your motions to Kent & abt , both Mrs- Hamilton & your health as believe me I have nothing more at heart than that both should be as well as I wish You . Col Litchfield is here but the Kitten and her Father are at his house & he expects to to find them there when he returns from what I understand , by which time you 'll be gone to Margate so wont have much of her company this ſummer . You dont mention in yours whither the News papers comes regularly or not , nor do you mention whither you have read Byrom 's poems or not which I wrote you I was to send you & would have done it before had I had an oppertunity tho I do think them as bad as any thing I have read to get so great a Character , in short I dont think they are worth ſending unleſs it be for the first Pastoral which you 'll find in the 8 th Vol . of the Spectator , but such as they are , are at my dearest Girl 's service had they been better she wd have had them of course so there is no fault of mine as it shall always be my study to do every thing in my Power to oblige so very amiable a Wa rd as I have , and wish most sincerely every Guardian had the ſame reaſon to be contented with his Ward as I have than indeed it would be a pleaſure & not a Pain to be a proper Guardian but My dearest Girl I flatter my self at the ſame time was every Guardian to take the ſame method & have the same regard , Love , & affection , for their Ward without any self interest , their Wards would turn out better than they com̄only do -- what Pleaſure would it give me to oblige you with ye discription of our Babilonians was I either in spirits or able at preſent to do it , in short I have not spirits to put my hand in my pocket to take out Yours to anſwer otherwiſe I would say ſome thing to Mrs- Rogers but as I am reſolved only to wait Your anſwer & drink no more water this year I hope both she & Mrs Hamilton will believe me most Sincerely theirs & I make no doubt but my dearest dear es t Mary will excuse the shortneſs of this especially as I give her my Honor that I know no body I would so ſoon write too & who is likeways upon Honor my only female correspondant except Lady Napier and My Sister that I have , nor do I love any of them more than I do my Dear est Ward Remember me mo st affctly- to yr- Mama & I hope I need not ſay My Dear e st Girl how much I ever will & shall be yours I have got a dozen of franks from Sir P. Warrender derected for you , one I now send
