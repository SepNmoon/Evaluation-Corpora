Bristol Monday Night Think of the surprise I felt at reading your letter , and think of the pleasure I shou 'd have felt but for a circumstance the most vexatious the most tormenting -- To morrow morning as ever is , and many hours before you will receive this I shall be , Alas , on my way to London ; -- Only think of your coming at the precise moment of my departure ! was ever such a cruel contretems ? I am out of all patience at the thoughts of at . I expect to be in London early on Wednesday when I shall take care to repeat all your fine things to Mrs. Garrick , at least as far as my jealousy will give me leave . Pray tell my sweet Friend I really thought it an amazing time since I had heard from her ; and not knowing where you were I cou 'd not write to her . I shall set out on my dreary journey in a few Hours . My youngest Sister ( who I have a great notion you will like ) is a fellow Sufferer with yourself , and an Annual visitor to the Bath Waters ; She will be obliged to go in about a Week , and I shall send her to call on Mrs. D . that I may have the satisfaction of knowing more particulars about her than I shall be able to come at by other other means .
