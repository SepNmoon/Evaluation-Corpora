My dear Sir , Mrs. Mann left me on Saturday the 21 st . of July & had in charge a letter from me to you together with your marriage Settlement , which I have long since understood cou 'd be of no further use , as you had made a subsequent arrangement ; my motive in returning it to you was perfectly innocent , but as you have taken no notice of my letter , I fear it has either not been receiv 'd , or that you have taken this transaction differently from what was my meaning . After having exhibited such uncommon instances of friendship and attachment to me on the late afflicting occasion , I shoud abhor myself , cou 'd I have so soon been capable of forgetting my obligations to you and Mrs. Dickenson ; I therefore wish to be relieved from my anxiety upon this subject ; in addition to my present distre≈øs I can ill bear the suspicion of having acted improperly towards Persons who have so much claim to my esteem , I remain My dear Sir Your faithful humble Servt . Frederick Hamilton N o . 1 Brock St . Bath August 19 th . 1810 . John Dickenson Esqr . 49 . Welbeck Street Cavendish Square London single Mr Frederick Hamilton to Mr Dickenson Aug . 19 1810
