Wilton Lodge 19 th . Janry- 1795 . My Dear Sister , As you did not chuse to to answer my Queries about the Settlement in any decent time , I took it for granted that it was executed in a manner satisfactory to Yourself , & accordingly it was with all due formality deposited in my Charter Chest N o . 2 , where it now reposes along with my Last Will & Testament , & other Companions of the same sort . When I executed my Marriage Settlement in London the Trustees were made Sign & Seal , as well as Maria & Myself , and two Witneſses were thought neceſsary , & that occasioned my puzzle . Hitherto , we have had a most delightful Winter , but it now begins to threaten to shut up our Roads and my Snow Boots are now airing at the fire , my Snow Shoes having proved ineffectual . My good Genius has , however , proved leſs asleep than usual , as I arrived at home from Northumberland , acroſs Carter Fell , the day before the Snow made its appearance . It may be proper to explain to You , ( as though You are of the Blue Stocking Society Yet you may not be perfectly acquainted with all the Geography of this Island ) that Carter Fell is one of the highest of the Cheviot Mountains , which have been celebrated in Song . As you know , I do not particularly amuse myself with running about visiting as You do , your intellects may not serve You to discover what could have induced me to escape from home leaving my Wife behind me . But , that no bad consequence may arise from your Curiosity not being gratified , I will for once be Gracious , & inform You . Last October my Son William was Eight Years old , & having been , by his Mother s indulgence , permitted to do as he pleased during my absence these two last Summers , the Young Gentleman was in some danger of relapsing into that Barbarity & ignorance , from which , it had cost me much pains & trouble originally to extract him . Determined , if poſsible , to prevent this in future , I have placed him with a Clergyman at Ovingham , on the Tyne , who takes only ten Boys , and has the Reputation of being an Excellent Master , grounding his Scholars remarkably well in the Latin Grammar , and bringing them forward in such a manner as to qualify them to enter the higher forms in Great Schools , with credit to all parties . His terms are Thirty Pounds pr Ann . for Bed , Board , Washing & Instruction . They Boys are well fed , & each has a separate Bed , with white Dimmity Curtains & white Cotton Coverlid . I found every thing so perfectly neat & clean , that I returned home satisfied that William would be well taken care of in every respect , and more than half in Love with his Master 's Wife who is both handsome , & rational , which , in these days , is not very common . I remained a week in the Neighbourhood of Ovingham to see how the Gentleman took to his Master , & when I paid my last Visit to him , found him so contented & happy , that he refused returning Home with Me . My stay here , will be I hope till the 6 th - of March , when most unwillingly I must go back to my Troops at Liverpool . They poſseſs much of my good Will , but yet , there are attractions here , which I can not help preferring to the Dignity of the Parade . I shall be glad to see the Lancashire Fencibles , who as the Descendants of Witches , must be superior to anything we have among Us , your Witches being called Beauties , but I do not recollect that Macbeth 's acquaintances were said to poſseſs any personal Charms . Pray say all that is kind to Mr. Dickenson in my name , & if he is charitably inclined , he will give me Credit for much regard for him , though I do not make strong profeſsions . Return Louisa her Kiſs with Interest , & when we meet , I will repay you on Demand . My civilities to Miſs Morrison . Maria joins in wishing everything good , to You & Yours , with your faithful friend & Affectionate Brother Napier . My Brats are all well . Mrs= Dickenson Birch Hall Manchester By Carlisle .
