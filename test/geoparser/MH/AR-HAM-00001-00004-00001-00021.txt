Dear Miſs Hamilton I receiv 'd the favor of yours of the 9 th . of March some time ago ; I am extremely sensible of your goodneſs to me in taking part in so kind a manner in my interests If Ld . S_t has not been more candid in his publick transactions than in his conduct to me , his dismiſsion will not give cause of much regret . By a letter I receiv 'd at least a year ago from Ly . S . , wrote by Ld . S——t 's particular direction , he disapproves of what he had not only approved but even corrected him self , I mean my Memorial , which he meanly recommended it to me to apply to you to find a proper person to present it ; in short in that letter in many unmeaning expreſsions of regard he declined giving me any aſsistance whatever , as Ecclesiastical Preferments , to use his own words , were not in his department . His opinion upon the subject you was so obliging to consult him , is equally frivolous & unsincere he had better have spoke out at first , that he had no real regard for Ly . S . as that being the case , I cou 'd have no claim upon him , which is the construction I must put upon the matter . I expect to be in London by the 10 th . of May next , where I mean to stay but a very few days , and then proceed on my journey to Geneva , that we may arrive there before the great heats come on . If by chance you cou 'd procure me a letter of recommendation to any respectable Family there , it might be of much use to me , as I wou 'd not chuse to depend entirely upon the acquaintances that I have already there . I believe there are some very respectable Persons connected with that Country in the Family with you . There are some preliminaries of some difficulty to settle before my Preferment can be surrenderd , a word , too well understood in these days , which if they are not agreed to , I am determined to keep it in my own hands ; all this will be explain 'd when we meet . I have pleasure in the thoughts of showing you my Children , and hope you will think them objects well deserving my whole attention . I hope my Daughter Jane will be more fortunate than her Sister , she has a good understanding with excellent principles , the best foundation for a polish 'd education for which she poſseſses every requisite talent . When I appointed Mr. Balfour to be my Agent in Scotland , I gave him directions to be punctual in making your annual Remittance which I conclude he will always do at the same time that he sends my yearly Rent , which I generally receive in the month of Feby . , nor can the Tenants be brought to make their payments sooner . What changes the great revolutions in the Administration will produce here time will show , and I shall be satisfied to hear of them at a distance ; the subject of of Politicks is particularly unsatisfactory at this time , and I observe you always avoid it . My views are now much contracted , & all expectations being at an end I shall at least be exposed to fewer disappointments . My spirits are by no means broken and no one can enjoy agreeable society more than I do , but the kind of society that I mean , I do not find here . Pray remember me to the Grevilles , you have never mention 'd Ld . Cathcart , I am disposed to think extremely well of him . Adieu My Dear Miſs Hamilton believe me ever Your very faithful & Affece . Uncle Frederick Hamilton Sackville Street April 2 d . 1782 . P.S . I shall be at some Hôtel for the few days that I shall stay in London
