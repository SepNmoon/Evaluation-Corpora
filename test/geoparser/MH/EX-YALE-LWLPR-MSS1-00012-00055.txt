Strawberry hill aug . 25 . 1790 . Mr Dickenson 's present was very kind , my dear Madam , and I give him a thousand thanks for it , especially as a mark of his remembrance & friendship . The Birds arrived perfectly sweet , & to me were a great novelty , who never saw growse-pouts before : I took them for a beautifull new-invented sort of Partridge , & wished to bring them to life again , rather than to eat them . Your letter is still kinder , & as far as gratitude & return of attachment can poſsibly go , I am not unworthy of it . I am sorry you give me such good reasons , that I dare , not only not hope to see you soon , but am even forced to approve your reasons , but and to admire you for them . Indeed when do you not act with sense & propriety ? & when you have made so excellent a choice , can a true friend wish you to deviate from the line of conduct that so much becomes you ? & which may interfere with some kind sentiments but does justly contribute to your solid happineſs -- I will rest on that thought , & only hope I may live to a day when your Duty & convenience may fall in with my satisfaction . Were I of a travelling age how gladly shoud I accept your most obliging proposal of making you a visit ! & kiſsing your pretty Louisa ! -- but my clock is on the stroke of 74 -- & after so many years of gout , have not I cause to be content & thank god that I can creep about my own small garden -- coud I call on you & Mr Dickenson , my dear Madam , it woud not be in my way to Buxton . I do not beleive there is in the whole map of Medicine a fountain so salutory as my own temperance & regimen , and cold system . They have preserved my paper frame to this extended age , I am certainly better than I was three years ago , & tho I have frequent parentheses of gout , they are not only short , but in a manner without pain , so that the worst hurt they do me is to confine me -- & That now is a small Evil . In short I woud not be cured of my gout , if I coud ; I do not want to dance like Lord Barrymore with Delpini -- nay , I shoud probably have some other Illneſs , which I shoud not Understand so well how to manage -- & besides old people who have no complaint , are mighty apt to think that if forty or fifty years have not lamed them , they have remained at a stand & are still twenty -- mercy on us ! do but think what follies are committed by ancient gentry that fancy themselves young ! -- but I have talked too many lines on myself , & will now answer your questions . Poor dear Mrs Vesey is exactly in the same state of childhood she was , & certainly will never be leſs so . One can only wish now that she was restored to happineſs thro the only door by which She can paſs to it , & which her blameleſs benevolent life makes us presume She will enjoy . Mrs Garrick I beleive is still at Bristol , whither She went in a fright at the beginning of the Summer . In the single letter I have received from Miſs More , She told me her friend was better . So is She herself , & tormenting herself , more to mend her spotleſs Soul than her Constitution -- one of her nostrums indeed is an excellent one , which is always labouring to do good to others . Miſs Boyle called a fortune of five thousand a yr . is really Miſtreſs of half of it . The other half is contested by Lord Shannon by some informality in the poor Brother 's Will , or by Mrs Walsingham 's presuming on her own title to it without the right . I have heard both causes aſsigned & know not which is the true . Miſs Boyle is intoxicated with her Release & laughs & talks & gallops & drives & dances from night to morning & from one end of the isle tother -- yet to the last moment of her mother 's life never relaxed one moment in attention ; & since , with all her torrent of spirits has done nothing to be blamed , & behaves with great regard & propriety to all her Mother 's old friends . Both her real & nominal fortune have a cohort of Suitors , but I hear of no preference She Shows ; & as She has had the sense , against her Mother 's advice , to admit no female to live with her ( who woud soon recommend a Male ) I hope She will not fling , away herself & her liberty & felicity on one of our Sex , without knowing whether he deserves her or not ; for that rare Clan , the Dickensons , are not fortune-hunters . Our early post allows me to say no more , tho I own I was happy to seize this moment of conversing with you again , for I am with the most sincere & cordial regard and esteem my dearst .
