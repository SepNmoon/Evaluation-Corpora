Stanley House 1 of August 1788 my Dear Honble . Mrs. Murray I am too vain perhaps , but judging of a Friends heart by my own , am very loth to imagine because they are silent , the old adage is verified , out of sight , out of mind : but am willing to supose they are taken up with something more material than writing : but am sorry to find yours was owing to the fair Mrs. Dickinson 's pains : believe me I thought your silence very long , but hope you will make amends and give me the pleasure of hearing soon that you are all well , and that I shall in future have a better Correspondent : for tho ' your young charge will every day have a longer claim upon your time yet remember I was honor 'd with your Friendship before she was born -- I am much flatter 'd by the kind enquiries you make after my health which is now very good ; It was not so when last in London , and never having known what it was to be out of health made my friends think the more of it : and myself too I believe : but I was very good and did as I was bid , and by following good advice from Louisa and coming into this good air have the pleasure to tell you I am very well ; tho ' it has taught me to think as we grow old , we must expect sometimes to be sick -- Your picture of the Bon Ton is well drawn , and I am sorry to say very like , tho ' I am of opinion the World is much as it was , a certain proportion of Virtue & Vice always have prevail 'd , but fashon makes some ages more flagrant than others because they are more sincere -- for I shrewdly suspect our Great Grandmothers days were not much better than ours , the only difference from a reserve of Manner , a stiffneſs of the times characters were carefully hid , and of course there were greater cheats at present nobody has a right to complain , as I think it quite their own faults if deceived by apearances -- all our Friends are returned and I think our young ones much improved by their journey to London we spent a Week at Dunkeld and celebrated Doctor Douglas s birthday 's with fireworks and good chear -- after which we returned home and the Duke went to the Isle of Man with his two Uncles , the Duke of Atholl and Lord Tullibardine and a party of Gentlemen , from whence they all returned last Monday in good health , but had as much rain as we had here : Mr. Graham 's and Lady Jane were with us , part of the time ; and are now at Dunkeld she is a Sister of the Duke s -- and lives at Bath , as do Mr. Muirhead and Lady Charlotte -- I hope you continue to Excersise your pencil , we find great amusement my Sister has taken some preaty views in the great stile while my humbler pencil , makes a card or draws a flower ; there is a very good Botanic Garden at Perth ; from whence I have more flowers sent me than I can draw -- how amused the R . F . must be at Cheltenham the scene and country so new , hope it will do Amelia Murray a great deal of good but dont you think it a punishment , for His laughing so much at water drinking places ; to be forced to submit to go himself , and experience their virtue ? I should think he would from the nature of the Spring ; find very great benefit from it ; as well as the Princeſses -- supose it has been his scheme for the K . to sell his Estate in Yorkshire & purchase Oatlands -- the one was too far North to be agreable I imagine and the other is just enough for a Prince to amuse himself with , without gaining command or interest and is a beautifull spot within reach of court & c -- I supose in my next I may give you joy of a new cousin as her Graces apearance would make one supose its arrival not far off -- I have settled it to be a son there is daughters plenty and Dukes should have but few as it is so hard to provide for them . My Sister & good husband joyn with me in best wishes to yourself beging best compts to the Duke of York & remain Dear Mr. Dickenson s sincere and affectionate Friend Mrs. Dickenson at least 12 Kiſses to yr .
