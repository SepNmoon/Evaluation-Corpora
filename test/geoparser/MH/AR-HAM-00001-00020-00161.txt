Wilton Lodge 25 th - May 1801 . My Dear Sister , Being the most obedient Brother in the World , although I have not been here above Eight & Forty Hours , yet I fulfil your commands by announcing my own safety , and that of my Wife and Eight Children . A very jolly Company we Ten make around the Dining Table . At the same time I can not deny that the sounds somewhat remind me of a Story , I have read , in an old fashioned , antiquated Book , relative to the Tower of Babel . Such Society would not suit the delicate Nerves of fine folks , but as We do not aspire to any dignity above that of Rustick 's , we bear it tolerably well . At this very instant my hopeful Heir Apparent is spitting in the Flute , endeavouring to make it produce the Dusty Miller . He , however , is only a Paſsenger in this family , and in a very few days , he will be consigned to his Studies , under the care of a Clergyman near Edinburgh , for the purpose of making him comprehend what he has been labouring and idling over at Houghton . He is grown a fine stout , decent looking Lad ; poſseſses a tolerable share of capability ; without much desire of exerting it , well tempered , and free from any Vice , as far as I have been able to discover . One thing was certainly to his Credit . On leaving Houghton School , he had not a single debt , except one of five Shillings , which he informed me of , when he contracted it . This , I beleive , is seldom the case , at public Schools . The sight of Green Fields , and the Music of the Birds , make me ample amends for the loſs of Employment in attending on the affairs of the Nation . Not , that I am idle here , for I have been most busily , and perplexedly employed , in finding Places for a Cargo of large Books , just arrived from London , in my Library . After having consumed the whole morning in attempting to accommodate Twenty Folio Volumes ( Rymer 's Fœdera ) , my next operation was to inspect , and find fault ( for without doing so , my Authority would be lost ) with the Management of my farm , during my absence . I could not in conscience , however , abuse my Overseer very much , for it was in tolerably good order . I left Lady Warren on Tuesday last . Her arrival at home brought many painful recollections to her Mind . But , She was evidently better for removing from Town . I left her with a Mrs- Edge , a particular friend of hers , and by this time Lady Clavering will have gone out to her . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Maria joins me in best wishes to You , Mr. Dickenson , & Louisa . Remember me to my Countrywoman . Ever Your sincere friend and Affecte- Brother Napier Hawick , Twenty Sixth May 1801 Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier . 120 6 30 6 180 52 360 900 9360
