Dear Miſs Hamilton , We shall be rejoiced to have the pleasure of your company tomorrow to dinner ; and shou 'd have been happy to have had it in our power to have sent our carriage for you , but we are as yet unprovided with one , which will not be the case many days longer . Her Majesty is upon all occasions very gracious , but at the same time as her attentions are never without a meaning it must surely be very flattering to you to be so often the object of them I am Dear Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affecte . Uncle Frederick Hamilton Tuesday October 1 st . 1782 N o . 3 . S t . James 's Street .
