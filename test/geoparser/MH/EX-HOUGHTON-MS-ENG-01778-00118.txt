Hampton 12 . Janry . 1783 My dear Madam I was in Town for one day . I thought to have seen you , but hearing you were at a Friend 's house , I was afraid it might be improper . On my return hither I found such a letter as made it impoſsible for me to answer yours . It was from my Sister , and informed me of the death of the dearest and best of Fathers . -- I know you will pity me and forgive my not writing to you before , and my saying nothing to you now , for my spirits are still weak , and this is the first line I have written . We shall not come to Town for some Weeks . I long to see you .
