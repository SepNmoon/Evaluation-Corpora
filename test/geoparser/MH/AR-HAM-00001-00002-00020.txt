7 July 1789 N o . 18 Queen 's Square Bath 7/ This day I spent at home -- 8 / Sir Robt . Herries & Mr. Sackville sent me an invitation to dine with them to day , & left their names , at 4 I went to them & dined in company with Mr. Bowdler & 2 Miſs Kirkpatrick s with whom they lodge -- at 7 I called at the Milnes , where I heard that the old Lady was ill -- I left my name at ye- Isted 's , & went to Mrs. Rundell s & staid there a little time from thence to Mrs. Hartley 's where I found an aſsemblee consisting of Ly Mary & Miſs Blair , Mr . & Mrs. Farmer , Mr . & Mrs. Vanbrugh Mr. Hartley Brother to Mrs. H & his young Wife , and Sir George Paul , & c & c Mrs. Hartley introduc 'd me in a friendly manner to her Brother , & always says when I leave her , “ and must you go so soon ” -- I staid about an hour & in my return home stopped for ½ hour at the Earle 's who returned yesterday -- I hear they set out for Spa in a Week -- as soon as I left the Earles I went into ye- Bath Today & yesterday we have had a great many heavy Showers 9/ at one oClock I called to inquire after Mrs. Milne 's who is very ill -- she complained of a Cold the last time I saw her -- I shd . be sorry if the old Lady was to die as I have taken a fancy for her -- She seemed so good humoured & so happy -- when I returned from my Walk I found Mr. Sackville here , who had brought a friend of his , Major Murray , to introduce to me -- he seems to be a polished well bred Man & Mr. S . speaks very highly of him -- he could not poſsibly have a better recommendation -- the Major is fixed in this house which I hope will be a pleasant circumstance to me -- I recd . a Letter from Ingles who has spent a week with Lady Fust -- he begins his Letter with “ Lose no time in going , where a polite reception awaits you ” & concludes with a description -- of the croſsroads to the mansion -- Major Murray Mr . & Mrs. Davies & I went to drink Tea at Dr. Clarke s -- a Comte Neuville his Lady & Daughter came there & c & c & c we returned at ten -- as we were settg out to go there , my heart beat at the postman 's rap & calling my Name -- I flew to him & found he brought me a Letter from my Love 10/ I do n't know how it happened that I shd . make the mistake of the Parade instead of the Square ; but I 'll vouch for the correctneſs of the direction youll find in this -- before I take notice of ye- Letter I 'll give you to days journal -- at 9 I recd . a Note from Mrs Rundell to desire my company to dinner to day instead of tomorrow I as I was engaged to the Isteds I promised to call at one on Mrs. R . however I made it in my way as I went to Herschell s & made her look grave as I was not very well this morng -- I believe I have an improper degree of delicacy on some occasions , & suppose that I might take Cold the day I took a Medicine -- on wednesday Evg I bathed which brought out all my Rhumatick pains & the Castor Oil havg had too strong an effect the day before -- I suppose might all together affect my nerves -- with the addition of as bad weather as ever was known , by way of a further digreſsion I must tell you that havg compared yr- Acct . of the weather with mine I find that when a general rain has commenced it has been nearly if not exactly at the same time at Taxal & Bath -- I did not stay 5 minutes with Mrs. R but went on to Herschell s , where I played for a full hour , and was much amused , I found my Spirits raised I shall now tell you very honestly , that if you had not known of my learning to play that I shd . undoubtedly have given up all thoughts o f r expectations of succeeding on that instrument -- I began seriously to despair -- but when I cald to mind how often you had expreſsed a wish that I cd . play upon some instrument I resolved to persevere , & am now happy to tell you that I believe the greatest difficulty is conquered -- I take out the base of a common tune now nearly at sight , & am begun to play Duetts after all , if I am to buy a tolerably good violoncello , you 'll be ruined & undone & I imagine will not trust me alone again -- I went to Bull 's Library for ½ hour where I met with dismal Accts . from France , and came home to dreſs & at 3 went to ye- Rundells -- I found Mr. R . in the Dining room , who met me with a long face to make enquiries about me as he said Mrs. R . had made him uneasy -- he recommended some thing for me to take to aſsist the operation of the Water , as he wrote it down I desired him to do it according to the due formalities with an R/ at the top & the initials of his name at the bottom , for in that case I could give him a fee , at which he laughed -- we had no squalling Brats at dinner -- & dined comfortably -- they have a relation with them who is wife to an officer in the Ruſsian Fleet -- I spent an hour or two very pleasantly with Mr. R . I got him into his profession where he was quite au fait -- I found afterwards that Mrs. R . had overheard a part of our conversation & charged me wth- secrecy , which diverted me inwardly -- at 7 I went to the Isted 's with a promise to return to the Rundells as they were to have some Musick -- I was very civilly received by the whole family -- little hopping Rose enquired after you in a friendly manner the sickly one was tolerably well to day & very agreeable -- Dr. Fraser & his Wife who is a very pretty woman & her Sister , who is exactly what I wd . wish to Louisa to be in the exterior -- She has very pretty features , a sweet countenance , fine blue Eyes & a delicate figure -- The younger Mr. Throgmorton came in soon after me , but did not recollect me -- Happening to mention your name ( which I do as seldom as poſsible ) he turned round to Miſs Isted to enquire who I was & immediately got up , took me by the hand & seated him self by me , I enquired about Bell Gunning 's match , & was informed that these Lascelles have very little fortune at present , as there are only 19 of them -- but they look forward to the Harewood estate -- dont you recollect when we are at Lord Hoptoun 's masked ball that I pointed out a young Man to you whose manner & general appearance was very like the Prince of Wales -- He is one of them , & is called Prince L—— from his aping the Prince -- they are looked upon as very gay young Men -- it was also said that Miſs G . was going to be married -- I could not hear the Gents . name -- I was told that he had a place under Government not Digby -- Mr. Throgm . spoke of George 's manners and his turning his B—— to the fire as great impertinence , & I could perceive that He does not like him at all -- Charles Rainsford was sat down to Cards & c -- I staid an hour and returned to the Rundells -- where I found Dr. Richmond playing up on a Clavicello -- a very curious instrument -- it is like a violoncello , with only 3 strings -- & is played upon with Keys for the left hand -- & the right uses the Bow nearly in the same manner as upon a violo . only this lies flat -- I staid an hour & in my way home left my Name at Henry Richmond I ought here to tell you that when Sir Robt . Herries called upon me he expreſsed his anxiety about Sackville 's taking his wife & Child into a country where civil contests are looked upon as inevitable & wished that I would take an opporty of of mentioning , as it were by accident , my fears for their safety -- He said , “ tho nothing could be so disagreeable to me as to go to Fr ance , yet if he will give up the Idea of taking Sir Robert with him & wishes for C ompany , I will set out tomorrow ” -- he is a generous good Crea ture -- Now for yr- Letter : as soon as I got up this morng . after I again r ead your Letter my dearest Girl & immediately wrote the following short Epistle to your Uncle -- He is yr- relation and you are the best of Wi f v es -- when a person wishes to serve another , the most friendly & delicate way is to come to the point at once , which is a proof that the heart is interested -- & I hope you will approve of what I wrote “ Dr . Sir -- I recd . a Letter by this days post from “ Ly H . in which she informs me of the inconvenience you are likely to sustain “ from the unavoidable delay of the execution of the Bond ; which gives me great concern -- I came here for the benefit of the waters , & dont find myself well enough at present to return into Cheshire or I would set out immediately -- If it shd . be neceſsary for you to make the purchase of a cornetcy for yr- Son before the Bond can be executed , I beg you will make use of a 1000£ of mine which I can procure for you on a very short notice -- I beg you will present my best Comps to Mrs. D & Mrs . & believe me to be Dr . Sir yr- obliged & faithful & c ” 11 I called at 10 on Miſs H . & Sir Robt . , & invited them to dine with me tomorrow which I know you will think is right -- this morng I sat down with a determination to finish this L . & send it off to day , but before I got thrō 10 lines it brot- on a headache which has continued all day -- I went thō through my Italian leſson which I shall understand tolerably well before I leave this place -- but this weather is the most unlucky circumstance for me , as I find it almost impoſsible to keep my self entirely free from Colds -- this day has bee rather pleasant , thō with several showers -- at 12 I went to Mr. Sackville ( you see what a simpleton you make of me ) -- & attempted to sing for ½ an hour -- at one Rauzzini came to me -- so that you may see I have not even time if the inclination was strong , to admit of my wandering thoughts -- but no Man in poſseſsion of such an inestimable treasure as I am , could ever forget his Wife even for a moment -- therefore I have very little merit in being faithful to you my dearest Mary -- I paid a visit to Herschel this morng & was graciously recd . -- She was at C.m when Mrs. M. Isted was there & is very positive that the Water did him no injury “ as he was as mad when he came there & when he went away ” She desired me to call again -- I always enquire after the King -- to day I had a bad Acct . -- ½ past 6 I went to Mrs. Millnes s -- there was a Dr. Fothergill there a favourite of Mr. Dawson s The rain prevented my leaving them time enough to go to Charlwood s as I intended , which was a disappointment to me -- The D r . preſsed me to come again on Monday which I promised to do -- he looks in perfect health & better than usual as his face is quite clear from pimples -- 12 I got a little cold last night in returng thrō the rain , but otherwise am very well -- Mrs. Hartley called upon me yesterday , when I was out -- I afterwards met him & Mr. Earle arm in arm -- he said “ he had called on me to enquire how I was , and to invite me to dine with them tomorrow as their stay was very short ” -- I made my excuses & thanked him for his friendly attentions to me -- I am very happy in my new acquaintance Mrs. E . -- he is one of the pleasantest men I ever met with -- he is lively good humored , sensible , well informed & extremely well bred -- he has lived a great deal amongst French Women , which creates a pliability of manners & attentions which become habitual -- where those charming qualities are not natural -- It has never ceased raining all morng I have been only once to the pump & the air is so damp that I durst not go to Church -- I will now take my leave of you , as I see you at this instant at dinner & the natural Vanity of my Sex induces me to think , that I see you heave a Sigh & whisper to yr- affectionate Heart “ How wouldst thou palpitate were my dear Husband to return to thee . ” Major Murray . 'not one word about Louisa ' -- is it poſsible ? -- God bleſs & preserve my dear Louisa -- & her charming Mother -- Adieu ma tres chere femme , toujours Votre Louisa Tell J.D . that the Corn in this Country looks very well , but the Hay is in a shockg condition ; a great deal uncut -- I heard yesterday that Mr. D . s complaints had terminated in a Drops y and that he was so much swolen that he had not be e moved for several days , & of course must now be no more .
