From J Dickenson Junr Bell Derby 17 Feby 1789 My dearest Mary Here am I arrived , at 3 oClock tolerably dry from the Knees upwards -- but below that point in a miserable plight indeed -- I should not have wrote to you to day , but to inform you of something that will call forth feelings of a different Nature -- That poor wretch Sir Hry Harpur is dead ' -- he died on Tuesday last -- & is to be buried on Saturday -- I am sensible that our dear friend Ly Frances will be in great distreſs Yet I can not help rejoicing that an End is put to the uncomfortable State in which She lived -- Kiſs our dear Child an hundred times for me -- Sweet little Creature how affectionate She is -- I still see her sitting in State with the pillow before her , & enjoying herself -- If it shall please God to bleſs her & me by sparing your precious Life -- She may grow up an Ornament to Society & an example of Excellence to her Sex -- and I live the happiest of Husbands I am Yours entirely And Most Affly JD Say every thing that is proper to the Tredrille party --
