Caldas Sepr . 5 th . 1781 My Dear Miſs Goldsworthy , No Packet being yet arrived , I have no Letter from you since the End of June . I wrote to you the 22 d of this Month an Enumeration of all the Letters I had wrote before , with those enclosed for their Rl Highneſses , wch . I will not here repeat , as I hope they have all long since been receiv 'd , thō I have not had the pleasure of hearing it . I must now proceed to tell you , what gives me great Satisfaction , that is , that we are upon the Point of leaving the Caldas , where Ld Winchilsea has so much benefited , that excepting an Increase of Strength , there is nothing to be wish 'd about him ; & in this particular he is so much mended , that he has determin 'd to accompany Me , as far home , as he may be allow 'd to go Northward , for it is still the universal Opinion , that he must paſs his Winter in a Southern Climate . This Idea which can only be accomplish 'd by returning by Land , has led me to determine against the Sea Voyage , which I own I dreaded , both as it disagreed so much with me before , & as the finding a proper Neutral Veſsel ready to Sail , so as to reach England before November , is very uncertain , added to the Apprehensions of going on board a Portuguese , whose Skill at Sea is not equal to the English . By Land no doubt it will be tedious , Expensive , and Inconvenient , but then it will be Sure , which one can never say of the Paſsage by Sea . Our Route will be from Lisbon to Madrid , from thence to Bayonne , & so to Ostend . As we shall only stop at some of the Principal Places in order to rest ourselves & refit for our Journey , it may not in point of time much exceed what the going by Sea , & waiting for a proper Veſsel to Sail might bring it to , therefore we think we shall certainly adopt that plan , & I flatter myself , by the End of November I may have the happineſs & honour of paying my Grateful Thanks & Duty to their Majesties for their Gracious Indulgence to me , & kiſsing the hands of all the dear Princes & Princeſses . indeed my Dear Miſs Goldsworthy I am quite overcome with the Pleasure this Thought gives me , & feel how Grateful I shd . be to Providence that has given so unexpected & happy a Conclusin to my ( at first ) dismal Undertaking . The Preparations for this long Journey , will take us some time , Paſsports must be got , Carriages bought , & a Thouſd . things that occur upon such Occasions , which will detain us some time at Lisbon , however at any rate I must have stopt there , to have an opportunity of paying my Duty to the Queen of Portugal , for whose Gracious Attentions to us , we are bound to shew every mar k of respectful Gratitude . There are no Court Days here so that She is always applied to , to name a day for receving those that ask an Audience & I understand she does not refuse to Lisbon till the beginning of October . I have my dreſs also to make for it , having as you may imagine brought nothing of that kind with me . As it will be the 5 th . of Octr . before you can receive this Letter , I beg you will be so good to write me an immediate Answer directed to me at Madrid Poste restante ( Via Ostende ) as I calculate it must meet me there where we are also in hopes of finding Mr & Mrs Graham , who are still at Porto , & intend wintering in the South of France . Adieu my dear , may every thing go on prosperously & happily with you all at Windsor , & may I ere long be the happy Witneſs of it . My Duty Affections Complimts . & c , & c you will dispose of as you know I wish & believe me ever my dear Miſs Goldsworthy most faithfully & Affly . Yrs C.Finch I suppose my next Letter you will expect to be in Spanish . Mrs Feilding begs her kindest Love to you . To Miſs Goldsworthy Queen 's House London ( Via Ostende ) Inglaterra
