Mr. Fisher presents his best Compliments to Miſs Hamilton , & begs she will do him the honour to accept the Drawing of Pevensea Castle . Mr. F . would have waited upon Miſs H . this morning , if he had not thought a visit would have been inconvenient to her , as he supposes she must be busied in preparing for the Drawing Room . Mr. F . flatters himself however , that he shall have the pleasure of seeing Miſs H . to offer her the Compliments of the Season , before she goes to Windsor . S t . James 's . Jan : 1 . 1782 .
