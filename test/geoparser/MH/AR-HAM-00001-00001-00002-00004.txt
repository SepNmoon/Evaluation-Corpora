Q . Lodge Windsor . 30 August . 1780 . My dear Miſs Hamilton . What can I have to say ? not much indeed ! but to wish You a good Morning , in the pretty Blue and white Room where I had the pleasure to sit and read with You the Hermit a Poem which is such a Favorite with me that I have read it twice this Summer , Oh what a blessing to keep good Company . very likely I should never have been acquainted with either Poet or Poem was it not for You . The season continues so fine that Our Terrace is constantly filled , as I do not partake of that amusement and am but a Spectator . all alone at times , a droll Idea started up in my mind which by any cleaver Person my be made much of , but with my way of thinking I thought it dangerous to indulge , what do You think it was ? well Madam it was comparing the Terraſse the Royal Terraſse with what .. ? Patience . with a Market Oh Fie upon the Queen . Now You know this Wicked thought of mine . and I promise You to have done with it for ever . and You promise me to keep it to Yourself . Every body belonging to You is gone in the country . exepting Mrs. Veesy . or Weasy . who is in this Neighborhood and come twice to Lady Causton in order to see the Royal Family upon the Terrace . I made her two Courtsies from the Window and was told that my politeneſs had almost thrown her down , I was sorry to find that I had been doing mischief . Adieu , this will be the last scrawl You will receive from me till we meet . Charlotte
