I am glad to take the Opportunity of Miſs Glover 's going to Bath , to write to you , my dear Mrs : Dickenson . -- I beg leave to renew my Congratulations to you on your Daughter , who I hope , continues well -- Pray , how soon do you mean to present her to us ? -- Miſs Glover is all impatience to see you , and the little Stranger , as well as Mrs : Glover -- I think the Excursion will be of great use to the former ; at least I hope so -- she has been but indifferent lately . We have had a good deal of Music this Winter , for which our Liking does not diminish -- 'T is very croſs of you , not to come among us , to hear some of it . I believe my Father told you what a Giant Robert was grown -- he comes home every Sunday , now that the Days are long enough for him to return to Kensington after Dinner -- so you may imagine , he perfectly approves of our Situation . You wish for an Account of the Plan of our House -- here it is -- The Front 50 Feet , looking to the South , with a small Court , parted off from the Street by an Iron Rail . The Hall 22- by 15- , with a large Window , and a Fire-Place : shut off from the back and best Stair-Case with a Door leading to each . After you get out of the Hall , you turn to the Right , which brings you to the Dining-Parlour , facing the South ; with three Windows -- the Chimney at the End -- The Dimensions , 30- by 22- and 14 Feet high . A Door out of that , leads you to a Back-Parlour , with a large Bow-Window -- 25- by 21- 14 Feet high . A Door out of that , leads to a small Dreſsing-Room -- & c. -- You go up a very handsome Stair-Case , not a winding one , nor lighted by a Sky-Light , but a straight Stair-Case , lighted by a large Window -- this Stair-Case goes no higher than the Drawing-Room Floor . You now come into an Anti-Room , 22 by 15- and 16 Feet high ; with two Windows looking to the South -- consequently to the Park . A large folding Door at the Side of this AntiRoom , lets you in a Drawing Room 30 by 22 16 feet high . A large folding Door at the Side of this Room , lets you into a back Drawing-Room , 25 by 21- 16 Feet high -- with a Bow.-Window . You go up a back Stair-Case to the Attics -- there are three Rooms to the Park , and two backwards , with the same Number of Garrets . There is a Kitchen out of the House , and most excellent Offices in the House , such as a capital House-Keepers Room , the same Size as the Back-Parlour , with a Servants'-Hall , Butler 's Pantry , and a Cellar that will do Justice to the cheap Claret we are told we are to have . Add to all this , the most magnificent View that can poſsibly be conceiv 'd , over the Park , Kensington Gardens , and the Surry Hills , and you will say my Father has been very judicious in the choice of his Situation -- and as to the Plan of the House , it is allow 'd to be the best calculated for comfortable habitation , that can poſsibly be -- at the same time , it has a most elegant , and Gentleman-like Appearance . I forgot to mention , that the best Drawing Room ( 30 feet by 22- and 16 feet high , ) has three Windows to the Park , and the Chimney at the end . If you are tir 'd with this long account , remember you ask 'd for it . Pray remember me to Mr : Dickenson -- and also , my Father and Mother , and Brother , who beg likewise to be remember 'd to you . I hope the time is not very distant when you will introduce the young Lady to us -- in the mean time I remain , with best Wishes to her and you , -- my dear Cousin , yours sincerely -- J : Hamilton . London March 20 th : 1787 .
