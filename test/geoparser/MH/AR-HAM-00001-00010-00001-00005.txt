Winchester Sept—— 11 th -- My dearest Miranda , Remember that you desired to hear from me , & this you know will furnish me with an excuse for sending you a dull Letter , indeed I have nothing new or agreeable to relate nothing worthy of Miranda 's attention ; but as there is scarcely any Bagatelle which I could not relate with pleasure to you may I not presume to hope that a trifle from me may be acceptable to you for my sake , & that pretty motto -- C'est l'Amitie qui donne le prix -- is more intelligible to you than to any one -- We are deeply engaged in musical Entertainments -- we have had heard two Concerts -- which I can not greatly commend , yesterday morning -- the Meſsiah was performed in the Cathedral -- but not in the Choir -- the performers were attentive & in a degree did justice to this sublime Composition -- I imagine it has never been heard in perfection -- since Handel conducted the Band -- I think you have not heard it -- I can aſsure you -- that you then have a pleasure of a superiour kind to experience , as I think I never heard any music which so elevates the mind -- there are in particular two of the Choruſses -- which have an astonishing effect -- & really seem to correspond with the idea of Milton , who was as sensible of the power of music as any -- There let the pealing Organ blow To the full voiced choir below In service high & in anthems clear , As may with sweetneſs thro ' mine ear Diſsolve me into extacies And bring all Heav'n before my eyes . John Milton , Il Penseroso . the echo aſsisted the effect of the music -- Mrs Parnel gained credit by singing one of the finest songs -- in a word the amateurs were pleased -- & if you are not an one of these I shall have tired you . Today we are to have an Oratorio in a room -- we were to have been this morn at eight at the Camp -- to see the 1 line drawn out , but unfortunately rain prevented us -- I think I ought not to regret it since it gives me leisure to write to you -- one -- & by this means I enjoy one of the sweetest pleasures of my life -- I recollect with pleasure the morning we spent at Kew . & which your society made as agreeable as short -- I wish to hear from you -- there was a Letter begun -- I hope you will not do me the injustice to deprive me of it , we shall stay here untill Wednesday -- when I am certain I shall leave this family with regret -- the more I become acquainted with the Dr : & Mrs : W—— -- the better I am pleased with them -- he is a most agreeable companion , & has those winning & unaffected manners -- which recommend & adorn good sense & learning -- while they seem to conceal these excellencies -- in the person I have named good temper seems predominant over every other qualification -- Mrs. W—— has many amiable qualities . & is I dare say a good friend -- as well as an amiable wife & mother . I hear have asked Dr : W to let me see his Ode to fancy with which I am much pleased -- I dare say should think you must have read it in Dodsley 's miscellanies -- it was performed with music the first Evening & I think it a i s a fine Ode -- If I should be able to procure any thing in the literary way for you I shall have pleasure in doing it -- hitherto these subjects have not been talked of -- We saw yesterday some drawings in Crayon of a young Lady who has never been taught , Sr : Joshua Reynolds was struck with them & said that she ought by no means to have a master -- I think she has copied a picture of Guido -- I believe finely , -- & a head of our Saviour -- in which the Expreſsion is very characteristic -- if I may say so -- she is a very pretty woman -- looks sensible & agreeable & is much admired here -- her name is Collins , A Leonidas & Mrs. Glover are both well & unite in Love to you -- I am certain I may say that we should all form a mutual wish -- to have you with us could it poſsibly be accomplished -- Adieu my dear Miranda -- You can never doubt -- nor never need the aſsurance of my Affection -- tell me that you do not Your -- Anna-Maria
