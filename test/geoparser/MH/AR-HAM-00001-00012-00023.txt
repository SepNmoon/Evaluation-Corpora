My Dear Miſs Hamilton I kept your Servant to write a Line that you might know our Situation which you saw so good as to enquire after . Little Augusta s Fever is very much leſsen 'd thō not quite gone , but when one considers how very high it was She is better than one cd . have hoped in the time . Mrs Feilding is pretty well . My Complaint was very plaguing all Yesterday but Dr Turton aſsures me tis in the right way to go off , ( wch . must be attended with Soreneſs beyond what you can imagine ) I have not been able to wear any thing but my loose bed Gown . You can not think how anxious I am to get it into a State that will allow of my appearing at Kew House , but yet am Sensible if I do any thing to inflence it , I shall only make it worse & retard the Cure , & I know the Queen s Goodneſs will consider this . I beg my Duty & best Affections to all the dear Children & remain Ever most faithfully Yrs . C.Finch May 24 th - 1780 Wednesday Morng . I have scrawld sadly but tis my right Arm that you know is so dis a bled .
