Uppm- Decr . 6 th - 1805 My dear Mrs. Dickenson I found your last letter on My return from Newark where I had been three weeks at Mrs. Godfrey 's -- I shou 'd have Staid there much longer but was against my inclination Obliged to return to Upping Ham to Sign Some Deeds relative to the Estate wch . I fancy is by this time paid for & the money placed in the funds -- I can not sufficiently thank you for the trouble you are so kind as to take in offering to find a Situation for us at Northampton -- Till Mr- J 's return from London I can not exactly say what our annual income will be but I think I may venture to say that we can afford to give £50 a year each for board and lodging -- & certainly expect two rooms entirely to our-Selves , I cou 'd wish three but two we can not do without -- I think I shou 'd wish to go in about Feby- & soon after that I hope & trust Mary will join me then , -- I have not been returned from Newark quite a fortnight -- and Since then I have been staying till till this eveg at the Revd . Mr. Jones 's 's at Grantham -- & As I have several other visits to make before I leave this part of the Country I think I can employ my time till feby- perhaps the latter end -- I wish it may be possible to make a bargain with whom we may board with to deduct something whenever we are absent longer than a certain time , as I know I shall be a good deal about with Mrs. Tren in London -- & Mary will I dare say be not leſs frequently from home -- and if the deduction is only sufficient to defray our travelling expences ( tho I shou 'd hope it will be considerably more ) it wou 'd be worth speaking for -- You must know so well the kind of family that wou 'd Suit us that I need not say a word on the Subject -- While I was at Newark I met with great encouragement to Settle there -- wch . I shod- certainly have attempted ( I mean to get a Situation ) had I not been agreably Surprised at My return to Uppm- to find that You remembered Your kind Promise of introducing us to some of Your friends at Northampton -- & also endeavoring to find a Situation for us -- I then gave up all thoughts of Newark -- for As I had a decided preference for Northampton , I shou 'd have fixed at the former place merely from Neceſsity -- As I mean to fill up the remainder of this Sheet of paper to Louisa -- I will Conclude with many thanks Yr- Obliged & affte . Frances Jackson My dear Louisa I have really nothing to say that can at all entertain you but as your favor came at last I can not resist acknoledging it -- I have been so much from home that I have not had an opportunity of copying any patterns for you Yet , but you May depend upon it I will buy some send you a folio Sheet with as many as you can desire You do n't say particularly what you want them for but I will send a variety for a variety of uses -- As I was not quite so much taken with Dr- Ingles as he pretended to be with me you will I hope excuse My sending him any particular kind Meſsage -- and only hope you did not by my absence from Leighton , experience a double portion of his polite attentions -- Pray tell me when you write as I th in k you said he was coming , whether he made any enq uiry after the lady of the order of the Poppy -- or whether was entirely forgotten -- . While I was at Newark I went to one Public aſsembly and one private ball -- at both I met the beautiful but far more apparently far more pleasing Mrs. Campbell -- Mr. Jon Hunter 's Daughter . I mention this because I think yr- Mama knows her -- I think I never Saw a woman more admired than she was -- & I thought her an uncommon pretty dame -- She came with a Mrs. Roger Pocklington -- her husband s Sister -- the private ball was very pleasant , the aſsembly I did not very much like but I think lately I have been in great luck for dancing as I was at an aſsembly here only two evegs- before I went to Newark & I believe we are to have another on friday in honor of the victory -- a victory at wch . I think we shoud rather lament than rejoice -- but I shall probably go if any family is going that I can accompany -- during the t he ime I was at Newark I had another invitation to a ball at Blatherwick hall -- a Mr. O'brien 's -- wch . I of course cou 'd not attend I stopped at Oakham as I came thro ' today to see my little New Cousin George Ashby Barnard -- he is a very fine boy -- Mary Anne is very well and is a very pretty and interesting little I wish you cou 'd see her -- the youngest child , grown plain -- Mr. W is in town -- Mrs. Torkey still here but is likely to go as soon as Mr. W returns , when his agreable Sister for a short time only I am happy to say takes her place -- he intends while she is here to look out for some clergimans widow or well educated woman to Superintend his children and family -- the best plan I think he can pursue as the children are too young to go to School -- Perhaps you can tell me whether there is any good Scool at Northampton as Mr- W seems very anxious if we fix there to place his children when they are old enought there -- believe me dr . Louisa Ys affly F Jackson I was at Newark three or four days with Mr . & Mrs. Kinderley who passed a week at Mr. Godfrey s in their way to London . Mr. K had been confined near three weeks at Wooburn by a dangerous illness in wch . he was attended by Dr. Kerr -- best love to Mr. D . & Mrs. M . My hand is quite cramped with writing so small a hand I hope my Dr- Louisa you will be able to read , it -- Pray let me hear from you soon & let me know what success Mrs. D : has had in her application to Northampton love to the Grants Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Bedfordshire
