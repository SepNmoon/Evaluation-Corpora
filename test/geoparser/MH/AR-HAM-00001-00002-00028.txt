12 August -- 1789 Bath -- I have time only to acknowledge the Receipt of yours of the 5 th - and 7 th - with the gentle jobation I concluded that Mr. D . had wrote to Mr. Cooper to give me credit for what I might draw upon him -- which I could not ascertain till I wound up -- I wrote to Mr. C . on monday for 15£ which is more than I shall want -- but I did not chuse to be short -- & when I think of the money that has been thrown away upon my poor body -- I blush -- Yours of the 9 th - which is just arrived with a Bank Note inclosed for 20£ I like the least of any letter I ever received from you because it is the shortest how happens it I wonder that yr- Letters come so quick -- before this week , they have always been 5 days upon the road which was the reason that I did not write to Mr. D . as I concluded that 12 days at least must elapse before I cd . receive a remittance -- Mr. D—— likes to find fault with me -- I am in too good an humour and too high spirits at the thought of seeing you again soon , to pout or let that or thing else vex me wh . is not a good thing for my stomack -- I will not journalize upon this Scrap -- if I can not write tomorrow -- I will or , like the Scotsman , bring this Letter myself , by way of security -- We have had a very unpleasant report of a discovery of an intended Conspiracy against the Life of our King -- I hope there is no foundation for it whatever -- by a private Letter -- the Swedes have beat the Ruſsians at Sea -- The bells are ringing Colors flying from every Steeple & cannons roaring , -- on Acct . of the Prince s Birthday -- I believe the same will be done in honor of a certain personage with a cloven foot -- -- I am to say ten thousand things the most affce . & the most kind from Mrs. Garrick , of whom I shall write in my journal -- Pray send me a fourfooted Creature i o f some sort to Buxton on Wednesday -- I have taken a place for monday & shall not grumble at any sort of a Conveyance that will carry me to the arms of my dearly beloved Mary Adieu God bleſs you & Your clever J.
