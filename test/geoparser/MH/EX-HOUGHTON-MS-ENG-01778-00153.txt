Cheverel Oct : 18 th - M y dear Friend I began to be afraid You had le ft me off ; and as I wrote to our dear Mrs. Carter the o ther day ; but I comforted myself that you were too busy a nd too happy to find time to write , and therefore tho ' I regretted I did not complain . -- I did not get your le tter till to day the 18 th . You will see the reason by the date of this . I am not at Bristol , but on a visit to our ex cellent friends the Stonhouse 's , to whom I had a most co nvenient opportunity of delivering Your kind Meſsage . I do indeed envy you the situation of which you seem so well to know the value . What can be more delightful in this world , or give one a more lively idea of the p leasures of the next than “ to hear wisdom and goodneſs co ntinually dropping from the lips , and illustrated in t he lives of your noble Hosteſs and her honoured friend ? Pray present my most affectionate respects to dear Mrs. Delany and tell her I will certainly send a Copy of Dean 's Swift 's charming letter as soon as I get to Bristol ; the letter is there , or I wou 'd have obey 'd her commands directly . She does me great honour in asking my opinion of Les Veillées du Chateau . Littl e as that opinion is worth , I am not en etat to give it , for just as I had finished the 1 st . Vol : I was called off to other reading , and have never been able to return to it . I can not therefore speak in detail of a Work I have not read ; so far as I did go I found it unexceptionable as to morals , and interesting to a degree that surprises one , considering that the Narratives and Events are nothing in themselves , but become charming by the Art she has of seizing the affections , and of giving an useful turn to the most unpromising circumstances . -- I beg you will immediately let Stéphanie Félicité comtesse de Genlis have a copy of Le Bas bl eu e. I am so much flattered by her desire to poſseſs it , that if it wou 'd not have been impertinent I wou 'd have enclos 'd it in this Cover . -- I shou 'd have burst with envy at the Account of Your Hampton Party when you tell me that Lady Stormont and Mr. Walpole were of it , if the remembrance that you have lost Sir W. H . did not convert Envy into Pity . I feel for you the greatneſs of this loſs . -- Sr. Wm . and I have been in Treaty for me to return this Month to Sandleford , but we cou 'd not accommodate our time to each other , so we have agreed that my Visit shall be paid to her at Bath to which place she comes with the Primate of Ireland early in next Month ; towards the end of it I shall be thinking of turning my face towards Hampton I spent a night at Bath in my way hither , I divided my Time between Mrs. Montagu and Lady Middleton who are both there , and have promised to give them a day in my way back , which will be about the 25 th . -- Among the many things which I expect You will tell me in your promised letter , the principal one is whether you are to live in Town : this is to me a very interesting piece of intelligence ; I shou 'd be sadly mortified to lose you , but I hope there is no danger . I must not forget to tell You of a Phenomenon I have lately discovered , and which at present much engages my Mind . The excellent Ducheſs and her incomparable friend have found few things more wonderful in all their deep researches into Nature . I have lately made a friendship with a poor Creature , born and bred a Milkwoman whose whole life has been devoted to the lowest offices such as milking Cows , selling the Milk about the Streets , and feeding Hogs to support a miserable existence , and feed Six Small children , and yet who writes most excellent Verses . She has a fine Imagination , stored with abundance of Images , a great variety of Poetical Expreſsion , and an ear so finely tuned , that in five hundred lines , I have not been able to detect an unmusical one . She has very noble sentiments , and what is infinitely better , very good principles . I wou 'd have sent You some Specimens , but unluckily , the good Woman ha d s so interlarded all her Poems with undeserved praises of your unworthy friend , that I must entirely weed it before I can shew them to any body . In her choice of words she is excellent , yet has never seen a Dictionary . In short I do look upon her to be quite a Prodigy . -- Mrs. Ord desire me to say for them every thing that is kind affectionate for them , and the good D r . bids me tell you that he never married but two Couples , but if you will bring The Stonhouses down to Cheverel , he will be delighted to make you the third . They join me in wishing You all the happineſs You desire and deserve . Adieu ! let me find a letter from Yo u on my return to Bristol . Never mind Franks Yours my dear friend most affectionately Mr. D . to have been thrown in My friend s way & what a satisfaction to her benevolent heart to be ye . instrument , for I doubt not but it will in ye . end prove so , of raising a worthy object from distreſs & of transplanting this fair field flower to a richer soil where its beauty will improve by cultivation & it will no longer “ waste its sweetneſs on ye . desert air ” H More , Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard ( fifth edn , 1751 ) , p.8 . !
