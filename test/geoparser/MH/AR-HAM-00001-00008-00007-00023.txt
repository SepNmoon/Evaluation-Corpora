Cloak -- shades the face & the Cloak reaching down to the feet disguises the whole figure -- others wear a long square piece of Black Stuff -- Silk or serge wch . is thrown over ye Head & comes half way down ye . body -- this is still worn in Spain -- & in some parts of Ireland -- for those people I think I 've been told or read came from Spain & are ye only People at this day free of that Country -- no Hats are worn here by ye Women . -- Tuesday ye . 6 th . After Breakfast we saw L'Eglise Collegiate -- richly ornamented wth . Marble and over the great Altar a fine Picture by Van Dycke -- the Subject , the Elevation of the Croſs , -- it is between two Windows and has a bad light -- but in itself it is a Picture without faults -- another Picture by Crayer of the Trinity & The Virgin Mary , -- We then went to the Chanoineſses , -- saw Tuesday 6 th . continued Saw a good Picture of the Nativity by Jourdain s -- The Chanoineſse very polite & shewd us a pretty private Chapel . -- we could not get Horses , & were obliged to stay to dinner -- they told us there was un table D'Hôte -- or publick table that day for travellers -- we agree 'd for the Jokes sake to dine at it -- our Company consisted of two Silent Priests -- a very talking impertinent Dutchman -- a well bred genteel Man who spoke very good French & five or Six strange Ill looking people shabbily Dreſs 'd -- we was glad to l eave our Companions -- wch . we did before they rose from table as our Horses were by that time ready -- to shew how natural it is for every set of peo p le to take advantage when in their power & neglect that rectitude by wch . alone we ought ever to be guided . -- the frenchman told Ld D . he was shamefully imposed upon wth . regard to our Horses -- & that no Person of that Country or those used to travel in that in it ever submitted to these impositions -- the Dinner too wch . we had this day at only 2 Escalins or 14 d English a Head was as good as when we pay bespeak it at 6 Escalins a Head -- I think Clara I see you Smile at my taking notice e of what you may think uninteresting -- the reason of my doing so , is that in case fortune should ever send me or any of my friends to this part of the World where I or they may chance to have the man a gement of the Journey I may not be at a loſs -- indeed if I was to travel to Egypt I should continue to make ye . most minute observations . -- Here we had , a Brick floor in ye . eating Room but no Beds , -- soon after we got into this Town there was a Storm of Thunder & Lightning & heavy Rain -- I never heard any thing more awful than one clap -- & the Servt . told us there was a Ball of fire seen to fall in the Inn Yard -- Courtray is Subject to the House of Austria -- Situated on ye River Lys in ye .

P . & family he was very Ill & not able to leave his Room -- Ldy . C. F . & her governeſs went wth . us to see the Abbey of S t . Piere -- I wish my dear I could transport You thither -- for I fear my description will give Yo . but a poor Idea of what is in itself very great -- The Salle à Manger the finest I ever saw -- the Ceiling painted in a masterly manner by Simon ( a painter now living at Bruſsels ) it is painted upon Linnen -- & they told us it was finish 'd in 47 days -- this expedition is to me very astonishing for the Room in 300 feet long -- the sides of this Room are coverd with beautiful Landscapes painted by Artois a Man now living -- but I could not learn his place of residence -- it was near ye Abbè 's dinner time & their tables were laid ready I believe these good People live in a very different Stile from their Brothers ye . poor Monks -- for a most Savory smell of made dishes & ragoos exhal 'd on all sides -- we were obliged to give place to them & left this room sooner than we wish 'd -- The Abbè de St. Piere is Comte de Flandre , there are only 32 Abbès enjoy this Magnificant residence -- from this Room we went to ye Library wch . in 97 feet Long ye sides of wch . fill 'd wth . Books -- werech . were in ye most regular oder -- there were some partitions wch . had open wire doors lockd up over wch . was wrote Hell or purgatory -- I forget wch . these were fill 'd wth . those Books not proper to be read -- I believed they containd im̄odest , Deistical & controversial Books -- I was not a little surprised to see a large Old Bible wch . from ye largeneſs of the Letter catchd my Eye in paſsing -- we enquird why that Book was plac 'd there , & they told it us it was a bad Edition -- Over ye . Doors in ye . Library were paintings in Clair-obscur wch . had a most astonishing Effect for I till I was told , I actually took them for carved figures -- & after an examination one can hardly be persuaded that ye . figures are not Substantial -- they were painted by one Girard Girard who lives at Antwerp -- The Chapel or Church belonging & wch . forms one part of this Building -- is Elegant & rich to a great degree & is likewise excesively neat -- the High Altar all Solid Silver the Candles sticks of wch . there are a great number above 6 feet high -- ye Lamps & c. of the same metal . --
