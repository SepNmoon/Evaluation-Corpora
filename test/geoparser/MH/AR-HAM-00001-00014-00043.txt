Kew House Tuesday Afternoon Whilest I was wondering that I had not received a Letter from you by the Post as I know that you never promise without a full intent of performing , your welcome Epistle my dear Friend was brought to me , believe me it gave me most sincere pleasure , it would have been more compleat , if you had mentioned your own Health , & whether you had any intention of Dipping , pray remember in your next to be sincere as to that Article , it is the only one in which I shall ever doubt your Sincerity , “ mais sur ce Sujet je suis un peu infidelle ” . The description of your paſsing your Time appears very comfortable & I sincerly rejoice in it , & I wish I could make you a Visit , believe me our Life here is not to be envied , last Week we went three Times to the Queens House , the Time we spend there might be agreable , but it is quite the reverse & I return back to this Dungeon worn & heated to Death , & wishing what I never did before in my Life for the hour of going to Bed , we have endeavoured to vary our Evenings as much as poſsible , Miſs G . has been with us once , but when Mrs Fielding is here it is cruel to take her from him , Mr Fielding has likewise been here , & we have alternately drank Tea in my Room , Yesterday Evg , at eight o'Clock Mrs Hotham came to see the Princeſs 's , the Elder Princes brought him , we received him in the Gallery ( I had her Majesty s Commands about it ) the three little Princes came likewise , he staid about half an hour during which time the Elder Princes a l'ordinaire made the little ones as noisy as poſsible they then conducted him back to their own House where I believe he staid till near ten o'Clock , & we took our Work & Book , & glad I am that Ceremony is over , he was very lively & civil & I agree perfectly with you as to the good Effects of the Reconciliation , the Duke of Cumberland has not been at the Drawing Room it is said on account of his Health -- I see no Prospect of their Majesties return , I have order to carry the Princeſs 's to morrow to be at the Queens House by ½ pt nine . I have not my dear forgot your kind request , & will send it you this Week , I hoped to have done so before this time , & it has not been my Fault that I have not Publick News the Papers I daresay inform you , & as to Private except our dull Routines I know of more . the D of Gloucester s Speech is universally aproved of , & I believe likewise that it is much suspected that the Americans have been at the bottom of the Riot , I hope soon the truth of it will be known & punished . I am happy to hear The King behaves so well , God grant it may continue , for her own sake as well as yours , she is capable of it if she chooses , but it is a tender Subject , & what I am so much dispirited about by my own fatal experience , that I endeavour to think as little about it as poſsible , I beg you will give my Affte Duty & thanks to Pſs Elizt for her Letter , which I have not time to do to day , there was no Secret in it I aſsure you . I beg my love to dear H R H who I shall write to on Thursday , I inclose a Letter from Ly C.Charlotte to her , & another to you , P. Royal sends her love , I delivered all your kiſses , & have many Loves in return .
