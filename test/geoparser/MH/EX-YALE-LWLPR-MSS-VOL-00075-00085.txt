I return you a thousand thanks , Dear Madam , for the favour of your kind and comfortable Letter . I know not how sufficiently to thank my dear Mrs Delany , nor to admire her generous attention to the feelings of her friends , at a time when one could only expect her to be engroſs 'd by her own . she does me but Justice in believing that I most truly Sympathised in her affliction , and was very apprehensive for her health . I had written to Mrs. Sandford , for I thought a Letter addrest to herself would be only troublesome and afflicting at present . the day before I received yours I had great comfort from Mrs. Boscawen who told me how admirably our excellent friend preserv 'd her sweet and patient resignation . I know the greatneſs of her mind and the strength of her principles . but still I fear for her Mortal frame . a selfish fear ! of what perhaps constitutes her greatest consolation . It is a great satisfaction to me to hear that you are in Town who must be so great a support to her . I much fear Mrs. Sandford is not able to attend her as I am sure she wishes to do , and I would gladly have come to Town to have tried to supply her place if I could have flatter 'd myself it would have been acceptable , and if more precious Comforters were not at hand . I thought you had gone out of Town immediately upon your Marriage , or I should have offer 'd you my Sincere congratulations . alas that I must now add condolence to them ! your loſs is indeed a general Concern -- but heavy indeed must it be to those who enjoy 'd so high a place as you did in the friendship of the excellent Dſs of Portland ! -- how unspeakably great to her first Friend ! May God Almighty support and comfort her ! -- I am glad to hear that Mr. Dewes is coming to her . where does she mean to spend the remainder of the Summer ? I am much obliged to you and to Mr. Dickenson for the honor you did me in calling at my Lodgings , and shall be always happy to cultivate your acquaintance and kindneſs . I beg my best Compliments and Congratulations to Mr. Dickenson . Be so good to expreſs for me the most affectionate wishes my heart is capable of to my dear good Mrs. Delany with the truest Gratitude for her kind remembrance of me . Mr . & Mrs. Burrowses and Mr Smith & famy all desire to offer their kindest Condolence and are most truly touch 'd and interested for her . Mrs. Amy Burrows was withheld , as I was , from writing to Mrs. Delany by the feat of disturbing and troubling her , but her tender heart , which has suffer 'd like deprivations , feels sincerely for her 's . I am Dear Madam with repeated th your very much obliged and obedient Servant Hester Chapone July 24 th . 1785 I beg my thanks and good wishes to poor dear Mrs. Vesey ( the late accounts I have heard of Mr V . 's will fill me with indignation and Concern , and disappointed me the more as I had heard a very different account . ) Mrs Dickenson 2 Clarges Street Piccadilly London
