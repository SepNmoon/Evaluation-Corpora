Dear Sir , I received a letter yesterday from Mr. Robt . Greville at Ld . Stormont 's at little grove , enclosing one from Col. Newton of the 10 th . Dragoons now at Leicester notifying the vacancy of a Cornetcy , which by General Pitt 's desire is offerd to my Son , and I am in consequence directed to lodge in the hands of Meſs rs . Cox & Greenwood Agents to the Regt . the Sum of £1,102 , 10 . The limited price by the King 's Regulation . The Recommendation can not be sent in to the Secretary at War for his Majesty 's approbation till the Money is actually deposited ; but Mr. Greenwood has been so good as to aſsure me that he will give me notice when will be the latest day that the payment can with propriety be deferr 'd . Since I receiv 'd the favor of your last with the Deed -- , I have receiv 'd notice from Mr. Balfour that he expects to receive the Thousand Pounds on the 11 th . of November next , Martinmas Day , one of the Terms in in Scotland for lending money , as it can not be got in the middle of a Quarter . You will perceive Dr . Sir that this money wou 'd come too late to answer my present purpose , & that if I mean to come off with credit , there shou 'd be no delay in my lodging the money ; I will therefore with the utmost gratitude accept your very obliging offer ; and will do every thing most scrupulously for your security as well as for the punctual repayment of the money at the time you will prescribe . Shou 'd it happen to occur to you that it might be eligible for you to lend a Thousand Pounds upon the Security of the Heretable Bond with a Collateral Bond on the Security of my Personal Property , obliging myself & Heirs to repay the money at six months notice , the busineſs cou 'd be easily settled ; but I beg you will be aſsured that by this offer I mean your own accommodation solely . My Son is not yet informed of the vacancy , nor of your generous offer in his behalf ; these you may be aſsured will be subjects of the utmost satisfaction to him . I shall be happy to hear of your having received benefit from sea bathing , I fear you wou 'd be soon weary of that detestable place Park Gate . Mrs. Hamilton my Daughter & Robt . desire to offer their affectionate Compts . with mine to you & Mrs. Dickenson . I rejoice with you in the satisfaction you receive from your little Girl & remain My Dear Sir , Your faithful Humble Servt Frederick Hamilton Oxford St . 249 September 25 th . 1789 .
