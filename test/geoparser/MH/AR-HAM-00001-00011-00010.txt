Chelsea 13 th . Septr . Thursday night My drst : Miſs Hamilton It is very late , & I have so bad a head Ach ( by having looked my Eyes out at the delightful Contents of the Museum , this Morng : ) that I can only write you a Line instead of a Letter -- I recd : late this Evening the Queen 's most gracious Present , & as I am not certain whether I ought to send a Letter to her Majesty but through the hands of some of her Servants . I send you the inclosed -- if it is most proper -- you will present it -- but as her Majesty did not ( as with the former Books ) send them through you , & you think therefore I should send the Letter directly to her Majesty you will be so good to give it to The Page , to give it in the manner ; it ought to be presented . I never can say what I feel for the Queen 's goodneſs , I only wish there was a peculiar Language to be used only for the sincere , & then I should write with more comfort & confidence . only think how provoking , that the Book is not yet done which I was to present to the Queen -- but I am delighted to think Mr : Davies has found his Table of Cebes , & has goodnaturedly insisted upon my having it ; so it is gone to be bound -- I shall send up to London early in hopes of being able to get it & send with my Letter . Adieu my head is so aching I can scarcely see what I write , so I must go to sleep to be able to write better tomorrow Yrs : very Affly : PDartrey Friday ½ past 4 o'Clock I wish ed I dared tell the Queen how much we long to See her Majesty at our little Cottage -- I never should have presumed to have thought of her honouring our Humble Dwelling ; if She had not given me such encouragement by her gracious goodneſs to me . my head ach is gone ( I thank God ) . as to the Gown Lord D—— knows nothing of the account , & he begs me to say , your liking it , is the payment he prefers to any other ; so you must never think anything more about it . you do him honor by wearing his Country 's Manufacture adieu -- send me one Line if you can in ansr : & tell me how you do ; my duty to the Princeſses
