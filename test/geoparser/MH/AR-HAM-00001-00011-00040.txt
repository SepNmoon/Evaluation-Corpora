Kedleston Monday Sept : 8 th : 1788 My Dear Mrs : D : Altho ' you desired N. Palfrey might write to give you an Acct : how we got here & c. I can not allow her to do so , when I have the comfort of being enabled to tell you , that my Dear Husband , likes this Place very much , thinks the Waters agree & seems really better , since we have been here in Spirits , than I could have allowed myself to hope -- this you know , is such a Cordial Draught as must do me eſsential good ; & the tranquility of The Scene around me , the pleasant Walks & fine Air ( for I never breathed any more delightful ) will I humbly trust strengthen my poor shattered Frame , to go thro ' a London Winter -- which hurry I do not allow myself to think of , as it wd : destroy the good which the present qeuit Life I lead here wd . do me . The Weather has been remarkably fine , & the Soil is so dry , I that after one Day 's Rain , wh : we had , ( it was last Sunday sennight . ) it was so dry on Monday Morng : that I was able to walk out ; Ld : Scarsdale is so good as to give us leave to drive & walk about his Park , which is a fine One -- & he has a most magnificent Collection of Pictures , wh : are a great amusement to my Dr : Husband -- We have seen the China Manufactory , & are going to see the fine Raphael at Okeover as soon as Adl : Edwards one of our Party is quite well , at present he has a little sore throat . As to myself , I confeſs walking out quietly , & thinking of my Angels , is my greatest Indulgence , when I am not with my Husband but I bleſs God I can join the Party , without being , I hope , a troublesome intruder by my Sadneſs , tho ' I can not expect to add to their Livelineſs -- indeed as I think Exertion has sometimes hurt me , I keep now as quiet as I can , & I make Nanny read to me a great deal ; wh : tranquillizes me more than any thing & does her good , poor Soul ! at the same time . She reads to me in a covered Seat , in the Garden , or in a neighbouring Field , wh : commands a Charming View ) & where I breath the sweet Air at the same time . Wedy : Since I wrote this , I awkwardly strained my Knee wh : I have done twice since I had the Rheumatic attack at Chelsea , but as Mrs : Curzon an Old Aquaintance of mine was so good as to take me out airing , I have not miſsed enjoying this fine weather -- this Morng : I have been walking , & thank God am not fatigued by it -- I feel stronger than when I came -- now I have been talking so much about myself wh : I should be ashamed of doing , if you were not so kindly interested about me -- let me ask how you , Mr : D . & your dear little Louisa do , I hope perfectly well & happily enjoying her daily improvements . I have heard lately from Ly : W . & I fear She & Marianne were going to have the Influenza , & She is unhappy about Sir Wm : who is far from well by her account ; -- that is , he is out of spirits , & very nervous , wh : is a sad Complaint for so young a Man . If you see poor Dr : Mrs : Vesey & Mſs : H . give my kind Love -- I often think of them Poor Souls ; I fear They have no Lady now to call upon Them -- Lord C . sends you his best wishes & Joins me in the same to Mr : D . Kiſs yr . dr : little Child & believe me very Affly : yours PCremorne I beg my best Comps . to Miss Clarks . I hope you have good accounts from Taxal . -- I have quite forgot to ask you whether you ever recd : a Letter from Mrs : Earle , left at Mrs : Vesey s for you by her Son . -- To Ly Cremorne N o : 27 .
