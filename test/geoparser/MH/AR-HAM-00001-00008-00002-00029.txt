Audley End Febry 9 th - My dearest I received yr letter this morning -- & can not Suffer a Post to go out without Thanking you for it -- most heartily do I Pray to almighty God for ye restoration of yr Comfort , & as I bleſs God that you have acted so wisely -- I hope that the dear Child of yr Hear ts will soon be in a Convalescent stile . I have the highest opinion of Dr. Kerr of Northampton his reputation is unimpeach 'd & he is very right to have his Patient immediately under his Eye . you have taken this in Time -- & the change of Air & Scene will do you all good -- besides a Sound Constitution free from all fr s -- a well form 'd figure -- she is bleſs 'd with such a disposition . that you have no difficulty 's to Struggle with but this t y Cold , which has taken too fast a hold -- she has been all her life time so uncommonly well brought up as to hours -- Eating , & c ( for th ' o indulg 'd she was never a Spoyl 'd Child ) that you will find the Greatest advantages both to yr selves , & to her , for these forbearances , which cd t other Children , are not more thought of by her -- all I can add , is this -- which comes from the bottom of my Heart -- that if there is any aſsistance I can give -- you may command me & depend upon me -- if my going to Northampton could ease yr attentions , I will do so I will take a lodging -- in short any thing -- & every thing will I do most willingly to be of comfort or Service -- I will now tell you all the News I hear -- imprimis -- the Duke of Roxburgh call 'd at the door of a friend of Lord B—— s . to say that there is a report that the definitive Treaty is arrived -- this will be a great Consolation to the largest part of the World . only those who have lost their Places will Sulk -- a report also of instability -- Pitt has been at Wickham with Lord Carrington -- Lord Carrington is gone with him to Walmer -- if he des ts after behaving so well -- we can only repeat , ( what I am sorry to add we have often experienc 'd ) Oh how faillible is human Nature -- & how uncertain , are human resolutions -- Pitt s Character was never Aimiable til he supported Government , when he had left the -- I shall make you angry about yr dear Miſs Moore -- you must not repeat this -- but I will tell you a very horrid Story -- when first she took upon her self to interfere with this Clergyman . She wrote to Windham , informing him that this Curate had neglected his duty -- & that he was a very bad Man -- Windham writes to his Nephew the Dean of Wells -- who supposing his Uncle would not have taken up a fact matter of this sort , without some Enquiry -- goes to the doting Bishop of Bath & Wells . besides which she got a letter to this Effect from the Bishop of London -- accordingly this man was dismiſs 'd with Contumely -- but however , Windham thought he had been implicated hastily in this busineſs he therefore went first to the revisions -- & discover 'd that a large sum of Money had been given to them for telling this Story in their -- way -- he then sent to the Conductors of the Anti Jacobin -- on whom he could depend . They told him they had been offer 'd large sums from Wilberforce , I am not sure -- but I think from the Bp of L——n also , to invent their Story -- but this they positively refus 'd . & insisted on having the correspondence -- & insisting the truth -- he has investigated the whole affair . & declares -- that it is the deepest conspiracy amongst them all to propegate Methodism that ever was heard of -- now th ' o I do not admire this Gentleman -- I can not believe he cd tell a falsehood , & as he was never partial to Hannah More , because she went in favour of Government ( whilst he was in office ) he must be thoroughly Convinc 'd , before he cd be such a Ca t , we have had a very agreeable visitor for 2 Nights lord Essex . he is very Gentlemanly & pleasant , I have had a letter from Mrs Carter , this morning who has been Severely ill & had medical advice she is well enough to Walk out a little way -- she writes that Lord Mendip has given most unequivocal Proofs of his regard to his Widow by leaving her every thing for too her Life -- he was so croſs to her letting -- that the World had made a most Unjust Will for him -- I am glad she has outlived him -- Mrs Carter sees very little of Mrs Digby at present as she is constantly with Ly Mendip -- tell my dear Louisa -- with my kind love -- that I have danc 'd a Cottillion with the Miſs Nevilles -- that to be sure my breath was a little shorter than my partners , but that I did beyond any expectations -- that I beg she will make haste & get quite well . that at our return to Beds : she may know the Advantage of dancing with me -- Mr ly is here at present & on Thursday were Mr & Mrs Peachy -- pray write to me as soon as you can -- & accept Mrs Jalabert s kindest Compts . & good wishes -- my love to Mr D : & dear Lou -- Concludes me most Sincely & Affecly yrs DBlosset if Milk agrees , ask Dr. Kerr if Lou may not take to bad Milk -- Skim it well -- Put it with an after the Bread is taken out Soke it . when the S rises like a Custard take it off -- put it with the again & bake it -- & take of the Scum Til after baking the Scum ceases -- then it is fit to be given two or three tea Cups in the Course of the day luke warm -- with a little brown Sugar Candy -- it is Nourishing -- & Cooling -- show this to Dr Kerr , I have given this recipe to a Physician & to a Great Man at Reading -- they have adopted it & thank 'd me for it -- Mrs Carter writes that poor Mrs Chapone s death was a great reverse -- she was debilitated in Mind & Body -- she died at her own home at Hadleigh & had every comfort the B s 's could give her -- I do not think Mrs C : Valued Mrs Chapone as she ought since Mrs Douglas 's Marriage -- I am happy to find Miſs Dickenson was better for Dr Kerrs Medicines -- tell her to get well immediately -- to be ready for our dance -- When she gets Stout . she will go & see her Grand -- Native Air -- has it Advantages -- th ' o it may be too Cold at present .
