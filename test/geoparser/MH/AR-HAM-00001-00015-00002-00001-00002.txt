As to what you say respecting Osyiris or rather what you hear said -- it is in my opinion wrong to detiremine -- for I should imagine ye . amusement he takes is absolutely neceſsary -- his mind wld . otherwise be oppreſs 'd , & After all perhaps tis for the sake of his Children that he promotes & enters into it . I hear nothing of Public affairs but what you write to me for I do not read the papers , & this is not a place to get intelligence . Adieu Honble . Miſs Gunning Melsom Street Bath
