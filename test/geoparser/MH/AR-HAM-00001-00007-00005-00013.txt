Dear Madam I am very anxious to know how Miſs Hamilton does after the Shock that I 'm afraid the news of Mrs. Thursby 's Death must have given her & take the liberty to trouble you with all our Enquiries after her as I think a note might only distreſs her if her Spirits are agitated -- I have so bad a Cold at present that I fear it will be hardly poſsible for me to call on her as I hoped to have done either today or Monday but we all long to know how She is & I hope you will excuse my detaining you so long & am D . Madm . Yr . sincere & faithful Hble Sert . S. Feilding Saturday Morning
