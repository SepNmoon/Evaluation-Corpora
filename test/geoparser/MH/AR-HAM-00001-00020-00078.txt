Edinr . 6 th . April 1783 . My Dear Sister , Be so good as to present the inclosed to Miſs Clarke . Will you never leave off drawing me into Correspondencies ? Remember Mr. Farhill . Since my arrival here I have done nothing but Feast . The affectionate reception I meet with from my Friends here amply makes up for the cold insipidity of my London Relations . Talk not to me of English politeneſs , which consists of a stiff Curtsey or bow and an invitation to a Route . Compare this with a clean Hearth , a good Fire , a good Dinner & a hearty welcome . Blush for your English Breeding , & allow that we excel John Bull in real hospitality . Neither are our Miſses more forward than Yours ( recollect your conversation with me ) . To be sure they neither Paint , nor drive the expreſsion of their feelings from their countenance . If they esteem You they are not ashamed to acknowledge it -- Now Madam , I have seen Miſs L . . Have been displeased & determined never to make a second offer to Her . When She did not accept of me , secresy was required from me . I kep't it inviolably . She or her friends ( proud of the proposal ) have told it to my Relations . Gueſs my surprise when within twenty four Hours of my arrival , it was mentioned to me by four different People . Some approving & vice versa . I have visited her twice & am much taken notice of by her Relations , have handed her out of the Playhouse & to her Chair at a Private Ball & can be as indifferent as the D. of Atholl . Yesterday I dined & supped with her at her Aunt s . Her father was present . My spirits happened to be afloat & I flirted openly with another Lady . Is not this admirable . No accounts yet of my Watch . Your advice was good , but had been put in Execution before I received it . The Evening I was robbed I wrote to the Man who made it , directing him to acquaint Fielding s Men & to offer a reward , but I have not the most distant idea of recovering it . Your conjecture about my Nerves was ill founded . The Gentleman I was to have wrote to is expected in England with the first fleet from Canada . Had You been present at my Adventure , an unconcerned Spectator it would have amused You ; when we meet , You shall have a full account of it . The conversation lasted full ten Minutes . Mrs. Hunter begs her best Compts- to You . At present her Breadth considerably exceeds her Length . Next Month she intends to make me an Uncle & from the good Health She is in , we have the most flattering hopes of her being more fortunate than she was last time . Adieu . Write to me soon & long . Beleive me never more sincere than when I add Your Affect : Brother and Friend N——
