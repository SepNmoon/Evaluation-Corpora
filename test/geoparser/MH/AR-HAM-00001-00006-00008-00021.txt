The Inclosed Lines muſt plead my Excuse for not waiting on Miſs Hamilton tomorrow Evening . Underſtanding his Disgrace is no ſecret in he thought he could not do better than join in the Laugh againſt himself . -- He can do no more , 'till he receives Letters from Town , that will ſhew he had no Intention to abſcond from his Creditors , & that it was by their own advice & concurrence he left London . -- Mrs H I am happy I can give you ſome good News along with the bad ; for I believe you to be my friend s , & you can feel in either . -- Peruſe the Inclosed from Amſterdam & return it me to morrow morning . -- It is ſome conſolation to think that thoſe who know me moſt beſt , as Companions , are more my frie nds than my own Relations . Indeed they know no m little of me , than that I have ſpent a great deal of money ; and with them , the want of Œconomy comprehends every ſin . -- For Miſs Hamilton
