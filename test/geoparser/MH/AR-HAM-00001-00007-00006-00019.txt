My dear Madam I do not deserve the goodneſs you have shewn me in suffering your obliging Letter to have remained so long unanswered . Mrs. F . & myself are both infinitely obliged to you for your kind Congratulations : Mrs. F . is very anxious to be known to you , & is as happy as the rest of your friends , in the prospect of seeing you in London in the Spring . We shall be there in the Spring for a short time . I have no house in Town , that being beyond the reach of my Finances at present . The Circumstances of my connexion with Mrs. F . are somewhat singular . She is the only Child of a man of large fortune , & beloved by him in a great degree : He gave his consent to our Marriage , but he settled his estate upon his daughter , but has given us little or nothing at present , or ever , I beleive , will give ; so much stronger is his Love for his Guineas then his daughter : But this is entre nous . My little woman however , who is all Goodneſs , does every thing in her power to make me amends for the strange r behaviour of her Father . Your very worthy friend Mrs. Delaney left Windsor a few days ago : She honoured us with a visit the day before she went to Town : She charged me to tell you that she loved you as much as ever , but that she was no longer able to write herself or to indite to them Letters to her friends . She has great comfort in her young Companion Miſs Port who is grown a very fine Girl . Miſs Burney often enquires for you : She begins to find herself very much at her ease , notwithstanding she is upon very distant terms with poor Madam S . whose constant state of Ill health can not but sower her temper : the good old Lady has however a good heart ; she was pleased with your recollection of her . Matters go on in a certain house pretty much as usual : The Sons , let Papa do all he can , will be young men : The second is , I am sorry to say it , quite drawn into the Vortex of Pleasure , & follows hard the steps of his older Brother : The third is in a bad state of health : the fourth is now travelling about , & is at present at Geneva . Your friend Mr. Preston the Bishop of Ferns was to have been brought upon the English Bench , but some disagreement between the Minister here , & the Minister in Ireland , has put a stop to the exchange for the present . We have sustained a heavy loſs in our Church by the death of our worthy Dean , but the King has appointed a Succesſor with whom we are all highly pleased Dr. Douglaſs . We are to be very gay here about the middle of August : We are certainly to have an Installation . Three Rooms are already fitted up in the Castle in a style truly Royal , -- & great alterations are making in S t . Georges Chapel , the expence of which will amount to 7,000 £ o . as Mr. Dickinson is a Lover of the Arts he must not fail to see this place , & the great works going on : I hope I need not say how happy I shall be to be his Cicerone : It will give equal pleasure to Mrs. F to attend upon Mrs. D . if she can pr ev ail upon herself to give one look more upon old Windsors Towers . I am somewhat anxious about the fate of this Letter , as I recollect very imperfectly the direction you gave me : If the little Louisa engages all your attention , Mr. D . perha ps will ha ve the go odneſs to favour me with a few Lines , so on after he receives this . Give my best Compts : to him , & Beleive me Dear madam your most faithful humble Servt- J Fisher Windsor Jan : 28 . 1788 Mrs. Dickenson at Taxal near Chapel la frith Derbyshire Revd Mr. Fisher Janry 28- 1788
