We walked this Morg from ½ pt 9 till near two o ' Clock , & my poor Feet burn & smart to such a degree this Evg , that I could allmost say , “ such are the Joys of our dancing days & c & c ” Reference not yet identified . The line is also quoted in John Britton 's The Pleasures of Human Life ( 1807 ) . . I hope my Dear to find you in tolerable Spirits & that the inward Satisfaction that the having so thoroughly & so piously performed your Duty may inable you to go through this trying Season , with as little misery as poſsible , I know what it is , therefore can still more strongly feel for you -- God Bleſs you Affly Yr MC Goldsworthy my Love to Chi Chi & Mou Mou --
