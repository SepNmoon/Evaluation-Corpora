35 Aldgate High St : London . Jan : 29 th : 1807 . Many thanks , my dearest Cousin , for your immediate and affectionate reply to my sad communication . What you and Mr : D . so kindly urge , is most natural , and , with the generality of parents , would be subject to no risque . But , I grieve to say , the feelings of the one in question , are at present , very peculiar . I received a letter from him , by the same post with yours , this morning , expreſsive of unchanged affection towards me , but peremptorily declining a meeting , unleſs I declared my conviction of the justice of all his opinions ( you understand me ) . No one , my dearest Cousin , can judge so well as yourself , of the impoſsibility of that . Even were I impreſsed with the most unequivocal belief of it , such a declaration must give eternal offence to him with whom my life is to be spent ; for , if two persons are diametrically opposite in their ideas , it is scarcely neceſsary to say , that nothing but silence can fail to offend one of them . I am really almost distracted , with accumulated afflictions . My complaint ( that you kindly and anxiously enquire after ) is extreme depreſsion and weakneſs , brought on by agitation of mind . The storm broke out , you may remember , immediately after I had had a miscarriage ; which is , in itself , a great streſs upon the constitution and nerves . There is no pregnancy in the case , now , thank Heaven . As you are entitled to all my confidence , my dearest Cousin , I will mention , that my F . has explained in this last letter , his intentions towards me -- which are , 100£ . per annum , being the interest of 2000£. , during his life , and , at his death ( which God avert as long as poſsible ! ) the 2000£ principal , to be paid off his estates . I told you that my H . had has remaining of mine , 1900£ . -- to him , my F . says , he leaves it to make up the remainder of the 6000£ . I was promised at my marriage should be left me in future ; with the interest of it , in present . -- It is all the consolation my situation will admit of , to receive the kindneſs of real friends ; therefore , if not too troublesome , let me hear from you again as soon as poſsible . I could not , at any rate , go to Bath , for two or three days , because my mourning is making up . In the state of affairs I have described , I do n't see the poſsibility , unleſs my finances were such as to enable me to go , to a Lodging , by which means I should not obtrude myself as an inmate , and could take my departure at a moment 's warning , if I found myself unwelcome . I am not ashamed to confeſs to you , that this would be inconvenient to me . I need not tell you that the disposition of my F . is very determined , which encreases the danger of giving offence by acting in opposition to his wishes . -- I do not know the addreſs of my Cousin , Mrs : Orr -- I only know that her residence is somewhere near Worcester -- at least , was , the last time I saw her , which was at Cheltenham . -- Mrs : Mann requests me to present her best thanks for your obliging wishes to her ; and to say , that her ideas would perfectly coincide with yours and Mr : D . 's , but for the unfortunate peculiarity of the circumstances . -- She is not related to the family of her name , at Leighton Buzzard . I feel the highest obligation for the concern you & Mr : D . take about me . My sincere love attends you both , and my Cousin , Louisa . Many thanks for your attention to my tranquillity , in transcribing your own letter . Nothing could be safer or kinder to your U . than it was . -- My S . ister ( whom I have not yet seen , but announced myself to , by letter , on the sad news ) tells me that she has offered to go to B . but does not expect the offer to be accepted . God bleſs you , my dear Cousin , and kind friend . leaves London Monday-Thursday & Saturday at 9 oClock in the morng & sets out from the Cross Keys -- S t .
