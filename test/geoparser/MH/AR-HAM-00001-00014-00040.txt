I am very happy to hear my Dear that Dr Turton really finds you better , & exceedingly so that your pains have erased , I do not wonder you was alarmed at the thoughts of a Sore Throat . I beg you will not think of coming here till you are quite quite well , you must be certain I am sorry for the reason that prevents yr coming , but shall never feel the doing any thing that can relieve you , if you will follow my Motherly Advice it is not to think of coming Thursday I forbid you . Dr little Prſs Mary has been very happy , & was she with me would send her Love , I will deliver yours to every body I am in great haste as I have left the Princeſs 's with Denoyer but I am my Dr most Afy Yr MCG Miſs Hamilton St James 's
