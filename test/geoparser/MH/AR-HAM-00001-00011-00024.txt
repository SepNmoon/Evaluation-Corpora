Tunbridge Wells Friday Augst : 20 th I was unwilling to write to you my Dr : Miſs Hamilton , 'till I could give you some Account of Ld : Mansfield -- I beg you to tell Ly- Stormont , that He this Morning did us the Honor of breakfasting here , with us & that he was so lively & agreable , I could not think him ever an Invalid -- Every body here says He has found great Benefit by the Waters , & Air of this Place -- Lord D meets him every Day upon the Pantiles , & I aſsure you , the hopes of meeting him carried me down the day before Yesterday , & I waited 2 hours , -- in vain -- it was a bad day , & he did not come down -- I aſsure you few People , wd : tempt me to spend so long a time , on so disagreable a Walk -- for I believe in Europe there is not so dirty or tiresome a One -- He looks very well , & is in much better Spirits than I expected . I beg you to aſsure Dr : Mrs : Delany & Mrs : Boscawen that I should feel happy in having it in my power to shew any Civility to Miſs Sayse , but I never go to the Rooms , Publick Breakfasts , or any of those Things , wh : a young Lady would very naturally feel a Civility & Attention . Julia at present prefers walking on the Common , & skipping over Heath like a Lambkin , & I am foolish enough to prefer walking , & indeed talking with her , to walking the Pantiles of or going to the the heated Rooms -- If Miſs Sayse will condescend to drink Tea with such a stupid Old Mother -- I shall be vastly happy to see her . I have made an acquaintance ( rather an Intimacy ) with Mr : Sheridan the Father , & I am in some hopes he will teach me to read without Joking , he is to have a Reading next wedy : & he has invited me , & my Family . I beg you will tell Lord Stormont , I heard he did me the Honor of calling , & I was very sorry , I was not at home Lord Dartrey waited on him the next Day ( I beg you to tell him also ) but he was gone to Town . I hope Lady Stormont & her Little One are going on well . Adieu here are more than six Lines , & I think it wd : be very generous in you to send me six pages in return , Yrs : sincerely PD Sat Morng 8 ' o'Clock I hope you have had good Accounts from Mr : Dickenson pray let me know I am just going to see Ly : J. Penn at the Vine -- 13 miles off -- I inclose you a Letter from Ly : C. Finch , & Miſs Cowley Ld : D returns his best thanks to you & Sr : Wm Hamilton about the Calabrese & the Drawing -- I have nothing to trouble him with but to take care of you & Mr : D—— -- when you go to Naples -- N.B .
