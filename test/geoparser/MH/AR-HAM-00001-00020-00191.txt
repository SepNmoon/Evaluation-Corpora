Brough , 25 th . Janry- 1805 My Dear Sister , I am detained here till a Road is cut through the Snow on Stanmore , which is at present impaſsable . Whether I shall get off tomorrow or not , I can not gueſs , but , as I only arrived here last Night , I am not so unfortunate as some of those , I found here , who have been kept since Tuesday & Wednesday . The Mail is obliged to be forwarded on Horseback & will , I Hope , carry away this Letter . I am to be at Stapleford Hall , on my way to London , & proposed calling on A. Cathcart , & at Leighton House . I now despair of being able to execute this plan & to be in Town on Thursday . If , however , you are at home , ( for I have seen a Mrs- Dickenson figuring away at the Birthday ) write to me , Post Office , Newport Pagnel , & I will try what I can to see You , if only for a Minute . Give my Love & best wishes to Mr. Dickenson , Louisa , & c. & c. & c . Ever Your Affecte- Brother & sincere friend Napier Brough , Twenty Fifth Janry- 1805 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
