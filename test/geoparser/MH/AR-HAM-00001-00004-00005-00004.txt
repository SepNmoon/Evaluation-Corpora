I have been such a Vagabond of late My Dear Miſs Hamilton that it has been impoſsible for me to perform my promise of writing to you -- we arrived here only the day before Yesterday after having made the tour of North & South Holland in the most agreable way in the World -- I am delighted with the mode of traveling in Tracscutes , & find it so adapted to my natural indolence as well as my constitution that I wish I could get to Naples by the same conveyance -- you know how much I dreaded the tour of Holland , & contrary to my exp e ctation it has been a most pleasant one -- the Country tho ' flat , is beautifull , & there is a look of Cleanlineſs , & plenty that which is very agreable -- as to North Holland it is so totally different from any thing one has seen elsewhire , that I would give a good deal to be able to convey to you an idea of what I have seen there -- the first place we went to , in the North was a place call 'd Bruck , it resembles the Chinese Villages you see upon Screens -- the outsides of the houses are painted carved & partly gilt , all look as fresh as if done Yesterday , & the mixture of colours are not tawdry , but elegant , to each house there is a little garden with a kind of Chinese paling , these gardens are full of Parterres of flowers mix 'd wth . shells of different colours , to each house also there are two doors , one ( which they call the Porte fatal ) is never open 'd but upon a Marriage or Funeral , when they put a step to it ( as it is a little raised above the ground ) & it is thrown open , these houses are built round Squares of Water , & along Canals , with little light bridges thrown over every hunded Yards , the whole is intermix 'd with tall trees which add to the beauty of the prospect . These people are so very neat & formal that they wash their Paths wch . are done with brick & sprinkle the sand in patterns , if you go of a Saturday ( wch . is their washing day ) they will not admit you into their houses , & the King of Pruſsia who forced his way into one of these houses some Years ago , was surprised at being taken up in the Arms of a great Dutch maid who set him down at the outside the door that He might not spoil the room she had just wash 'd -- as to their dreſs I can not give you an idea of it without inclosing a swatch of it by way of description , & then you may make it out in a better manner with your Crayons -- I must not not talk to you any more of Holland , it is un Champ si vaste that would require volumes -- we stay 'd two days at Antwerp & were delighted with Reubens Pictures , I had no idea what a master he was before I saw these , & particularly wch . they call the Chapeau de Paille -- ( wch by the by is not so but a Spanish hat ) it represents a n beautifull girl about Seventeen with her Arms croſs 'd & is much beyond any painting I ever saw -- As to Spa My Dr Miſs Hamilton I wish to grow partial to it , but hitherto I hate it monstrously -- it is noisy , diſsipated , Nonsensical & very full of very bad company -- tho there are some exceptions as par example , My Dear little Mrs Graham who looks as beautifull as an Angel & her husband & a few more good people I could name -- both Ly Spencer & I are sick , she with an indigestion , & I with a violent cold wch is a reall distreſs as I have so little a time to drink the waters & can not begin till I get rid of it -- in order to which I must now go to bed & therefore bid you a good night -- let me hear from you as you promised -- My love Sr Wm s love attends Mrs Hamilton & I am ever Yr .
