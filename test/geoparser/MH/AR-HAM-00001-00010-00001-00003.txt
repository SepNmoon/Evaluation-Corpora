Jany . 23 d . 1780 I am really rather bored now my dear for neither can I walk , nor venture with permission in a chair -- so I am obliged to make my enquiries of you in this manner -- I hope you have quite recover 'd the accident you met with not only I mean the wound on your wrist but the hurry it must have given your spirits -- I have heard of now by Anna Maria or I shd . have sent -- I think -- at least I then felt hurt that you wd . not tell me what it seems I was the only person ignorant of as it was impoſsible that it shd . the whole evening escape my observation & when I did discover it -- my fears magnified the matter -- & I impute to the alarm it gave me my foolish behaviour afterwards -- but it might have been the same for I was not the only foolish one of the Party & they had no excuse , my Compts . to Ld . N -- I hope he has recover 'd his composure of features -- I shd . like to have a little line from you this morng . as it wd . convince me yt . your hand was prety well but if it is the least troublesome to you to write I will hope that it is prety well if you send me a good account of yourself -- Adieu my sweet friend 10 .
