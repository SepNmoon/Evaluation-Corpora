Bristol Octbr . 30 1782 Thank you , my dear Madam for your gentle dun : You are the most agreeable Creditor I n ever knew , for you never bestow more pleasure than when you remind people of their debts , and it is in vain to plead want of ability to pay , when you are generous e nough to accept of whatever compoſition t he mental circumstances of the poor debtor e nable him to make . -- But -- to speak without a figure I really feel myself extremely obliged to your friendly interest and mediation in t he affair of poor Louisa . I thankfully restore the German narrative , which I shou 'd have rejoyc 'd to be able to read ; but the German language is among the many things I have the misfortune n ot to understand . -- Poor Louisa ! the same d ark cloud still seems to hang over her fate ; and her intellects . I think she is more stupid and leſs wild . I am afraid that is a bad sign ; Yet she has intervals of vivacity . I wish you cou 'd have seen the look She gave me the other day when I tied some white ribbons round her arms by way of bracelets , the only piece of finery she seems to have any relish for . It was such a look of wild delight as the best Actreſs may in vain endeavour to copy . I was glad to get Mrs. Sheridan 's Verses ; I had heard them spoken of , and in a strain of high commendation . I think them very pretty , and ( what is a still better thing in elegiac verses ) very tender . You mention Lord Stormont as poſseſsing an high degree of taste . I never was more inclined to be of your opinion ; our friend Lord Monboddo has aſsured me that he is the politest scholar among the Nobility ; and from the little I have seen of him I think him the most agreeable Man among them ; at least his sort of wit humour and literature are particularly to my taste , and embellished with a delightful gaiety . I am not a little proud at having made the same remark with the Queen ( you may be aſsured I do not mean to include that part of the remark which does me so much honour ) . Miſs Burney 's heroines wou 'd certainly be much better women , and brighter patterns , if their pure morals were perfected by piety , and if in their distreſses they looked for help where only it is to be found . This idea constantly occurring to me as I went along , diminished the pleasure I received , tho ' I never allowed myself to expreſs this opinion before , as it might have an invidious appearance . I was vastly surprised at your intelligence respecting dear Mrs. Carter . Methinks I am glad she was absent at the time of a certain preposterous solemnization . I hope the change of scene , and novelty of Objects will be of service to her spirits . -- The little girl you inquire after has a solid understanding and many good qualities , and I doubt not will make a sensible and accomplished woman . her temper has been a little hurt , but on the whole she is very good . -- I think with you that Theobald 's is perhaps the most readable , tho ' not the most critical Edition of Shakespeare ; but if I might venture to suggest a hint , I would observe that the pleasantest way of reading the Historical Plays , is to get them in single Plays , as Mr. Garrick acted them , particularly Richard the third , which , with all my blind Idolatry for Shakespeare , I must say is replete with the groſsest vulgarity a nd nonsense , which are intirely expunged i n that copy , and the Scenes reduced into b etter order . -- I grieve for my poor friends the Wilmot ; but tho ' justly incensed I hope they will r elent , as resentment can not undo the deed . All their friends have interceded for the poor offending girl ; as Lord Bathurst and Lord Mansfield have condescended to be among the number of Mediators , I hope they will not plead in vain . -- I have at last finished Adele et Theodore . You ask my opinion of it ; I am but an incompetent Critic , but methinks I shou 'd be glad to talk over this work in detail with you , as it is too complicated to admit of general strictures . In point of composition , I think it extremely well written . There is a fire and a spirit which c annot fail to interest and engage the affections . I think her plan more practicable than Rouſseau 's of on whose excellent Canvas however she she has laid some of her best colours ; and however she May affect to deny him I am convinced she would not have written near so well if he had not written before her . You will believe that I detest Rouſseau 's principles , but the energy the spirit and the graces of his composition , I never expect to see equalled . -- As to Madame Genlis her book has surely great merit , and I think she has attended more to cultivate the heart and rectify the temper than most writers on the subject . Her principles in general are sound , but now and then they are frightfully false and hollow ; She does not scruple to affirm , and that in a grave systematical way that a Lye may be told on great occasions , and to serve a friend ; a dangerous doctrine surely ! -- Then the false confidence that Miſs Bridget makes to Adele of her pretended marriage with Dainville offends me exceedingly . Her discretion and secrecy might be put to the severest proof without such a groſs violation of truth . Indeed I am sometimes inclined to suspect that the Author thinks Truth and Religion rather creditable , than neceſsary for their own sakes ; witneſs the pomp and ceremony of Adele 's first communion , which is represented as a human convention to make her a womanly and respectable character rather than as a religious duty . I dont like Miſs Bridget , a stiff ill humour 'd thing ! I suppose Madame Genlis thought that to have the spleen , to wear light stays , and to be very proud and morose was to make her a compleat English woman . -- Little Miſs Adele is quite the prominent figure , Master Theodore seems quite a subordinate little Gentleman , nor do I remember his ever figuring away , but when he repeats some Verses out of Milton at the Ambaſsadors . The little importance given to the learned languages in his Education revolts me . Without this foundation of ancient literature , the superstructure of true taste , will not in my poor judgment be compleat . But the part of her System I best like is what relates to the Prince , there is something extremely noble , in the sentiments and mode of Education of Baron Roseville . But I do not like so much intrigue and tracaſserie in a book of Education . All that relates to Madame de Valée and her Amours is surely not in its place ; in a profeſsed novel I shou 'd allow it to be extremely well written ; but on the whole I should have some objections to putting this book into the hands of young Girls . I am not mightily delighted with the expedient of singing duets to counteract sea sickneſs , an affectation which never can subdue real intense suffering . There is something so honorable in the Author 's activity and industry in compiling so many books for the Use of her pupils that it is almost ill-natured to object to that which has so much merit in it : But if they are continually obliged to read only her compositions , ( and it does not appear that they read any t hing else , how are they to acquire a knowledge of the style of other writers or to form their ow n. I confeſs I should be alarmed at so d angerous an experiment as putting all the b est written works on the side of Infidelity i nto the hands of a Girl of fourteen ; but to e xpect that a Girl of that Age shou 'd confute a ll the plausible Arguments of those Specious S ophists I own confounds all my notions of reason a nd probability . -- To give a Girl poison at f ourteen , because it may poſsibly fall in her way at thirty is the worst sort of inoculation for mischief I ever heard of . -- Then the training up the little Masters and Miſses for future little husbands and Wi f v es makes me sick and nothing can be so fade and insipi d and as their loves and marriages when they do take place . I am afraid I have written a little a-la Miſs Bridget , splenetic and hyper-critical ; but you insisted , and would be obeyed . After all I know it is easier to make an hundred ill natured remarks than to write the worst letter in that book . The history of the Ducheſs is it not incomparably well written throughout ? I do not know the moment when terror and pity have reigned in my heart with all their power so forcibly as when I read that story . It is a long while since my imagination has been so powerfully impreſsed . She paints with a strong pencil , and vivid colouring . -- You must be terribly at leisure to read such a volume as this ; it is almost a crime , as all your moments are consecrated to employmen t so honourable and so important : but the length of my letter is meant to atone for the length of my Silence . You will soon be going to Town , but I hope to get a letter from you first . Mrs. Garrick loves you always . She is a good friend but a bad correspondent , for she hates writing , yet she writes well . Believe me dear Madam Yr . faithful & obliged H More
