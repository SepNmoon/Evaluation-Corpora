38 , S t . James 's Street 22 d . Febry- 1803 Most unreasonable Sister , Do you really think that I have nothing to do , but to enquire about old Frumps ? Your Ld= N 's , & your Harpur 's , are alive . As I know neither the one , nor the other , You must not suppose , that I asked a second question about them . You do Garrick injustice , for really she has said nothing to Me , either about You , or Yours but what was perfectly right , and proper . She says , Ly . Cathcart & Princeſses often talk of You . As to the Queen ( in her own right ) I have not seen her . When I do , it is more than probable , that I shall never think of your Meſsage , about replying to her acknowledgment & c. & c. & c. Your Counteſs of Mansfield is hobbling about like an old Gander . He affected not to know exactly where You lived , when I told him , that I had visited You , but the conversation concluded with his saying , that he did believe he would go to Leighton House . Uncle Sir William ( Kenwood ) is with Child . I hope she will produce an Heir . Lady Mansfield is in the same state , and near her time , Lady Charlotte Drummond looks as like an old Woman , as ever , and Charles Greville is grown very fat . Your Sentiments and mine , about Town Residences , exactly agree . Had I remained with My Mamma , we should have been mutual torments to one another , and by the time I had paid her for my Board , Coals , Candles , and gratified her Servants , I suspect , I should not have found that there was much œconomy in the Plan . Here , I follow my own whims -- in Somerset Street , I must have given way a little to Hers . Tomorrow , I shall enter into the Forty Sixth Year of my Age . As it is the first day of Lent , the more proper will the opportunity be of bewailing my Iniquities ; and resolving to amend . As you are Ten years older than Me , it is high time that You should set about your Reformation too . Pray do n't delay it . Give my Love to your Husband & Robert Greville . Louisa s Boots , I presume , have hardly been dry , for these last ten days , as the Ground is sufficiently soft , for his favourite amusement . I wish him good Sport , and good health . Ever My Dear Sister , Your 's very Affectionately Mr. D . I hope my Countrywoman has had some good Apples , since I saw her . By the bye , you was to have given me a Comiſsion about Napier 's Ware ; what was i it ? Rib & Brats at Wilton Lodge , well , by the last Letters . London , Twenty Third Febry- 1803 Wedgewood Leighton House Beds . Mrs. Dickenson .
