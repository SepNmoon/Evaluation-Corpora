Wellington ½ past 7 Tuesday Evg 31 Augt My dearest friend -- I set out without any Companions & took in an outside paſsenger at Spinham Lands without recg any advantage -- he left me at Newberry Happily no unpleasant Reflections disturbed any solitary Meditations & this morning I got on the outside 12 Miles from Bath to enjoy the Scenery and at Bath took an outside place for this town to have a view of the Country wch- is new to me -- the road to Wells 20 miles is unpleasant on acct . of the tremendous Hills and it is neceſsary to drive down them wh- rapidity to make up for loſs of time & this requires a nervous apprentices help to be placidly reconciled to -- half a Mile from Wells there is the most beautiful Subject for a Landscape without Water that can be conceived -- how I wished for Louisa to sketch it -- from Wells to Glastonbury the road is charming 7 Miles -- the town is pretty & there are some curious Remains of an old Abbey , the Tower looks well on this side -- The road from Glastonbury to Bridgewater is perfectly good 13 miles -- the Mail is here obliged to make up for lost time & we frequently flitted ventre a terre for a mile or so -- there is a curious ridge on which the road runs for 2 or 3 miles which commands a magnificent prospect on each side -- Bridgewater is a pretty town -- we dined on a Coach dinner at Taunton at 6 OClock Taunton is a beautiful Town & then came here -- tantivy -- Since my arrival here I have been in a bit of a paſsion but as I am quiet now I will endeavour wh- Composure to tell you that there is not a Soul in this town who ever heard of Oakford -- I have been to the post Office -- Never heard of the place -- I have spoken to Gemmen in the street -- knew no such place -- The Landlord says he has a post Boy who must know it but he will not return till later so here have I been fuming & admiring all my Relations as the most discreet sensible people in the World -- to invite me to come 200 miles to pay them a visit to direct me to go to a Town & from there to take a Post Chaise & not know where to direct the Driver to direct his horse -- luckily I recollected Bampton is the Post Town & that place is 12 or 14 miles off -- so probably I shall have 20 miles to pay for -- from stupidity -- The Day has been remarkably calm & so am I -- very soon I shall drink a dish of Tea & go to bed & tomorrow Try to find out the family of Wiseacres -- I have been again to the post office & after a great deal of pains taking it seems settled that I must go to Tiverton 14 miles off in the first part of my wild Goose Chase -- which shall be put off till tomorrow -- I do n't feel at all fatigued & contrary to my expectations have had no spasms in my knee -- Your party is just aſsembling & I hope you will spend a pleasant Afternoon Adieu -- My very dear friend -- With best Love to our dear Girl & Kindest Regards to Morrison I am As I have been for 40 Years Most Tenderly & Affy Yrs .
