Albemarle Street May 2 d : 1786 My dear Miſs Glover I am well pleased , indeed , to hear that you like Mrs .. Dickenson I was in great hopes that she would suit you , she is very diffident & a sweet temper , which are two great qualities in a servant what who is in the capacity of a ladies maid . I can not tell the true meaning of Sarah Barrow 's verses , but the first time I see him I will ask him . I saw the Provost of Eton the other day , who was so good as to recommend a printer to me , a very sensible honest man a Mr Collier , I mean to imploy him the Provost was to write to him for me . Your Old Friend & Lover William Hayward Roberts has been in france for these last nine months , I should not be surprized if he was to continue there , he has been so shamefully treated by his children , I think I told you before you left Town that he kept a woman , his daughters Mr .. Hughes & Mr : Bourdieu sent spies to find the woman out , & told him that he was an old wretch & abused him so much that Phillipa threaten 'd to bring her home , his sons attack 'd him , even Hariot , who is really a sensible young man , but led away in this instance by his sister 's , I believe he is sorry no w that matters went so far ; his son Bourdieu reproach 'd him with living with their mother before he married her , he put his father into such a rage that he threw a glaſs of wine at him , & he swore he would disenherit them all , meaning James & John James & John , Phillipa is out of the scrape for she has been abroad near two years & my Mother s godchild Hariot is still at Nancy s she is a very sensible girl , my Mother intends writing to Mary to request his permiſsion to let her be with us during the holiydays , if she goes home her morals will be quite corrupted , for my dear Miſs Dutton wants steadineſs , she has naturally a sweet disposition , Mr .. Bourdieu himself wants steadineſs , if he had had any he never would have suffer 'd his children to have behav 'd in the manner they have . Mary has not been well , she went to Mr Bourdieu 's benefit , ( the only time she saw Miſs Hamilton this season ) & caught a cold in her head , after that left her , every night between six & seven she was seized with a hoarseneſs & a disagreeable short cough , Kemble & Mrs- Siddons have been uneas ie y about her , Mr . drank tea with us this day seven-night , Mrs. Hamilton was so unhappy about her that he could not leave her , I saw Mrs : H .. on Sunday & thought her better , but she was still a little hoarse , she thought herself too much better , I think her much improved this winter . -- I inclose a few lines for Mr : H—— to thank him for his kind epistle to me . My Mother is very well & desires her best love to you . You may remember that last year my dear Father gave me a thousand pounds , which was a debt that Miſs H : ow 'd him , in his will he very particularly mentions it as giving it to me with five thousand more , Since his death the bond which Mr .. D : gave him is miſsing , in short I can find it no where ; the first visit Mrs : Burges & Mrs : Burges paid us this winter my mother mentioned the bond which Mr acknowledged , still I received no interest from him though half a year was due last Lady day , about a fortnight ago Mrs. Strothoff who is our solicitor & our my trustee , call 'd upon them & mention 'd that I was in want of the interest upon the bond , Mr. Strothoff said their was nothing to show for the Money & that indeed she should not pay it . -- she told Mr. Blake the same , Mrs .. S .. said if that was the case he should file a bill in chancery against her , but however they both go to her on thursday to talk with her upon the subject , I always thought her a weak woman but did not think her a bad one , I no w think her both , we shall visit no more , some time ago we call & she told us to our faces that it was my poor Father who was the occasion of the will going into chancery that the executors had told her so , I took her up very short , ( for I was really angry ) they have then used us very ill Madam , since they all agreed that they could not act as the will then stood , finding me very positive she said you mistook me , I did not say so . I thought it beneath either my mother or myself to say any thing further on the subject , we took our leaves & I then told my Mother that nothing should ever tempt me to go within their door again . Mr. McKonochie is very much alter 'd we never see meet , surely their never was such a family , he has I think as bad a disposition as I ever heard of . Mr. Blake presents her best Compts . pray give my Mother 's Compts . to Richd Glover with mine Adieu my dear Mrs. Lenton & believe me your very Affectionate Lady Wake
