Wing Janry 2 d 1800 -- My dear Mrs Dickenson At last I send you the Magazines -- & with them a piece of intelligence which is so new to us both that we conclude it may be so to you -- Mrs John Hunter has Avow 'd her self the Authoreſs of the Series of P lays -- & one of them is now in preparation at Drury Lane -- it is also confirm 'd , that this had this Country has taken John Hunter under its immediate Protection -- pray asſure Grand in yr next that I shall Subscribe my pittance toward this new Tax -- not only with Submiſsion . but with cheerfulneſs . & readineſs -- did John Kemble tell you Yesterday , that Sarah Siddons is going to Claim the Dukedom of Hamilton -- from the Stories I heard from the poor Cardinal of York & from Henry from the Mouth of the present duke ( which Stories differ 'd materially as how & by what means Lord Stanley became Duke ) I did conceive that the lawyers wd Easily make out a Case which may fill their pockets -- We are glad you have heard from Elizabeth Hamilton I hope these Young ladies will never forget the kindneſs you & James Hamilton Shewed them in their melancholy circumstances -- I Hope this for their sakes . for I wish them well . at the same Time I think their prospect is but a gloomy one . it requires not only Steadineſs -- but great good Sense . for a Young pretty Girl with the Talents of Lady Charlotte Edwin to Conduct her self with Prudence in such a World , as London contains -- she , a perfect Stranger -- of an Age to believe any Profeſsion of regard made to her by the most Selfish . & often the most Unworthy -- in Short . it seems to me that nothing Short of a Miraculous interference can save those poor innocents & that such a wonderful instance of divine Mercy may be shewn to them all -- is the sincere wish of yr ever Affect Friend Dr Milman Love from all to both lord something Douglas is better -- Miſs W : Leighton House
