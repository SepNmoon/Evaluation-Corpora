1765 To Charles & To Mrs H My Dear Brother , Yours of the 14 th . of Jany . came safe to hand about a fortnight ago & found me at Florence where I return 'd some time before . I found great benefit as to my health by the mild air of Pisa , but as for any other advantage , society entertainment or even tolerable accommodation it is not to be found in that poor deserted & miserable country . However as my principal end of going there has been answerd I do not regret the may solitary days I paſs 'd . there As my health is now almost reestablish 'd I have but little inducement to think of prolonging my stay abroad , for to say the truth , things appear to me quite differently from what they did eight years ago , & I am now most thoroughly convinced that an English woman can not bear being transplanted into France or Italy unleſs she is determin 'd to accommodate herself to their respective customs , in which case she must first divest herself of decency & of every idea of right & propriety ; in short unleſs it is on account of health a woman can have no other proper inducement to continue in this country ; & a man en Famille must frequently find himself in ridiculous situations , these reflexions were not new to me before I came abroad , tho ' I did not think them of consequence enough to make me lay aside a plan which I thought my health and the state of mind I was then in absolutely requir 'd . Mrs. H . is now extremely happy as the material point is answerd , that I have considerd this matter in its proper light , in consequence of which I have fixed my departure from this place for the first of May next & hope to be in London by the middle of June . It will I know immediately occur to you what is your plan ? as I can never have any reserve with you I have no difficulty , but on the contrary a satisfaction in acquainting you with all my views , if they shou 'd appear to you improper , I know your affection for me will not permit you to conceal your sentiments . Not having any desire or even reason to expect further Preferment in Ireland I have many strong objections against fixing my residence in that Country it must then be somewhere in England , as that is the case , some place where I am at present totally unknown & where I shall not be perpetually reminded of former disagreeable situations or stumbled upon by Friends I do not want to see , is what is at present to be desir 'd & I think Norwich will answer my purpose in most of these particulars , as I remember to have heard formerly that it is a Town where there is good society the whole year ; it is you know in a very good Country & as it is a place of immense trade I conclude the markets must be good & reasonable , indeed I have heard that they are particularly so . If I shou 'd be further induced by your opinion upon this matter to make trial of that place , I mean to procure a letter of recommendation to some Person there , who will aſsist me in getting lodgings & c for to go there without having any one to whom I was known wou 'd be a very auckward situation . Do me the favor of acquainting Mrs. Pasham that Mrs. H . will take her Daughter under her own tuition in the beginning of July next , we can not sufficiently expreſs our obligations to you & Mrs. H . for your kind attention to her , I confeſs , my Affection for her increases daily & that I cou 'd not have thought that my happineſs cou 'd depend so much upon so young a personage -- Mrs. H . desires to be particularly rememberd to you & Mrs. H . She has been confined to her bed for near this fortnight past with the scarlet Fever a very dangerous disorder in this country the Fever & the irruption h a v r e now over but the Physiscian will insist upon her keeping the house for a month to come as relapses sometimes happen & are commonly fatal . I have wrote to my Banker in Dublin & hope he will observe my instructions that I may not be look 'd upon as a runaway Tenant ; it will now be unneceſsary for you to give Fetherston any instructions about our affair . A letter from you wrote ten days or a fortnight after the receipt of this , wou 'd be in time before I leave this place . Adieu Dr . Brother believe me ever Yours most faithfully & Affectionately Frederick Hamilton Florence Feby . 18 th . 1765 . A Monsr & amp ; c H . chez Carlo Hadfield a Florence Italie P.S . Our Child here is extremely well & has already had the small pox in a most favourable way , he is to be sent to London by sea from Leghorn in the Autumn .
