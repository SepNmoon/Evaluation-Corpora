Octbr . 23 d - 1779 I have to day heard your riding critisized by some Gentleman instead of followg the Hounds you follow the Stag -- you do not manage your Horse properly , & of consequence blew him -- a person said Mr. C told them he had taken the liberty to tell you so -- that you thanked him & stop 'd -- but in a few moments you set off & forgot his instructions -- I likewise heard you asked a Gentleman if the late Dk . of York had been a great Fox hunter & c & c you was answerd in the affirmative -- O then , you replied , You may depend upon it his Nephew will endeavour to Surpaſs him in all his actions I do not make comments but how do I wish you would be a little more upon your Guard -- you my friend are so situated that not an expreſsion or remark is or will be lost -- you can not enjoy ye . privilege of being unoticed -- You have my fervent wishes for yr happiness -- May ever day of your life be crowned with joy & gladneſs Adieu Adieu Will my friend pardon me if I add that I once heard a very sensible remark -- Those persons that excelled in Mimickary had no character of their own , & that ridiculing the foibles of others was the greatest proof of a weak understanding .
