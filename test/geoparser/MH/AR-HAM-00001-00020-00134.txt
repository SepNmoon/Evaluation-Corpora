Edinburgh 13 th . July 1796 . My Dear Sister , Delays being dangerous , and being about to set out to join my Regiment at Aberdeen this very day , I condescend to tell You that your three Huzza 's reached me within this half hour . Whether I shall bear my Faculties meekly , I know not . Hitherto I do not feel any remarkable change in myself ; but , I suppose , when I get amongst fine folks , I may grow fine too . You must know , that this Parliamenteering is not because I was very anxious about the matter , but because , I was obstinately determined to convince some of my ill wishers , that I could get in if I would . Perhaps , like my Namesake Sir Francis Wronghead , I may have cause to repent of my Vanity . Had Parliament met , I proposed going South , to take my Seat , and leave my Proxy , wishing to paſs the Winter Months at Wilton Lodge in glorious tranquility . But , Government having attended more to their own convenience than to mine , some little interference with my case & comfort is likely to happen . Our Commander in Chief has permitted me to leave Quarters the beginning of October , and you may be sure , I shall take advantage of this Leave as soon as I have signed the Returns on the first of October . My Troops marched from hence last Week , and will reach Aberdeen this day , and tomorrow . My Rib is at present in Yorkshire , and will be a Vagabond from home till September , as she proposes visiting her Brother at Widdrington Castle , for the purpose of Sea bathing , next Month . She has been very unwell , owing to a bad Miscarriage , the cause of which has not been discovered . It has made her very much thinner , and she still feels a considerable degree of weakneſs in her Knees when she walks . The change of Air , and Scene , has been of use , and I trust the bathing may restore her strength . The School , at which , I told you my eldest Daughter was placed , is given up , owing to the bad health of the Governeſs . This deranges some of our plans , but must be submitted to . I can easily conceive how uncomfortable it is , not to be settled in a house of your own , tho ' I rather think You like wandering about , & making Visits . That sort of Life would demolish me , being nearly as bad as Soldiering of which I have long been completely tired . And so We bid thee Farewell . Love & best wishes to Your better half , your Brat , & My Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister Your Affect . Brother Napier Edinbr Fourteenth July 1796 Mrs. Dickenson Birch Hall Manchester Napier .
