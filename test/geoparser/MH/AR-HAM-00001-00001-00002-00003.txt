My dear Miſs Hamilton . Experience goes a great way in this World , I find it with regret , that notwithstanding . all my envy I can not obtain that agreeable stile of writing Both You and Lady Charlotte Finch are poſseſsed of , I grieve and fret for days about it , but it avails me nothing else but making me diſsatisfied with myself . which is the true way of preventing my poor Head to make any real progreſs in such a desirable talent . I shall therefore renounce all claim to Elegance of stile and desire You to be contented with a very simple Natural way of writing , well meant at all times but making no pretentions whatever . having prepared You for this I may without the least fear of offending Your feelings upon that subject say any thing that occurs to me without being criticised , , ( I mean by that severely ) for a little will do me good as I love to improve/ , , Pray do not think me to Old for that for that it would be mortifying indeed . Oh how beautifull is the discription of Windsor Church , and how just all the remarks upon the founder of it , my inclination would lead me to copy the actions of this Marchant to in preference to some of the greatest Men of Our acquaintance whose Ideas are of spending money merely for the sake of being great , without considering that true greatneſs can not exist unleſs accompanied by goodneſs , for every action becomes more or leſs valuable i a ccording to the motive it arises from . Our amusements at Fairford are much the same they were last Year , the drives not quite so long , as on my account , which is indeed the only change that can be observed in Our way of living , for You know we deal not much in variety . toujours la même , is an amiable quality . I swear by it . and here I am against variety . but toujours Perdrix . is somewhat disagreable . and in this instance I am for some little change , pray should it not be so in our Society ? We both agree and say Yes ! but when it must not be , what is to be done then ? why to submit ! Well then I never refuse good advice , and therefore am determined to come in to every thing You can suggest upon that subject , thinking myself a being totally void of any wish or desire contrary to th e oppinion of those I live with . fully determined to promote the chearfulneſs and Amusements of those who are depend ent of on me , as a neceſsary ingredient towards happineſs as far as it can reasonably be obtained in this . World , human power will stretch no farther , whosever the Will may be . Now You would willingly know how the Wo rl d goes , upon that subject I have but little to say , Our Thursdays Court was thin and not a Person You interest Yourself about present , excepting Miſs Gunning who I find lives in the Neighbourhood of Windsor . Sir Robert is not to settle in Richmond this Summer . Lady Warwick is hardly ever mentioned , but there is a report that her arrival is to be followed by that of the Dowager Lady Carlisle , which makes her Son very uneasy , there may be various reasons for that , and had not his Lordship s little Wife been obliged to keep company with some body who shall be Nameleſs . I should have suspected that introducing her was the most sense great obstacle , but that can not be the case now . I am glad to find that Bathing does agree so well with You , pray continue it as long as You can , for I do hope it will be of use to Your health . Charlotte
