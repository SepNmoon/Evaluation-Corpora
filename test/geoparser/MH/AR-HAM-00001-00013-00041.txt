Octbr . 1786 Sunning Hill My Dear Miranda It is so long since I have put pen to paper , except on busineſs , that I have rather taken a dislike to it ; but I now can not refrain from wishing my Dearest Miranda joy on the expectation of her soon being a Mother ; Every sincere wish for your safety , & welfare , I beg of you to accept , as you may be sure that all your friends , will be anxious for you , but none more so , than my Self . I know you love me , & I dare say you wou 'd like to hear , how I have spent my Summer , very retired , but still chearful , & I hope in doing some good ; you have already been inform 'd how Mr. Bourdieu has , & is ill treated by five of his Children ; Mary the youngest girl , & who is my god-daughter , has a good disposition & a understanding , her I had with me for two months during her vacation , fearing that if she went home , she wou 'd be totally ruin 'd , I therefore hope , I have sav 'd her ; She is now return 'd to the Miſs Duttons ; & I flatter my self with good example , & kind treatment , it has made a proper impreſsion , upon her Young & tender mind ; which is a most pleasing reflection to me , as you may suppose . & since she left me , her Sister Anna-Marie is come to me , she has been at Bruſsels for near two years ; where she found out that her family are behaving in a most scandelous manner , when she returned home , they tried all means , to bring her over to the same way of thinking with themselves ; but she nobly withstood , both their intreaties , & menaces ; She was oblig 'd at last from ill treatment to fly from her father s House , to Mr. Chollet , who was so kind as to receive her ; I heard that she was much improv 'd , in every respect , which induced me to give her an invitation to my house where she now is ; but she far exceeds all the good accounts I had heard of her ; She is truly a most accomplish 'd & amiable Girl , with a sweetneſs of temper , that one does not often meet with ; I quite love her ; & have promis 'd her my protection , not only that , but my house shall be her home , till her father returns from Paris ; where he has been fifteen Months , upon that busineſs , that was to have brought him in ten thousand pound per year ; that part of the story you ca n't have forgot ; he has been expected home these six Months last past ; I am afraid this is a wild project , & not unlike himself ; my Dear Mr. Glover never approv 'd of it ; all this appears a just plea for his delay ; but my real sentiments are , that he has not resolution , & firmneſs , to doe himself justice , & those that deserve his future favors ; he certainly was a good father , & loved all his Children ; but he is a very faulty Man , I pitty him most sincerely in his present situation ; for at his return , there is no alternative , but he must shut his Doors against them . My Dear Miranda , this is a hard task for a Parent to perform . -- My young friend is not of Age till Febry . & when she was a Broad , from her prudence , & gen tle manner , got introduced , into the first familys , went to Court , & I am inform 'd left a great character behind her , & many Friends ; she liv 'd in some stile , which her father supported her in ; I make no doubt , that was a peice of pride in him , & very natural for her to like it ; I greatly admire her good sense , that She is not in the least set up by it . -- I hear but a very indifferent account of R : G : after receiving fourteen thousand pounds since his father s Death , appears to be a distreſs 'd Man ; we have not been upon speaking terms , since our busineſs was finish 'd ; but I am told he has remov 'd from his Old Lodging into a worse , or let a wretch . -- how perfectly did his poor Dear Father know him ; he always told me no one knew him , but himself ! I desire to be kindly rememberd to your better half pray let him know he has not been so lucky in recommending a Servant to me , as I was to you ; it makes me quite happy that she suit s you so well . God bless you my Dear Miranda with best compliments to the family E G My dear Mr Dickenson I have just time to thank you for your las t very kind letter , & to expreſs my best wishes for Mrs. D .. , I sh all be very anxious for her safety , my best love to her , I would have answer 'd her letter , but you are witneſs that I have not room .
