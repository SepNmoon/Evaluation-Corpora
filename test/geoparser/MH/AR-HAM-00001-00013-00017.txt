My Dear Miranda I must say I love my good Child ; & shall be happy to see her ; remember you are engag 'd to me on xmas day . I feal a little offended in not seeing you when I came to Town , but I forgive you -- your good Father will be glad to see his child ; he has not been quite as well this last Month , but I thank God he looks well : Mary has had a bowel complaint , which lasted three Days , She is now better but very low ; our friend Ann wants to fill up the Frank . -- Adieu -- E Glover Albemarle Street Decr : 15 th : 1783 Mrs. Lenton sends her Compts : Garte Glover Bulstrode Park Bucks
