Lower Lodge Friday Morg As I was anxious to hear how you was , I desired Mrs Cheveley to write a few lines by the Kings Post Chaise which went before I red your Letter , I am happy to hear my Dear that you are better & have no doubts but that you will be a good Child & take care of yourself , I wished to have wrote but till this Moment have not had one , yesterday I dedicated to settling every body & myself , & you will find us quite at home & I hope like us when you arrive , this House is really charming , I have been so much used to move from one habitation to another that I feel no inconvenience from it . God Bleſs you . take care of yourself , & remember , that I never did nor never shall think any thing troublesome that I do for you I wish you was here & well , mais pour le reste do not make yourself uneasy for I am perfectly well & most Afftly Yr MCGoldsworthy -- The Priſs desire their Love , Her M——y enquired how you were when I arrived I have not seen her since I red yr- Letter I have been obliged to have my Polonaise trimmed with Gauze -- I give you the Hint -- will you desire Devaynes to let me have the Receipt of the last Draughts that Turton ordered me , for he desired me & I forgot it --
