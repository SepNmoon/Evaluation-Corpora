Monday My dear Sister / I had intended writing to you had not the pleasing expectation of seeing you very soon quieted my conscience & allow 'd me to think without remorse of the days that paſsed by without one single line being sent to you by me -- My Father this morning received a letter from My B to tell us you meant to spend another week at Lady Wake s & I will not allow this evening to escape me without expreſsing my best thanks to the Miſs Wakes for their very charming and interesting notes in your letter . -- Thursday morning My Father was extremely flatterd , and few people have come to Birch that have not been honord with a sight of those agreeable testimonies in favour of his darling granddaughter . I beg you will also give my Respects to Ly Wake & aſsure her I feel myself honor 'd by her obliging remembrance of me . I am to write this letter very expeditiously for my F has been giving so many prudent reasons why it must be written to day , Thursday morning , that even a melancholy rainy morning with all it 's attendant horrors coud have no effect to prevail upon him to respite me but for one single day . I dont know whether you woud give me credit if I was to say it was partly for your sake I I wished to postpone writing , as the weather has an unaccountable effect upon my variable mind & you could expect neither energy nor entertainment were you to see the clouds & hear the wind that that my miserable senses are aſsaild with . Truly it is a day that the people of england hang & drown themselves in , & only that the canal is empty & that I have an insurmountable objection to being suspended , & do not know what the consequence woud be -- I have been very gay while the sun shone I aſsure you & have seized every paſsing minute that coud bestow the least delight ; on Monday I call 'd on Mrs : Robinson , Mrs : Lucas , Mrs : Yates , Mrs : Potter , Mrs : Worsley , & Mrs : Fisher I think I perform the evil of morning visiting with a dispatch worthy of myself ; on Tuesday I dined with my Father at Mr. Place s , Miſs P : returned with us : Yesterday We were all to have gone to the Highgrove to dine but unfortunately the morning was not favourable to the young Bachelors wishes so there perhaps was a conquest lost -- To day Thursday we dine by an invitation of a very long standing at Townsend how we shall get there remains for time to unfold , but if I have a dry thread left on me it is fully as much as I have a right to expect , to morrow I propose to drink tea with Mrs : Fisher and on Saturday am to meet a party at Mr : Robinson s -- If nothing unforseed prevents all this taking place , you will find I entering into what I shoud once have calld a diſsipated life . -- Mr Worsley is very indifferent & it is well if their is not an alteration of that house very soon . Mrs : W seem 'd in tolerable spirits when I last saw her ; she will be heartbroken if you do not come soon . He has medical men attending him every day . It is enough to wear her to a shadow to see those harbingers of death hovering about the house without intermiſsion . I shan t be afraid of her nerves being uneaqual to the fatigue & anxiety she must of course undergo . -- I have heard from Elizabeth & there is a letter from her to you they are arrived at Naples & she mentions with pleasure Sir W Hamilton s great attentions to them she has been alarm 'd about the babies being in danger of the small Pox , which in that hot Climate is very alarming at this season of the year . -- John Mellor s son at Mhy fold has got the Measles ; we went today & find he is doing very well ; this disease prevails in the country ; & indeed in so populous a Neighbourhood , to escape infectious diseases among children . My F desires Louisa may have some medicine before she comes down to purify her blood before change of Air -- I rejoice to hear that young Lady still continues to deserve so well the approbation of her friends ; we are all so interested about her , that to hear her praised is a cordial to ones spirits & makes us long to see her . Pray tell her Mrs : Patty has produced two kittens & had so artfully conceald them that it was very difficult to trace her to her little family . She is very plaintive & very hungry . Parker enjoys good health & spirits since corn became so scarce , I have mad an order that the dogs shall not live so luxuriously as usual he has found the benefits of this regulation , and is as lively & youthful as poſsible -- We have a Thrush in Birch Garden that will vie with all the Nightingales you have had your ears feasted with in the South The Barberries lament my Nieces absence , as they find it impoſsible to delay coming to perfection before her arrival to taste their sweetneſs The gooseberrys & currants tho ' vulgar fruits , bear a very promising appearance ; as for any other kinds the inexorable winds in the spring have prevented us having it in our power to boast of either quantity or delicacy of taste . Miſs Place is besieging me with her loquacity ; she sings , she talks , & laughs so intolerably that it is impoſsible to arrange one 's thought ; I have recommended to her to leave me but she has no mercy . I must therefore conclude in haste and aſsure you of my intense affection S Dickenson Remember me kindly to Miſs Morrison & tell her we shall rejoice to see her . Charles has contri ved to tumble of a haymow & has hurt his head . him yesterday to Mr : Thilles but he went to a nother person . he says he is better today -- I woud advise you to spend a week in some hi gh mountain in Derbyshire before you come to us to reconcile your eye to Birch after having dwelt so long on the luxurious beauties of Hampton & Pheasant Grove . We have few charms to boast of , & I have to lament daily the ravages the severity of last winter made among my plants . My Raspberry trees look very sickly indeed & poor Louisa 's Garden notwithstanding all grandpapa s good wishes is rather in a forlorn state . I gr udge every rose that appears & had I the power woud persuade them to stay till you come that we might look as agreeable as poſsible but as persuasion is not my forte , you must accept my good intentions instead of actual service -- Milly is here still I must be very peremptory indeed to convince her I wish her to leave us -- Poor Mrs : Lucas has again been unfortunate . My F who is Master of that subject recommends strongly to her to bathe in Rosew . in short he agrees with her medical advisers I have seen scarcely anything of Mrs : J Potter I hear she has been ill & I saw the Phillips 's one day and received a very kind invitation -- flour is £9:10:0 a load but trade goes delightfully well . The poor are all imployed & busy , which is the only thing to keep them out of mischief . Mr : Robinson is gone to London at a moments notice . I fancy to meet the fleet . I have left off eating bread at dinner & supper , & we have no pastry or puddings in which flour enters the composition . if every family woud relinquish their superfluities plenty woud soon return to us -- The fear of famine never presented itself to my Imagination , & I aſsure you it has been very active ever since . what woud become of us if the people have more to view ? but as the harvest has is in so forward a state , I trust there is no real ground for that fear . I believe provisions are more plentiful with us than in any part of the Kingdom so do not fear being quite famishd amongst us . The garden is very productive & Miſs Morrison shall have Barley Soup in the worst of times I really hope to see you very soon I must go and dreſs for this adventurous expedition of ours it still rains & is gloomy as ever . Adieu my dear sister -- Love to my B . -- Kiss Louisa for me -- It is so cold that I have been obliged to go down to the fire to warm myself whilst I was writing -- Miſs D . -- 1795 June Mrs : Dickenson Ly .
