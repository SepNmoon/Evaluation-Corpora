My Dear Miſs Hamilton Mama 's being prevented writing is the reason I trouble you with this to say how sorry We both are that we can not meet you at Sir Wm Hamilton 's tomorrow , as other People & their busineſs depend upon us -- if it had only depended on ourselves we should have put off any thing with pleasure . we are much obliged to you for endeavouring to procure us a sight of this Vase Pray excuse the Scrawl I send but I am attending my Neice in her Musick Leſson & have my ears so full of Crotchetts & quavers I hardly know what I write . I shall hope for the pleasure of seeing you next Friday & am my dear Miſs Hamilton your obliged Hble . Servt . Sophia Penn
