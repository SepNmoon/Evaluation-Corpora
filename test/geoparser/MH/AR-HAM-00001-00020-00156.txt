11 , S t . James 's Street 7 th - March 1801 . My Dear Sister , When you desire me to frank your Letters , I wish you would write their Addreſses in a legible character . Mrs- Bliſset , Bleſset , or Bloſset , may perhaps receive the letter you sent me , as I endeavoured to imitate your Chinese Characters as well as I could , and I took this bad pen , for the purpose of making the imitation more correct . As to our beloved King , I believe his complaint has been a Brain Fever , but I never heard a word of what you mention . The report , of the Physicians , to day is “ His “ Majesty 's Fever , is so much abated “ as to give the fairest prospect of his “ speedy recovery ” -- For which , I most sincerely thank God . All my hopes & prospects are at present obnubilated . Whenever they begin to clarify , if I am in a good humour , perhaps I may tell you . As to my Plans or motions , I can say nothing at present . So Adieu . Love to your Husband , Brat , & my Countrywoman . Ever My Dear Sister , Your faithful & Affecte . Brother Napier I saw Sir Wm . Hamilton crawling along Piccadilly , the other day . His Lady drove down S t . James 's Street about two hours ago , The Greville Mansfield , I have not seen lately , but am asked to an At Home at the Portland Place Counteſs es on Wednesday . I dont like these unsubstantial Invitations -- London , Seventh March 1801 . Mrs. Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds . Napier .
