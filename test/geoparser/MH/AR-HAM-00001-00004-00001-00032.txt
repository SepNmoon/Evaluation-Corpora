Dear Mrs. Dickenson I am extremely obliged to you for a brace of very fine Grouse which I received on Saturday morning in perfect order . I am glad to hear that you are so soon to have the pleasure of Mr. Dickenson 's return . I hope he has received all the benefit he expected by the Bath waters . Robert arrived here from Germany three weeks ago last Saturday , & is so much grown that when he came into the Room I hardly knew him , being near 5 feet 10 inches in stature , & perfectly strait . You may remember there was an idea that he had been in England some time ago with Mr. Fabricius which he denied very positively , as Robert does also to my perfect conviction . He has not been attended to by any means in the manner I had a right to expect which upon his complaints , was the reason of my bringing him home . he is this day 18 complete & is now labouring with great diligence to make himself fit for his new station , in point of figure he will be thought a capital Recruit , & as he is well disposed I am inclined to hope that I shall not be ashamed of him . Jane received your letter some days ago , & will soon write to you herself to thank you for it . My Family in general desire to be affectionately remember 'd to you & Mr. Dickenson I remain Dear Madam Your faithful Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street N o . 249 August 17 th . 1789 . P.S . Mr Greville 's being in Town is always so uncertain , that any letters that you may intend to favor me with , I wou 'd by no means have enclosed to him
