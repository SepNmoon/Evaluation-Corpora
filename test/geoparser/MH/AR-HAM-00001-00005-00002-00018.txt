Park Street 110 Grosvr . Sqr- Febry My Dear Mrs. Dickenson anxious to know how you are in health and spirits , will plead apology for teazing you with a letter when perhaps you are better engaged than to read a dull letter scrall but I flatter 'd myself to have had a letter from you on coming to town the end of last month as since your last I have not been satisfied about you -- Nervous complaints are so teazing and lingering that I feel distreſst about you having seen so much of them in those I loved -- therefore pray let me have a few lines I try to comfort myself with the often true idea : no news , good news : but it dont always satisfie me -- We left Scotland in very severe weather the ground cover 'd with Snow and the ice six inches deep , it was very favorable for our travelling as it smooth 'd the rough roads and enabled us to come in four days & half from Edinbr . with the greatest ease ; my Sister who had grown fat and enjoyed better health than for several years back unfortunately took a cold by a cold bed at Bowroughbridge which has given her furr and relaxation & c so that she has kept house ever since she came home but is now getting better and goes out of airing in a morning -- as among other complaints she was very deaff , it confined me at home very much , it being so uncomfortable to leave her , therefore dont expect much acount of the Grand-Monde for I am only preparing to look at it -- can only tell you coming from our fine clear air sharp and cold into this smokey region with weather that would be pleasant and suitable to April , makes me so hot that was not other people in the same case I should be alarmed and think I had a fever -- but joking apart I dont recollect such at this season of ye year , sunday , last : Kensington Gardens was crouded , as well as the park , every body sitting on the Wall and Benches , Men walking with Hats in their hands and others carring the ladies Muffs who having dreſst for Feb : did not know what to do when they came to walk in so hot a sun , every thing but the bare trees made me think it a summer day : the weather has continued as fine every since but the wind a little cooler -- poor Lady Frances Harpur is to be pitied , but I think spite of the Methodism which has suported her so long and well she must feel : supose you know Sir Henry went to the sea side I think East-bourn and then saw Miſs Monson s maid , took an attatchment and carried her off : after the birth of a daughter he wrote for a special licence , which was refused as it was unusual to grant unleſs with Familly consent -- upon which Lady Frances wrote to the ArchBishop saying her son had always been so good to her that she could not stand in the way of any thing that would conduce to his happineſs that indeed she thought it the only recompense he could make the Young Woman , and that he had so much good sence that he must be the best judge of what would make him happy -- it is said he intends to live altogether in the country and retired having rather refused with hauteur the compt : that the familly offerr 'd him ; of visiting and receiving his Lady -- our new Dutcheſs I have not yet seen -- report says she is very pleasing , very little and very civil -- that she makes a better Curtsey than has been seen at court a long time -- but her health is very delicate and she can not enter into the hours : so has her dinner between two and three ; sups when He dines , and goes to bed when he goes out for his evening amusement -- so that she finds London very dull , and dislikes their new house very much -- which I dont wonder at -- was always surprised at their changeing , for surely she need not have brought such an adition to the familly as that a house built for the Duke of York would not hold her -- after all this , tis no wonder they say she dislikes England and wishes to go back : indeed it would be the wisest thing they could do , as H. R. H . chuses to frequent Brookes 's and loses large sums -- which I think he should always do , for as he has contracted the extrordinary method of receiving when he wins and not paying when he loses : nobody ought to play with him but when he loses -- but if this continues to be sure they will cutt , it is imagined and he had better go to Germany and take up his Dignity as Bishop -- have you heard of Sir William Hamilton since at Naples , and if she enters into the Grand-monde -- it might be happier for both perhaps if she declines it it is said , the King made him a speech when He told him he was married that must have surprised him the Queen bowed , and said nothing the Dutcheſs of Marlbro ' has at last seen Lady Blandford so all parties are happy . the Old Dutcheſs of Bedford still lives and is unoticed by those who ought to take care of her for it is certainly extrordinary in the Childish state she is in for none of them to take care of her and prevent her exposeing herself Mrs. Leland our old friend has taken a new lease , having made a Tour into Somersetshire last summer and left her complaints behind her , the General you know is on the Staff in Ireland : that commiſsion ends in Octr : so he will not visit London this winter -- I wish I had more news to send you : but as I wish to ask how you do , and as that is the intent of this letter , will not apologise for its stupidity ; my Sister and Husband joyn me in compts and best wishes to yourself Mr. Dickenson and La Charmante Louise which concludes me my Dear Madam Yours very sincerely Wilhelmina Murray
