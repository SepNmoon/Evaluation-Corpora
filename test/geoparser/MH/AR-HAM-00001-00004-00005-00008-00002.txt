During the fine part of the day , We generally travel 'd in a Phaeton , & our Post Chaise follow 'd ; after having chang 'd horses at a Place call 'd Montefiasconi , our Postillion wanted to have the Wheel ( which had been dragg 'd ) unlock 'd , Our Courier was gone on , & the Postillion was getting down to do it , but Sr. Wm . order 'd the fellow to stay till the Other Carriage with the Servants came up , that one of them might do it ( not to have the horses left alone ) he was however obstinate & left them , in Consequence of which they set off with us so furiously , that we could scarce keep Ourselves in the Chaise -- Sr. Wm . seeing the Courier hollow 'd to him , he turn 'd , seeing our distreſs immediately leap 'd off his horse , jump 'd out of his Jack boots , & waited at the point of a hill to stop the horses while the weight was against them , he made a Spring & unluckilly miſs 'd , at the second Spring he caught them , & tried to turn them , but the ( weight of ) the weight of the Carriage being turn 'd the point of the hill / made it impoſsible -- notwithstanding which Our brave Courier , tho ' he might have saved himself , wou 'd not quit us , he determined to perish or or save us , & having run holding the bridle as long as he could he hung himself to it , & was carried away with Us till that broke , & he was trod down by the horses , We after met his horse whom we threw down & went over this gave the alarm to some Peasants in a field , who came out with hats & Cloaks & frighten 'd our horses , who instead of stopping , turn 'd to the left & sprung Phaeton & all over a ditch ; We were so near over that a dog of Ours was thrown at a great distance , We got then into a plough 'd field , where these furious Animals were galloping toward a precipice , but the loose ground making the Carriage heavier , the Peasants had then time to come , & Seize them -- but judge of our Affliction , when the first object we saw , was the poor fellow , who had shewn so much Courage and Attachment to us , to all Appearance lifeleſs on the Ground , We run to him , & found however that he was still living , but We had gone over his Collar bone & Breast & the horse had kick 'd him in the face that his Eye was quite laid open -- We got what help we could , & had him blooded on the Spot , & then carried into the town ; We were for some time in doubt whether he had not received inward hurts , however , thank God , we were soon satisfied that the poor Man ( t o whom we ow 'd so much ) was out of danger tho ' he had twenty Cuts upon his head , his eye terribly cut , his collar-bone broke , his body all over bruis 'd , and his legs cover 'd with the kicks he got from the horse to whose bridle he hung . We went on when we were satisfy 'd of his safety & waited for him at Rome , & he was well enough to come here with Us , as We came gently & put him into a Chaise --
