Worcester 7 th . Janry . 1782 My Dear Sister , As I have not seen your departure from this Life announced in the Newspapers , I shall venture to enquire how you do , and what you are doing . I was in hopes to have made this enquiry in person , but that Jilt Fortune ( who by the bye never was a friend of mine ) has put it out of my power to make a Trip to London this Winter -- All my hopes in the Lottery were blasted ; the Tickets I was concerned in , having been drawn Blanks . I wished to have been rich enough to have paid my Duty to Her Majesty at the Birthday , and could I have collected £100 , I should have spent a Month or Six Weeks in Town . My attempts in Recruiting have not met with the Succeſs I expected . Should this continue to be the case , I shall probably be removed in the Spring . Chelmsford will then be the place I should desire to be sent to . Worcester proves a very agreable Winter Quarter . Many of the Prebendary 's are now arrived , who give good Dinners . They have been so civil as to require my aſsistance at several of their Feeds . In summer the people of the County collect at Malvern , for the benefit of the Air & Water . I do not recollect to have heard you mention whether you have been in Wor——shire or not ? The view into Herefordshire from the Top of Malvern Hill is one of the most pleasing prospects , I have ever seen The Ground is prettily broke into little Hills covered with Apple Trees . In spring the beauty & richneſs of the bloſsoms are not to be described . Wor——shire is well wooded and watered , but to a person accustomed to Hertfordshire , looks rather bare . I have enquired after Natural Curiosities for You but without Succeſs . It does not seem to be the Genius of my acquaintances here to make those collections I long to hear from You . Politics have lately become the darling topic of conversation . You may easily beleive that I felt particularly for Lord Cornwallis 's misfortunes . The Newspapers some time ago mentioned his arrival in England . Our Politicians are impatient to hear his opinion of American Affairs . Adieu . My Dear Sister . Beleive me ever Your very Affectionate Brother N——
