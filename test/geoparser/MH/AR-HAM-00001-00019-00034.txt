Canterbury Feby 23 d 1773 I Received My dearest Mary s letter of the 19 th - instant last post with one from Mr Hope inclosed but whither my time will permit me to anſwer his at present or not I am not ſure as he must give way to you in my writing but I shall do every thing to anſwer both -- You deſire particularly to know how long we stay here I can not just anſwer that question but imagine but a few days as I have applied to march & I have good reaſon to suppose that I 'll be indulged in it as its for the good of the Service , but as to the franks altho derected here you may do as follows supposing we go to Maidstone or any other place . The derection to Col Napier at Canterbury gone to Maidstone wrote by yourself always paſses taking care to just put a stroke only thro Canterbury leaving it legible as I have done in the inside of the Frank I send this in to shew you the method , they have always gone safe & free & I have much experience of it as we change quarters so very often & as you ſay you have an oppertunity to get franks get a dozen derected for yr self as I have but three left after this one nor do I know where to get any at present no Member being in this Country nor likely to be for ſome months -- Never My dearest Girl be at the trouble to ma ke any apology to me for not writing me immediately when receiving mine I am always happy to hear from you but only when it ſuits your own conveniency force meat is disagreeable & I am now quite convinced of your Friendſhip & I am ſure you 'll write me when you can , I own the oftner the better as nothing makes me so happy as your letters does as you are my most valuable Correspondant & the only one I speak my real ſentiments too for many reaſons . My Ague complaints are all gone thank God & I am as well as I expect to be till I have a few weeks of Buxton this ſummer which I am in hopes with care will make me a new Man again . equall mine My Father by the last Account is much better & I hope by to nights post to hear he is quite out of danger . Mrs Napier know very well the great Love , regard , & Friendſhip , I have for My dearest Girl & believe me she is not wanting in all the three to you either but I wont give up to her so far as to ſay that hers equals mine , she does not know my dear Ward half so well as her Guardian otherwise I make no doubt but she would almost equall mine but its impoſsible to come up to that by any woman that ever existed to another of the ſame Sex . Whither the Regiment comes to Northampton or not I shall be there & will stay ſome days to you in my way to Buxton to which place I am in hopes to perswaded Mrs Hamilton to go for a few weeks as I think it would do her good and I am ſure it would for you , as to be quite shut up in Northampton is not the thing for an accomplished young Lady , but I shall say nothing more on the ſubject 'till we meet & then we can talk all those things over at our leiſure , and had the Regiment been to be quartered with you I should have been from it , however its not as yet settled where we are to go tho in my opinion we 'll go to Eſsex & Suffolk but we will ſoon now know exactly as I expect every day the orders for the Armys years quarters wh- is always given out abt this time . It gives me real pleaſure to find My dearest Mary agrees with me about attachments especially at first sight , which sanguine people are more apt to be effected with , than those of a leſs sanguine disposition & if I am not greatly mistaken My Dearest Girl has a good deal of the first which shews a good heart tho oftner happens to be imposed upon by cunning deſigning people at first but a little acquaintance with them shew them without disguise which gives a little uneaſineſs at first to an honest heart but good ſenſe at last gets the better & things return to there first channel again with a reſolution to be more carefull for ye future . You have most certainly My dear Mary laid down a very right plan in paſsing thro life Viz to find no fault , to depriccate no body , and to be carefull what we ſay & by doing that , we have the chance to create fewer enemy 's ( for an Angell from Heaven will have ſome in this World ) & are more able to see the folly of other people which we ought always to observe on purpose to correct any of our own foibles as none in this age is without & happy are they that has the fewest , You deſire to know whither we ought not to beware of the conceited people whither they affected the Hble- or supercilious stile I say certainly and likeways to be on our guard against every person till we know them well , affability , politeneſs , & good nature to every body may most certainly be carried on , without entering into any friendſhip or Attachment what soever but when throughly known our own sense must be our guide how far we ought to enter into connexions which may makes us miserable for Life & in my opinion we ought to enter into none with either Sex without mature deliberation stating to ourselves the good & bad consequences that may happen by indulging ſuch & such attachments , thus My dearest Ward have I told you my opinion sincerely in what you deſired & shall be very happy to find you agree with me as it certainly will strengthen my opinion to myself greatly -- Mr Hope may imagine he is a more punctual Correspondant than you if he pleaſes but I must aſsure you he never will be so favored a one by me pray My dear Girl barr the door when you write next & keep out your Miſses they are hatefull animals all the World over but more so at Northampton to me , when they deprive me of having a long letter from my favorite Girl -- I have left myself little or no time to dreſs for dinner but if I have any time between this & the post going out I must just write a few lines to Jack Hope Adieu My dearest Mary remember me to Mrs Hamilton & believe me unchangeable My dearest ward s most affectionately hers
