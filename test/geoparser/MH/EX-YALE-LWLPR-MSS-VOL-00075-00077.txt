Windsor 21 Septr- 1786 indeed my Dear Mrs Dickenson I must appear both unkind and uncivil to have been so long without acknowledging your very kind and obliging Letter -- but I aſsure you that has not been the case -- Coud I write for my Self I shoud more frequently send you testimonies of my rememberance and affection but my Secratary having many occupations to call Her away from that office and several inquiring Freinds to satisfy makes it impoſsible to be as regular as I wish in my answers -- -- my Niece I thank god has now quite recoverd the Langour that she Sufferd for some time after the Measles she has now so much time to recover with Her Masters -- which I can not break in upon -- that she is of no use to me in writing -- I have the satisfaction to aſsure you that she improves very much and begs I will make Her particular Compts to you and Mr Dickenson -- the amiable and worthy Miſs Burney is Establish 'd much to Her satisfaction much approved of by Every body -- Especially by those she wishes most to Please -- I certainly am very happy in Her being Placed so near me -- which gives me an opportunity of seing Her often tho ' Her Visits are generally short . and she has so many absent Freinds to consider that all Her Spare time is scarsly sufficient to satisfy their different demands -- never any body was better Calculated for the Post she is now in as no part of the confinement is disagreeable to Her This moment my girl is steped in to my Chaise to call Lady Louisa Clayton who is to Chaperon Her to Maidenhead Races which began yesterday -- it is reported and I believe not without foundation that Miſs Clayton ( Mr Clayton s Daughter ) by His first Wife ) is to be married to Catherine Clayton who bears a very good Character and has shown a steady attachment to Her -- she has a good fortune is sensible and agreeable -- and His circumstances I suppose are approved of by Her Friends -- I know my Dear Friend is anxious to know how my shatter 'd frame goes on I feel that decline which I might have Expected many years ago -- but much I owe to Provedence for the support and Comforts I dayly Experience -- I am now recovering from a Langour that often Seizes me and warns me of what is to come -- yesterday morning I ventured to Early Prayers I went in my chair which I do n't do when I am in my best Health -- after Prayers were over and Collnl Fox and the King had with their usual Condescen sion taken notise of those they Paſsd by -- Queen took me by the hand and said is my Dear Her Majesty well enough to go with us to the Lodge to Breakfast -- to which you may believe I with Pleasure and gratitude Consented to -- and after having Breakfasted with the bright Constellation composd of Mrs Delany and 5 Princeſses I saw them all depart in their Coaches for Kew the Coronation Day is to be Kept on Friday and the return again on Saturday . I own I shall be glad when the day returns -- for when the flag -- does not appear on the round tower Windsor is dismal to me -- their Majesties is much recoverd I hope in a way of being quite well but they are Cautious and dont suffer Her to use any great Exersise -- She is very Amiable and I some times spend an evening with Her at the Lower Lodge -- I have been much shoked by the Death of Princeſs Eliz ' which has been very unexpected as she was Ill but one hour before she died -- she is a very great loſs to all those she was Connected with Particularly to my good and never failing Friend Mrs Fountain -- I have frequently had accounts from my nephews of their agreeable Freinds Mr F Montagu & Mr always happy when they had an opportunity of enjoying their Conversation s no wonder the Death of Mrs Dickenson is universally Lamented -- the Marchioneſs of Graham was one day last week brought to bed of a second Son -- and I am giving to write to dear Lady St Asaph to Congratulate Her -- I had a Letter last Post from Badminton from Lady Weymouth were she is happy with 9 grandchildren about Her besids Sons and Daughters when I write I will obey your Commands -- I suppose you hear Constantly from Mrs Boscawen and have better information then I have lately And I fear my much respected Friend Lady Cremone is in a declining state not as to His intelects -- but suffering great Ruins from Rheumatism and Sleepleſs Nights -- tho ' I coud fill a Page or two more were I as able as willing -- I find I can dictate no longer -- but what Ever Feelings I am sensible of -- nothing will diminish the Esteem and affection and warm wishes of My Dear Madam your most affectionate and Obligd Lord Mansfield I am much flatterd with MDelany s Partiallity Pray make my very Particular Compts to Him -- to hear of your mutual Happineſs will always give me Pleasure we will settle about the Catalogue when we Meet Septr . 1786 Mr Dickenson
