Teston near Maidstone June 8 th . 1784 I have at last sent You , my dear friend , the Nonsense you desired ; You remember , I hope , the hard Conditions on which you obtained my promise to give it you , namely that You were to copy it for yourself , and send this Copy to our dear Mrs. Carter or vice versa : it was a hard bargain and I pity You . I am so delighted with every thing and Person in this place that I have wished for you more than once since I have been here . I was so ignorant and unjust As to fancy that Kent was not a fine County , but I heartily recant . Nothing can be more pastoral and pleasant than this Situation ; nor more rational and delightful than the manner of living in this Mansion . I never saw more unaffected piety in principle , set off and illustrated by more practical charity and goodneſs . There is a little room in the Park devoted to the reception of sick beggars , many a wretched wayfaring Woman comes there to lie in , and many a houseleſs Vagrant to die . After our social rides and walks are over , I wander out by myself late in the Evening to enjoy the Honeysuckles and the Nightingales , in all the Luxury of Solitude s ; those good Natured little Extempore Poets have not yet done singing , and I have a prodigious paſsion for them . To day we are going to drink Tea with Lady Harriet Conyers ; to morrow we go to the Bishop of Chester 's ; he has a sweet Parsonage three miles from hence where he lives in all the primitive simplicity of a little Country Clergyman . I shall go to hear him preach on Sunday which he constantly does ; and so good and kind is he that he will preach for a sick Curate any where about the Country . I have undertaken to read Miſs Seward 's Louisa to the Company , I have only got half way thro ' it , and it is amusing enough to hear the different Criticisms , and to see the different effects the Poem has upon my Audience , some crying and some censuring . This is my third time of going thro ' it , no cold Eloge I think . Indeed s it exhibits a glowing imagination , and there is a great deal of good Picturesque description There are two paſsages , which I think wou 'd have come better from the Pen of a Man if they must have been written at all . I dont think I am a Prude , but yet I think I wou 'd rather not write quite so well on certain Subjects ; I like alway s to see the Author the Subordinate Char acter the Woman shou 'd still be the first ; bu t I suppose there is an impulse in grea t Talents and high Sensibility which it is har d for people who really poſseſs them to restrain and it is easy for me to censure the overflowings of an Imagination I do not poſseſs . -- Write to me and let me know who you have seen , and what parties you hav e been at -- We shall stay here till Monda y Morning . Adieu my dear friend -- I am going to see a very fine Conservatory in this neighbourhood so must bid you farewell H More
