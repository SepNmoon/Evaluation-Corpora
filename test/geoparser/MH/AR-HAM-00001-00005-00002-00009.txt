KenWood July 21 st : 1785 Pray My Dear Madam aſsure our ever dear Miſs A Murray that our Hearts bleed for her , the manner in which you say she supports herself under the severest blow she cd poſsibly receive , is truly wonderful , & only serves to confirm us in the opinion we have long had , that her Mind was much above the common stamp , her bestowing a moments thought upon us , in the midst of her own very severe affliction , is what we could not have expected , & shall ever be remembered with gratitude ; I hope she does not suppose we could have been so many Days without making particular inquiries after her , we sent immediately to Mrs Delany , & afterwards to S t : James 's Place , but with orders she should not be troubled with the meſsage ; my Sister & I are the only part of the Family now at home , we heard the Melancholy event in the most unprepared & unexpected manner , & were as you may conceive shocked beyond expreſsion , it is unneceſsary to dwell upon our own feelings , because as you rightly observe , it was impoſsible to know the many great , amiable , & respectable qualities of our dear departed Friend , without deploring our loſs , or being convinced there are few such left . I hear Miſs Thynne has behaved in the kindest & most affectionate manner to the Duke of Portland , which certainly does his Grace great honour , & shows him to have the good Heart , one might expect the Son of such a Mother as his , would poſseſs . be so good to thank dear Mrs Delany for the kind permiſsion she gives us to wait upon her , & to say that we shall readily make use of it the first moment in our power , but 'till Mrs Delany returns from the Circuit , we have no Equipage ; I take for granted she has already seen Ld Mansfield , who was here last night in the deepest Affliction , & intended calling on her worthy Friend this morning . I hope this blow has not affected your health , My Dear Madam , beg you to accept our most sincere good wishes , & to believe me , very affectionately Your 's Mrs Boscawen A : Murray Kenwood 31 July 85 -- Death of Hle .
