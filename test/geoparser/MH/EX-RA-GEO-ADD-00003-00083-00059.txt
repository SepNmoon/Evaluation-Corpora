As you so strongly recommend diſsipation I desire to know you will please to tell me in wht . line I am to adopt , or whose bright example I am to follow in ye . train of fashion & folly I am to persue -- I think this highly neceſsary , for if by chance my name should rise high in ye . Ton -- you can then take the credit of ye . applause I gain , & may expect my grateful acknowledgements -- if by contamination I lose not the sense of that virtue -- -- so -- You see my frd . I am worthy of yr- friendship & confidences -- when that ceases -- you will hear no more of me & we shall be then separated for Ever --
