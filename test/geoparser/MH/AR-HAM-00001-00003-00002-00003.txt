Naples , May 1 st : 1802 At length , my Dear Sister , we may be said to be drawn nearer to each other by the general Peace , as for many years we seem to have been separated more by the unhappy & desolating War than by the Alps , & distant tracts , wch : are plac 'd between this country & my dear Native land . It is also to the ever-lamentable revolutions which have not only pervaded & convuls 'd all Europe but almost the whole World , that you must attribute any seeming negligence of mine towards such good Friends ; but tho ' you have , without doubt , suffer 'd in Engd : the effects of this general vain & intollerable confusion , yet you can have but little idea of what weaker & more defenceleſs & ill- govern 'd countries have undergone & will have to regret for many many years to come ; I shall not however prolong this subject , which never fails to recall the most painful ideas , & have only touch 'd on it in order to plead my excuse , for never having written immediately to yourself , to thank you , my Bror : & my amiable Niece , for the kind & acceptable present I recd : in the beginning of the year 1801 . In order to render more secure your having my acknowledgements , with every proper expreſsion of gratitude , I begg 'd our Dear Sarah wou 'd not fail to write to you very particularly on this subject ; & she has aſsur 'd me that , to the best of her memory , she had done so : but for several years past it has been difficult to ascertain any point , owing to the uncertainty of the Post , & the actual interruption of all correspondence I believe I have now to redouble my thanks as I have lately recd : the sum of 8 guineas from England ; but not having had any letter from my Sister I am left to gueſs the generous hand it comes from : Be aſsur 'd my heart is very sensible to the kindneſs of all my Friends ; who have still the goodneſs not only to keep me in their remembrance , but also to confer benefits on me . Now that Commerce is restor 'd to Europe I shall frequently have opportunities of sending to Liverpool , wch : wou 'd be very pleasing to me indeed , cou 'd I be able to send you any thing from hence wch : cou 'd be agreeable or useful to you , but here again I am limited to the smallest trifles , wch : can only be entred into Engd : by the aid of some obliging Captn : of a ship , who can find means to get them privately on shore , without causing my Freinds to pay more for the duties than they are worth I have , for some years been anxious to send some little token of remembrance to my sweet Louisa , to keep for the sake of Aunt Ippa , for whom my Sister informs me she still retains a regard ; & I cou 'd have wish 'd to send you several curiosities which I obtain 'd on purpose , but which have been lost or ruin 'd by change of place & c , as the hope of being able to send them to you was so near at an end ; particularly as your present residence is now remote from Manchester . It luckily happens that I have an opporty : of sending to Liverpool , at the same time that my sister tells me you are expected at B . Hall ; so that I have hastily done some cuttings out , wch : wou 'd have been better executed had I had more time , & stronger eyes ; however the Bomboliera I have sent Louisa may serve as a specimen of my work , & is indeed a greater proof of my affection than the most elegant keep-sake I cou 'd have sent , on account of the weakneſs of my sight , when I am a Nurse , & the almost impoſsibility of obtaining time , & quiet moments to employ myself in such an art . You must excuse me my dear Sister , that to you , to whom I owe so much gratitude , I venture to send you so simple a token of remembrance as a piece of cold marble , but tho freezing to the touch , you must be told that this comes from a very warm heart , no leſs than that of the fam 'd Mount Vesuvius , whose productions can not be disdain 'd by a lover of nature & natural curiosities . These specimens of lava which but ill reppresent the mountain , sea , & light-house at Naples , were actually thrown up in the time of the eruptions , so that I hope you will not dislike it . I have sent also some ashes found in our garden in the last great eruption , & wch : threatend Naples with destruction , some of the same were found 200 miles distant at that time . I have sent 3 red pearls wch : are formd in a shell-fish resembling a muscle , but much larger , from wch : they take the wool from wch : gloves are made at Taranto , specimens of wch : I sent to Sarah , & begg 'd she wou 'd divide them with you . I have to beg that you will try to take the Portrait of Louisa , as you did that of my favorite P art y who has met with much admiration here ; if you cou 'd send it as a letter , perhaps it wou 'd be better preserv 'd than by the Sea ; at all events I must desire you will endeavour to give me this satisfaction . I hope to hear charming accts . of you all & that I may continue to have the consolation to find , that age or infirmities make very slow progreſs in the person of our ever reverd & beloved Father . Believe me ever yours Pray excuse my venturing to send you such ridiculous trifles wch : indeed are laughable but the time was so limited that nothing better cou 'd be musterd with my best love to my Bror : & affectte : remembrance to Mrs Morison I remain ever yours Elizth .
