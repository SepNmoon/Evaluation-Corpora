Wilton Lodge 12 th . Decr- 1791 . My Dear Sister , Was you born in Ireland ? Did You ever dip in the Shannon ? Resolve me these questions speedily , for till You do so , I must remain lost in wonderment & astoundation . Instead of that humble , penitential acknowledgement of your Negligence , due to my uncommon condescension in writing a Second Letter to You , the very first Page of your Folio Epistle contains a downright attack on Me , & an expectation of my falling on my Marrow Bones , the first time we may chance to meet . Luckily , a Snow Storm & an Empty Purse , are two strong Motives for remaining at Home , I might otherwise have been tempted , instantly to have set out , to Billingsgate You in Person . Be aſsured , it is not want of inclination , but only the above mentioned Causes & my well known Spirit of Moderation , that prevent my taking my Revenge , by transporting myself & Family to eat You out of House & Home this Christmas . Think of the punishment You have escaped , & let the terrifying Nature of it sink so deep into your Memory as to work a complete Reformation & Amendment in your manners . And beware of forcing Me , to vent any part of that Gall & Spleen on You , which , divers croſs & diabolical machinations of my Enemies , have caused to arise , and much discompose the amiable gentleneſs of my disposition . Having said so much by way of caution , I shall make a stop in my Exhortations , to allow You proper time , to reflect seriously , on the enormity of your Effrontery & Presumption -- You are pleased to refer Me to Mr. Dickenson , for an Account of the Why you did not write to Me . But be it known to You , that I entertain too high an Opinion of the Dignity & Authority of the Lord & Master of a Family , to put so groſs an Affront on a Husband , as to suppose him bound to answer for a Wife 's Lazineſs or Inattention , I therefore positively command You to make your own proper submiſsion & Apology under your own proper signature . By the bye , You was so conscious of the Arrogance of your last Letter , that you sent it away without date or name affixed to it . The first page , to be sure , has , “ Taxal Novr 1791 ” at the Top of it , & on the fourth Page appears “ Decr . 4 -- 1791 ” -- but neither of these can be esteemed legal dates . That I may not entirely drive You to Despair , I will now condescend to tell You , that whenever Mr. Dickenson will either bring or send You here , You shall be received with decent affection & treated with a tolerable share of kindneſs . The sooner you make your appearance , the more convinced I shall be of your Contrition , and really I would advise Mr. Dickenson to bring You here without loſs of time , as I begin to suspect , a little sharp Rebuke , would be good for You . We wont starve You , for be it known to You , that we now kill all our own Meat . Excellent Mutton , Admirable Highland Beef , Delicate Chinese Pork , & delicious Poultry of all kinds . What a pity it was , the Chevalier Palombi did not stray as far North as Wilton Lodge . He might , perhaps , have taken a fancy for my Sister Harriot , & so removed the probability , which now attends her , of leading Apes , ( It is fortunate , that she is not looking over my Shoulder , ) & the vexation , which his inclination for Miſs D . has given your family . of your Engaging , Charming Emma , I know nothing , except having heard , that Sir Wm . H . had married a Young , beautiful woman , of a very musical disposition , & who the illnatured world suspected , had been on a footing of intimacy with him , before their Nuptials . Not having considered the Noble K . B . as accountable to Me for any of his actions , I never enquired further , but shall receive any communication from You , on that subject , with the most profound Attention . And now , Madam , You may flatter yourself with my good wishes & those of my Rib . Love & affection to Mr. D . & the Brat . My Brats are well . The last , denominated Sophia . All this from Your Affece . Brother , till Death , Napier . Hawick Thirteenth Decr= 1791 . Mrs= Dickenson HAWICK Taxal Chapel le Frith by Derby Napier .
