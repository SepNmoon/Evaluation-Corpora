19 th . Septr.- Sunday 1779 My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend -- I am exceſsively happy to hear , that you are again perfectly well & that yr . abominable pain in yr . side has left you , & that you are again in better spirits . To be sure yr . Letter last Night , was abomi bi na bly saucy no body can deny it , I ſhd .. not have made excuses for want of time , had I had it but I have been so exceſsively hurried ever since my return from W—— yt .. I have not had a moment I cld .. call my own , my greatest pleasure is in writing to you , next to conversing with you , & that is ye . greatest pleasure , happineſs , & delight yt .. I can experience But I beseech of you yt .. whatever spirits or chearfulneſs you may enjoy Oh never , never , never hurt me as you really did last Night , by supposing me capable of discontinuing voluntarily a friendship which was , is , & ever shall be my principal object to cultivate , that is what I call trifling with my feelings , my feelings are strong as yrs . I have as strong affections as you can have , therefore I beseech once more never to throw out such doubts again , but believe me wh en at I say & tell me that you do so in yr . next . I have not begun upon ye remaining part of ye character I was too uneasy to do it , till I had wrote this short Note . Adieu dearest , dearest , dearest Friend & Sister , & believe me when I say that I shall unto my last breath be , Yr .. sincerely & ever affectionate Brother & Friend -- Palemon . toujours de même P.S . O how you love to plague me .
