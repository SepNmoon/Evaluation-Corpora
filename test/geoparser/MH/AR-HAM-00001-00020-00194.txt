38 , S t . James 's Street 5 th . March 1805 , My Dear Sister , You have much to answer for . When I ought to have been reaching the Respondents case , in an important fishing Cause , You sent me Lady Mansfield s Letter , which cost me some pains , and some time to decypher . I now restore it to You , & I think You may burn it , without doing any eſsential injustice to posterity . It is not often that You are in the right , but I must allow You to be so , when you imagine that I am comfortleſs , when separated from my family . There , I am a person of consequence , and can command , and am obeyed . Here , I have nothing to tyrannise over , and am the very picture of insignificance itself . This present week , is rather one of annoyance to me , as Wilton Lodge is to be exposed to Sale on friday . The Event , I may hear of on Monday ; but , do not expect the accounts till Tuesday . If it sells , you shall hear of it , but , I do not say when , because it will force me to write many more Letters , than I have inclination for . I am not in habits of acquaintance with the Bishop of Exeter , & therefore may not have an opportunity of delivering your Meſsage , as I never make up to Courtiers . As to Lady de Clifford , I am told that She is the intimate friend of Mrs- Fitzherbert , & consequently a very proper Governeſs for the Princeſs Charlotte . Lady Cathcart is in Ireland , and her place is filled up in the Queen s Establishment , but why , how , or by whom , I know not . The story about poor Wm . Cathcart is perfectly true . As to the number of the Cathcart Children , I can say nothing . To Mr. John D . your husband , Louisa Frances Mary Dickenson your daughter , Miſs Margaret Morrison my Countrywoman & your Lumbago 'd Self , I send my Love , Compliments & c & c & c . Ever My Dear Sister s faithful friend and Affectionate Brother Napier London , Sixth March 1805 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
