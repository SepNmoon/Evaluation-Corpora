Canterbury Decr , 20 th - 1772 I suppose and make no doubt but My dearest Mary is ſurprised at not hearing from me so long , but tho appearances are greatly against me , yet I am not afraid but she will very readily excuse me when I aſsure her , it was not want of affection for her , but want of health on my Side having been dangerous ill with a Bowel complaint which attacked me the day after I had your last letter & indeed stop 'd all my Correspondence which I now by degrees begin to open again , dont mention this when you wr o i te to Mrs Napier as I was oblig 'd to own only a little sickneſs to her However thank God I am greatly mended & ride out ev ery day again , it pleases me greatly yt . you have taken to riding as I was really uneaſy at your too sedentary Life and believe me my dearest Girl nothing hurts young people so much and I speak I am ſorry to ſay from ſad experience as nobody that I know of took so little exercise as I did till very lately tho I 'm afraid I began too late in Life to do me much good now , however the proverb says better late as never , so I am trying to get health again , by the very thing which would have preſerved it had I been wise enough to have always practised it . I have likeway another reaſon to be glad that you ride wh- is I own a selfish one ( but I know my dearest Girl will even excuse that ) Viz that I shall be happy in riding out every day with her when we are at Buxton . Apropos I have a quarrel with you , how comes it that you pay the post in yr letters to me I dont take that well from you so I beg no more of that when you have franks Good , when none pray let letters be delivered before they are paid for , as the Postage is nothing & when sent post pd- they are com̄only smugled for the money & I would much rather pay five thouſand times for yours as have one miscarry . When I was ill I ordered a Collar of Brawn to be ſent to Mrs- Hamilton & wrote the derection myself , but was not able to write you at the ſame time I hope she recd it ſafe & that it was good , but pray let me know every thing about it , as the maker ſent me word that she had taken double pains upon that very Collar as I was an old acquaintance so if it was not right , and Good , I 'll scold not a little ; Please my best Compts - t o your Mama & I hope you both will accept those of the Seaſon as I most ſincerely mean from the bottom of my heart you 'll observe that I have not anſwered one word of your last but abt , yr riding the reaſon is I keep it to anſwer when I am more able to write a long letter but believe me my dearest Mary that its not in my nature to be angry wt you my Love , Friendſhip , & regard for you is by far too great to allow me to be so was it poſsible you could give me any reaſon , but where Miſs Hamilton profeſses a friendſhip & regard I am quite ſure she never will give that friend any reaſon to ſay she does not keep up to it . So my dearest Girl write on & open yr Heart to me always ſincerely & you 'll make me happy Adieu my dearest Mary believe me ever yours most Affctly- WmNapier my next will be longer but pray write me soon -- -- Compliments of ye season to ye Kitten --
