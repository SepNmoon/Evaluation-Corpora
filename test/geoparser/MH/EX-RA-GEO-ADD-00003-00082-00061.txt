recd- Sunday Morng . 14 th . Novbr . 1779 ½ past 8 o'Clock My dearest , dearest , dearest Miranda , my Sister , my Friend , I am always sorry when I con beg in to converse with my Miranda upon trifles , however I think she will pardon me , & not look upon ym- as trifles when she knows yt . I am interested in ym- . Know then my Miranda I have learnt from ye . very best authority but it is at present a grand secret , yt . my Brother & I go to my future House , viz . Carlton House this Winter as m y Father wants our Appartments for somebody else . We are to continue still with our Governors the whole of this Winter as I believe , & yt . in ye . Spring or towards Midsummer we are both of us to dash into ye . wide World , however be persuaded My Miranda , yt . wherever I am my heart will never be absent from you , you are so imprinted in it , yt . I a ll my feelings must be obliterated before I forget you become indifferent about you , I hope we shall meet as often this Winter , as we did last . I am certain we shall meet in ye . Evening of New year 's day as it is a Gala Day & as we also met last Year , therefore I shd .. think we shd .. meet this , but we must leave every thing to Providence , we must submit chearfully to ye allwise decrees of ye . Almighty , we are conscious both of us , of a true , disinterested , virtuous , affection for each other , our hearts are irrevocably united , Oh my God I beseech thee on my knees , shower down thy almighty bleſsings upon my dearest Sister & Friend , strengthen her with thy grace , to undergo with fortitude & resignation ye . viciſsitudes of this life & at last receive her in th y in e everlasting Kingdom , testify we beseech thee almighty Father , unto us ye . continuance of thy grace upon us & may our friendship , affection , & tenderneſs be everlasting these things ever gracious Father , we intreat & beseech most earnestly of thee in ye . name of thy only Son , our bleſsed Redeemer . Such My Miranda are my constant Prayers unto my God , you who constitute ye . greatest part of my life , are ye principal subject of ym- . I hope our heavenly Father will incline his ear unto us & grant us our requests , however my dearest Friend I will no longer dwell upon this subject as I fear it will be rather too much for yr . tender spirits , therefore will only add yt . we must trust every thing unto God , & never venture to look into futurity ourselves , for yt . is only forestalling either ye . pleasures or pains he has in ſtore for us which must ever be unknown to us until they befall us . So my Miranda you are again left alone & I am again to be deprived of ye . pleasure of yr . Company , however thank heaven yt . can not last long , there will come a time when I shall be able to enjoy it at liberty , & in a manner I wish , continue to keep yr . spirits up you little idle , giddy , naughty Puſs , & be no longer low spirited , notwithstanding I admire yr . Julia so much , & every paſsage you have marked alluding to melancholy . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu ma trés chere Sœur , mon Amie , ma Miranda , soyez persuadée que rien au monde ne vous effacera du coeur de Vôtre trés affectionné Frére Palemon toujours de même P.S . Pray let me have a little Answer to this early on M——y M——g Even if but 3 lines , you shall else have a little Note , as ye greatest happineſs I enjoy is writing to you . Pray pardon my scrawl & my uncorrect style , as I am greatly hurried . Encore Ad . Ad . Ad toujours chére .
