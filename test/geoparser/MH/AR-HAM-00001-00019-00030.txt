My Dear Madam Your obligeing Letter & Your & Mrs Hamilton s kindneſs meritted an earlier acknowledgement than it has been in my power to offer Mr Napier was too much charmed wt yr Company to expect he 'd spare you a Moment to write to me bellieve me the only Letters Ive had from him were filled with nothing but about you & yr Mamma pray indulge him in yr Correspondance he wants such agreeable aſsistances to Support his Spirits in dull Country Quarters . I 'm very sorry Mrs Hamilton has been so much Indisposed but hope by this time shes much better & agree wt Mr Napier in his Prescription of Buxton . I am now to thank you in Mainie 's name & my own for yr kind present to her : which are come saffe to hand be asured she stood in need of Nothing to keep you in her Mind but will wear & prize them infinatly for your sake she would have wrote her acknowledg ements herself had she not so constant an Engagement at a french Boarding Schooll where she is a day Boarder that she has not a Moment to herself the rest of yr Cousins here join her in their most Affectionate Remembrances to you & Mrs Hamilton as to Mr Brown I went to his House & in vain Endevoured to make him give me a Letter to enclose to yr Mamma but he asured me he would do it wt out delay & send it by the Post if he does not : let me know & I 'll attackt him again -- . by a Letter received last Post from my Btr dated the 3 / 14 July I am made very Uneasy he had been very Ill of a feaver for a fortnight he then was getting gradualy better & for some days time had taken the Bark five times a day -- . & proposed if no relapse hapned to embark on board the Flora en famille the Monday fortnight after his Letter was wrote he says it was the Opinion of the Physicians that the feaver would be of use to his Constitution & that the Sea Voyage would s erve to Reastablish his Health : he bids me not wish to hear again for unleſs he was worse he would not write again till in England -- . though I hope all is well I can not help being Anxious where so much is at Stake -- Im sorry but not Surprized you find poor Miſs Litchfield so little better pray give my Love to her I heartily pity though I fear none of us can relieve her . All I did was only what Humanity required . I 'm glad she returns to Buxton the Dr told me he thought it the best chance for her Recovery to give that place a fair trial -- which as yet they had not had from reasons she can tell You -- but I fear ev'ry thing considerd her chance is but precarious . My best wishes attend Mrs Hamilton my best affection is ever Yours & I remain my Dear Miſs Hamilton s Most faithfully & c & c M A Napier
