Dear Miſs Hamilton I had the pleasure of your letter of the 31 st . of May a few days ago , & am much surprised to find that Mr. Brown 's Clerk has neglected to make you your annual Remittance . Mr Brown before he sat out for Bath , near four months ago , sent me my Rents in the usual manner with his Account , in which your Fifty Pounds are expreſsly charged to me . I will write immediately to Mr. Balfour to have this Error rectified ; if Mr. Brown 's nephew , who is his Executor , is returned to Edinburgh , the busineſs will be soon settled ; in the mean time I will desire Mr. Balfour to be punctual in sending your money . I am extremely obliged to you for your great goodneſ in mentioning me to a certain Great Person , but at the same time I am sorry you exposed yourself to the danger of giving offence ; you will do me the justice to remember that I aſsured you I meant you shou 'd always find me a safe friend , and that I shou 'd never expose you to any hazards on my account ; nothing is in these times obtain 'd but by way of barter ; I have certainly well founded pretensions , but I shall never urge them further ; as for the S_ts , they are contemptible Persons . -- I happen 'd to see Lord Dartrey paſsing my window the very day he landed ; I immediately went out to him and had a good deal of conversation with him , in which you was the principal subject , you may believe he retains the impreſsions you left him with as strong as you cou 'd wish . I am glad to hear you are upon good Terms where you mention you was certainly in a very critical situation . I am rejoiced that you have got out of it so well . Latour is now extremely beautiful , tho ' the weather is still cold & unfavourable . My Daughter Jane improves very much , she has really great abilities & sufficient steadineſs . I have removed my Son from the School where he has been for two years ; & have not yet determined where to place him ; he is a handsome Boy with very good dispositions but backward for his age , but as he is now perfectly strong & healthy I hope he will with proper management recover his lost time Mrs. Hamilton desires to be affectionately rememberd to you . I am Dr . Miſs Hamilton Your faithful & Affecte . Uncle Frederick Hamilton Latour , near Clontarf -- Dublin June 12 th . 1781
