H3 . To Lady Wake King George s advice as to Eton Windsor 17 th . August 1782 My Dearest friend The Illneſs of Prince Alfred has for some time so entirely unsettled us that I have no leisure for the pleasant occupation of writing to my friends -- but as I am apprehensive you may impute my silence to a wrong cause I will not defer writing because I can only send a few lines written in haste . this poor Child has been return 'd fm . Deal near 3 weeks he had fever , & ye . Doctor thought it proper to have him more immediately under his Care & intended when that was removed to send him back to ye . Sea-air -- We have now every reason to apprehend that he can not recover and even his Parents are prepared for the worst -- You who are a fond & tender Mother can judge what these Affectionate Parents must suffer -- You ask if Prince William 's accident was as represented in the Papers , I did not see that account , but I can tell you that he had ye . misfortune to put out his shoulder by a fall , & that it will be sometime before he can recover ye . use of his arm , as it was a month before it was set , owing to ye . part being so much swell 'd that ye . Surgeon did not find out ye . dislocation . Lady Dartrey was the Queen s guest for three day 's & invited for ye . Prince of Wales 's Birth day -- she went away last tuesday , I never saw her in better health or spirits -- I desire you will not imagine I am to be envy 'd for being under the same roof with her , for except ye . pleasure of looking at her , I have none . for I am so situated in this family , in ye . Country that I can not enjoy ye society of any one I am much disappointed that Sir Wm . is not already at Buxton -- I shall see Sr. R. Jebb to day & certainly will tell him of Sr. Wms . -- in n attention to his advice -- I am particularly sorry you delay 'd going to Buxton for Sr. R. Jebb has been there for his own health some time , he is but just return 'd from thence , you would have therefore have had ye . advantage of being able to consult him , & Sr. Wm . would have been kept in good order -- pray tell him from me that the best proof he can give you of his affection is not to triffle with his health ; surely he has not forgot his sufferings of last Winter ? & will he not to endeavour to guard against paſsing ye . next in ye . same manner ? I am extremely delighted to find you are so well satisfied with Mr. Cotten & Miſs Rowston . You did not mention any thing about my Dr . Godson -- what are your intentions with respect to him -- have you yet found a proper place to send him to , or do you intend keeping him at home ? If ye . King was to advise -- he wld . say send him to Eaton -- his M . is very partial to this school & thinks , Boys ought to go even at ye . early age of five or 6 Years old & not go to a Nurse School as he terms them , first . I recd .. a letter from Miſs King from Tunbridge in wch . she mentions Mr. Smith -- perhaps it may amuse an idle moment to know what is going forward thither -- dont shew ye . letter & return it -- I think if I get any letters yt . have matter or entertainment , I will sometimes inclose ym . -- as I can depend upon Your prudence & discretion . I wish you would sometimes treat indulge me in ye . same manner . Adieu my Dr . friend Ever Yours M Hamilton I am very well -- pray write soon , the only real pleasure I have is hearing from my friends .
