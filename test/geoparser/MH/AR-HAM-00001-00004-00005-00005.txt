You will excuse me My Dr Miſs Hamilton I am sure for not having wrote before when I tell you that I have scarce had a moment to myself since I came to Town , added to that my teizing Cough seized me as I had foretold the Night I came -- I am really concern 'd to hear your poor Mama has had such a fall but I hope by this time she is quite reestablished -- I wish it was in my power to make her mind & body easy -- we have had no letter from Mr Frederick Hamilton ( who I hear wants to give up his Living in Ireland ) & Hamilton has been so hurry 'd that he has not yet been able to see Mr Hamilton of Gate Street , but will take the very first oppertunity of doing so , & we both heartily join in wishing every thing was settled to your satisfaction -- Ly Ly Helton who has been with me this evening always enquires very kindly after Mrs Hamilton & you -- Thursday thus far My Dr Miſs Hamilton was wrote some days ago ; since which my nerves have been so much affected that I have not been able to resume my pen -- & now that I do , my stomach suffers so much that you must excuse my writing a very short letter -- Hamilton begs your acceptance of a piece of Florence Sattin with the trimming to make you a Negligé which he hopes you will wear for his Sake -- I intend sending it by the Coach on Saturday -- in a box , with a little parcel of the pepper mint drops for Mrs Hamilton I send but few of them at a time as they do not keep well -- & now I must take my leave -- Our kind love attends Mrs Hamilton & I am My Dr Miſs Hamilton Your most Affecte Aunt C Hamilton Kings Mews Thursday Janry . ye 24 th -
