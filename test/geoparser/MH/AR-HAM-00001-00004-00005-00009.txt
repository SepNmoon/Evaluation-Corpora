Tuesday Feby . 17 th - I feel myself so incapable of forgeting or wilfully neglecting My friends My Dear Miſs Hamilton that tho ' your Silence gave me pain , & that ( had I not heard from you I should probably have wrote to have reproach 'd you for it ) I never once suspected you of loving me leſs than you formerly did , I think I know your heart , & I have no little claim upon that in return for the Affection mine feels for you -- however do n't let this encourage you in your idleneſs & I must tell you that your writing constantly will be an eſsential comfort to me in this Country where Society ( what you & I call Society ) is so much wanting -- the Shocking accident we met with in the Popes Dominions has shook my nerves very much ; but thank God we have suffer 'd no lasting harm -- & our poor Swiſs ( whom you may remember ) is perfectly recover 'd except a mark of honour wch- he has in his face & which he will never lose , Sr. Wm . has settled a little Annuity upon him for his life , which has redoubled his anxiety to Serve us well , & I fancy he will never leave us -- the effects of this accident have serv 'd me for an excuse from going out in an Evening ( excepting Court balls & those days when I have been obliged to attend the Queen ) & I do aſsure you that has been no small Satisfaction to me , the Aſsemblys here are noisy , numerous , & hot & I have any no intimacy with any Italian Woman to make them tolerable to me , for if you neither play or converse at those places , it is a dreadfull punishment , to go to them a punishment which I must have gone thro ' had I gone out in order to introduce several English Ladys who are here & who have not that aversion to noise & hurry that I have -- there are some of these Ladys who appear very amiable , but my only real l comfort among them is Ly Betty Mackenzie who is one of the most valuable worthy women in the World , there is a sincerity & warmth of heart abt about her that is adorable , & a good humour & indulgence that attaches one to her in the Strongest manner , I have at different times presented Ly Betty & the rest of the English Ladys to the Queen who has receiv 'd them most graciously , shew 'd them all the Children & invited them to all the Balls at Court which are really magnificent -- when I tell you however that I have introduced all the English Ladys -- do n't imagine Ly Maynard ( whose reputation must be known to you ) has been of the number , Ld Maynard has given me a great deal of trouble & uneasiness about my not receiving her when she came to my door , & not returning her visit , & afterwards persecuted me to get her presented at Court which I could by no means consent to , upon the former part ( the not receiving her ) he desired to speak with Sr. Wm . , & then ask 'd him if he supported me in my refusal to receive Ly M 's Visits ? to which Sr Wm . answer 'd him that I had told him , “ that consistent with my situation I did not think I could act otherwise , ” & that being my fix 'd opinion he could not urge me to act contrary to it -- upon this Ld M flew in a violent paſsion & said that His Majesty should either recall his Minister or forfeit his friendship -- these were big words -- but you may believe made no impreſsion on Sr Wm . -- since this , Ld M—— has applied to Sr Wm . to present him , ( which he of course did ) but no to Ly M . j'espére qu'il n'en est plus question -- one hates to repeat refusals , & I could never answer in any other tone -- the Queen said publickly that all those I presented would ever be well receiv 'd but she knew I would take care who I presented , & that they should be only such as my own Sovereign would receive -- but I think you have had enough of this silly story -- I am out of patience that such despi c able occurrences should take up so much of that precious time which one might employ in a better manner & I am ashamed to say how much it has robb 'd me of mine & how much uneasineſs it has caused me , I hate to offend even these whom I despise , & besides that , Ld Maynard is so hot headed , that I did not like he should have any altercation with Sr Wm . Mens Quarrels terrify me . -- Your friends Mr Litchfield & Mr- ( I ca n't think of his name ) came Yesterday , they dine with us tomorrow -- we are in the midst of the hurries of the Carnival but I have been but at one ball at Court , I have a few sensible foreigners who aſsemble here every evening & converse when all the Young World ( who first meet here ) are gone to the Balls , I wish you was of the party these parties I think they are of a kind you would like -- I wish if ever you have any oppertunity that you would pay my respectfull Duty to our Gracious Queen -- I feel an honour & ( I may say ) affection for her Character that I can not describe -- the more I see of other Sovereigns the more I am confirm 'd to in this sentiment , but all this is only between you & me -- in a few days I shall write to you again -- & give you some further account of the Carnival but I would not delay writing by this Post -- My Love attends Mrs Hamilton Sr Wm . has had a vexatious accident -- the Man who was bringing a great number of Letters from the Post tumbled down & his pocket was Pick 'd of them -- we do n't know who has wrote to us -- this has just happen 'd -- Adieu My Dr . Miſs Hamilton Ever Yrs Most Affecly C H To Miſs Hamilton at Her apartment in S t James Palace London
