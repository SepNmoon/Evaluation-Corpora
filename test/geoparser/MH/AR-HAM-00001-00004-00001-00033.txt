Orchard St . No . 22 . Portman Sqe- May 4 th 1791 My dear Madam After having paſsed four months at Stanton and five at Bath we are come to Town to see our friends and partake a little of the various Amusements which this Season of the year affords in London . Our movements have I fear made us all extremely reprehensible in our neglect , I must call it , altho far from being intended , of you , altho yet Jane endeavors when we speak upon the subject to exculpate herself by observing that in your last to Mr Hamilton you acknowledged yourself in her debt , which , by the bye , has not been paid , however be that as it may we really feel the little Intercourse that has subsisted between us of late with very great regret ; and we do hope in future not to be so long without hearing of your own health Mr Dickenson s and your dear little Girl . You , no doubt , will mind for yourself your being Engaged in Building and in neceſsary Employments which I know by experience Engroſses a great deal of ones time ; So indeed does continual moving and change of situation , which is we think neither profitable nor amusing , and which in short we all agree is very tiresome , therefore that plan is to have an End , but what will be finally determined upon as yet I do not know ; but to have but one House seems to be Mr Hamilton s wish , whether that will be Bath or London I know not but shall not long be ignorant as I expect Mr Hamilton home from Stanton the End of this week , where he has been for a fortnight aſsisting in taking care of his Flock at Easter , and letting his Parsonage . This Step I know will surprise you untill I tell you in a few words that were the Emolument of the Parish as much more as it is , it woud only keep it self and defray the Expenses of moving a family twice a year , living there for five months and keeping up a Dining Neighborhood in a very thickly inhabitted Country , Entertaing Servts- and Horses , and with all , no pleasure in that sort of work to compensate . Therefore we all agreed that the family shou 'd go no more , Mr H . and his Man can go at any time and be his Curates Guest without inconvenience . If our future settlement shoud be London which seems to be Mr H . s wish I am determined to have a very very moderate House upon a Rent no purchasing for we will not break Bulk and then if any thing shoud offer for Jane that was worthy of I must say so charming so valuable a creature there will then be a pretty little sum to accompany her , but of this there is at present no prospect . She is not impatient , nor I am sure are we . When Mr Hamilton left Town he charged me to say for him to Mr Dickenson , that he hoped His Banker Mr Hammersley had been called upon to discharge the Interest due to him and that it was his intention to discharge the Principal next period : But I am confident that Mr Hamilton will not be long returned before he has the pleasure of writing either to you or Mr Dickenson more fully upon this point . All your friends here are perfectly well . Sir Wm . Hamilton is expected the 20 th . Inst . Our Son is more grown and improved than you can imagine , often enquires after you and Mr D . He is quite happy in his Military Situation and is most lucky in being already Eldest Cornet . I feel that I have scrawled a great deal and to very little purpose being so taken up with our own detail which one is too apt to fall into , but I think however to you it may be leſs uninteresting than to many others =as I flatter my self you take a kind concern in every thing that relates to us : Pray pray write soon and say you are in Charity with us . With Jane s best love I remain Yrs . R Hamilton
