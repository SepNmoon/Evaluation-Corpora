Edinburgh , 16 th - July 1805 My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 8 th . Inst- reached me three days ago , and had the weather been cooler , perhaps , I might have answered it in course of Post . But melting under a hot Sun , more like that which shines in the Torrid Zone , than what we are accustomed to in the North , I dont like the feel of my fingers sticking to the Paper as I write . ( By the bye , I use the thinnest paper in the House , in return for that you sent me ) . Since my family removed here , we have all enjoyed perfect good health , which I own was more than I expected , and which , I trust , I am thankful for . The time , for taking poſseſsion of the House , I have purchased , is not yet arrived , and we all look forward to it , with a slight degree of impatience . The present occupier must quit on the 13 th . of August , after which , a decent time must be allowed for valuing and disposing of the Furniture now in it , so that it is not likely that my Troop will be deposited in their respective Cells , till the beginning of September . The House was papered and painted within these two Years , and is clean and neat , and every body says that I have got a great Bargain of it . Having brought a good deal of furniture from the Country with me , the Drawing Room & Dining Room , are the only two , for which , new furniture will be required . In the dining Room , only Chairs will be wanted new , as I have a set of Tables . Lord Melville has been cruelly persecuted . The idea of Opposition was , that they would have been able , through him , to have disconcerted Mr. Pitt . Had not this been their object , I do not believe that they would have attacked Ld . M . As , however , they failed in their views on Mr. Pitt , they seem determined to persecute his friend to the utmost . If ever there was a Man who had leſs desire of amaſsing money than another , it is Lord Melville . I trust , he will triumph over his Enemies , in spite of all the Arts , which have been used , to render him odious to the Country . He is expected soon in this part of the Kingdom , when I shall not be among the last of his Visitors . Pitt has had a good Leſson , to warn him against hollow coalitions . If he errs again , he deserves to feel for it . As to my Interest , which you enquire after , I can only say , that no Warrant for any addition to my Salary has yet made its appearance . But , as Parliament is prorogued , the Treasury will have more leisure to expedite their busineſs , and the matter may be arranged by the October Quarter . I pity the state & condition of Louisa , and my advice to You is , to settle her comfortably as soon as poſsible , that she may not be tormented with the importunities of impertinent Suitors . When you mention Scots Music to me , You mistake my Taste . It is prohibited in my family , as I hate & detest all the miserable drawling drunts , called Scots Airs . If by accident , to oblige any barbarous Native , my daughter begins one of these Strains , off I march , and leave them to their meditations , as I shall now do You . Therefore , wi th Love & best wishes from this Garrison to You , Mr. Dickenson , Louisa & c. & c . & c . I remain ever , My Dear Sister Your Affecte- Brother Napier Had I not been three times interrupted , perhaps I might have scribbled to the bottom of this Page .
