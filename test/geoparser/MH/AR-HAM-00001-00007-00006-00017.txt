Mr. Fisher presents his Compliments to Miſs Hamilton , & encloses to her another Copy of the Milkwoman s verses , which he forgot to return with the others . Mr. F . is extremely sorry he has not had it in his power to wait upon Miſs H . this week , but she knows full well , how much the weekly trips to Windsor break in upon time : he will however certainly find leisure when he returns to London next week . Q . H . Friday Morn : Jan : 28 1785
