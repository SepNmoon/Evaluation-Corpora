Mary on tour in 1776 My dearest Clara I am quite penetrated with sorrow to hear that you are & have been so extremely Ill -- & quite hate Mrs. C . for her want of feeling -- for she aſsured me She never saw you look better -- that you was in good Spirits -- & that you had been perfectly well -- I am not a little anxious to know what occasion 'd that agitation of Spirits You hint at -- for believe me my dear friend I never can be indifferent when your happineſs is concern 'd -- -- Surely , Surely my Clara you was not in earnest when you told me you imagind my Sentiments with respect to you wld . vary with my acquaintance -- nor can I allow you to say “ my “ superiours in every “ Respect ” -- was they equal to you Clara in Sentiment we should have many Shining Characters in high Life -- of wch . there is but too great a Dearth -- I am quite astonish 'd & vextd to find you have not recd . more of my Letters -- I can account for it no other way -- that ( & Ldy .

Post office -- we imagine he put ye . Money given wth . ye . Letters in his Pocket & then destroy 'd them -- if you had directed to Dover as I desired -- ye Letters would have been safely forwarded by ye . People of ye .

Steep Hill to the Castle -- a sight worthy ye . observation -- 30 Acres of Land are inclosed within its walls -- wch . are now of no great use -- ye . walls of ye Square Tower of Julius Caesar are still rem remaining -- its preservation is of consequence to ye Curate of the Church here for he has £ 30 pr .
