Bath 1789 -- 31 July when I called upon Mrs. Rundell , this morning I found her with most of her children about her & an upper Maid -- she was reading to them a religious story & at the concluſion she read a few prayers -- She said “ I was the only man who would join with them ” -- We have had an uncommonly wet day -- the rain began soon after 8 and continued without intermiſsion till past 3 , and was succeeded by a prodigious high wind -- 1 August / I was a considerable time irresolute this morning & could not determine whether to go to pickwick or Corsham as the Clouds were lowering & threatened us with another deluge at last I decided for the former as I thought it not improbable but I might find a Letter from you at my return -- I met miſs Charlotte Isted who was riding out upon busineſs to a little village , she desired me to go on & she wd . return soon & go with me to Mr. Methuen 's -- I met Mrs . & Miſs Isted in the Street Catering -- & was pleased with my coming , as they fully expected me & had made a suitable calculation in the provision for the day -- this was lucky -- I should have spent this day very pleasantly but for an ill natured Headache , which almost prevented my looking up at the Pictures , it came on before 12 & continued till 9 , I dont recollect to have had such an one before -- there are some charming pictures indeed -- but I could not enjoy them , I was so distracted with pain -- we staid an hour and half & returned to pickwick -- one portrait I must now mention , of Mr. Methuen 's Son by Gainsborough -- which is the best picture & the strongeſt likeneſs that ever was taken of your Husband -- Miſs I . pointed it out to me & I thought it ridiculously like -- but upon a little larger scale -- I am very much pleased with Mrs. Isted -- Miſs I . who has a great deal of unpleasant bluntneſs , told me yt she thought my visit was to the pictures & yt I took them in ye way . I aſsured her that was not ye case , & to convince her that I meant to pay my respects to them I would return to them the first opporty- whilst I was there Letters came from Bristol to inform them that Mr. Lockwood & Miſs Jekyl , tired with his Father 's objections & Tardineſs had plunged , like us , into matrimony , but they have thrown themselves upon the mercy of a parent , who I am afraid has very little feeling , & tho he can not deprive his Son of a good estate , yet he may keep him on a scanty allowance , and even outlive him -- I believe there is a great deal of merit in these young people & I feel much for them -- Miſs Lockwood was married last week pretty much in the same way -- I left the Isteds at ½ past 8 & rode very hard home in hopes that the exercise might have the effect which it produced , for I was free from pain before I reached Bath -- I rode a beautiful Mare , a Hack , which had all the playful tricks of Madcap 2 / at my return last night I found a Letter & upon opening it found that it contained one too you , from Mrs. Beavoir , who desired me to forward it to you I am just returned from Church where I heard a Sermon delivered in so fine a manner & in a tone of voice so particularly affecting , that every person was charmed & I hope equally edified with me ( except my righthand Neighbor who seemed comfortably asleep ) -- the subject was the vanity of human Wishes -- after the Close which was very fine & solemn -- the Major , who was at some distance from me , Turned round to expreſs the raptures he felt , and I perceived , he was half in tears -- We both agreed that we never heard such a sermon & delivered in such a manner as to make the deepest impreſsion on our minds before -- or as a piece of Oratory , nothing equal to it -- He said that he never was so affected & entertained , & could have sat with delight for hours -- from the honesty of his heart he said “ I wish the Marquiſ of B . had heard him -- surely his heart would have been affected , & he wd . have made this worthy curate happy by bestowing a living upon so deserving a Man . ” I am happy to add that his character is not only unexceptionable but truly estimable -- after dinner I called upon the Isteds -- found Miſs Harriet at Mrs. Mary 's where I staid half an hour -- at 6 Major M . & I went for half an hour to Lady Huntindon 's Chapel -- I have read the first Volume of Mrs. Piozzi s tour -- & am astonished at the Vulgarity of the Language I made an extract out of her ode to Society in which She notices ye manners of different Countries -- & here it is -- Or if to wiser Britain led , Your vagrant Feet desire to tread with measured step and anxious care The precincts pure of Portman square While wit with elegance combined , And polished manners there you 'll find The taste correct -- and fertile mind Remember vigilance lurks near And silence with unnotic 'd sneer Who watches but to tell again Your foibles with tomorrow 's pen Till titt'ring malice smiles to see Your wonder -- grave Society -- Hester Lynch Piozzi , Observations and Reflections made in the course of a Journey through France , Italy , and Germany Vol . I . Ode to Society III . Speaking of the friendlineſs of Lizards to the human race , she says “ I have met many vipers and so few Lizards it is surprising , but they will not live in London -- Hester Lynch Piozzi , Observations and Reflections made in the course of a Journey through France , Italy , and Germany Vol . I , 20 October 1786 . She gives a pleasant Account of her travels & seems inchanted with Bath -- she frightens me with her Account of ye Muskitoes & Buggs -- they would devour me well I should like to risk my body notwithstanding the certainty of being Tormented -- 3 / You are a perverse Creature -- after writing me a scrap of figitts about me -- you have not sent me a word of consolation I would not go to Venice this morning in hopes of receiving a Letter from you & have put off my little Tour till tomorrow -- I have just been spending an hour with Mrs. Holroyd -- She told me that She wrote yesterday to Mrs. Trinet , mentioned my being here & told her that I was a very odd -- excentrick young man -- for I seemed to love my Wife as well as ever & never appeared so happy as when I was talking of her -- She told me two or three Anecdotes of Mr. Bowdler 's exceſsive Vanity and was very pleasant -- I have since called upon Mrs. Rundell She you She had any said was We have lovely fine weather these three last days -- And I aſsure my health is as well as your affectionate heart can poſsibly wish -- it is not unlikely but I may stay a week extraordinary for I hear Mrs. Garrick is coming here in a bad state of health & that Miſs More is to meet her I think it not unlikely but I may be introduced to Mr. Wilberforce , who is here -- but that is all conjecture , I expreſsed a wish , this morning to Mrs. Holroyd . & I know I am a favorite of her 's -- this Evening I shall drink Tea with Mrs. Rundell and go for an hour to Mrs. Hartley 's -- You never saw me look so clear , I have some small pritensions to a Colour & am in very good spirits , except when I think of our separation & c. & c . wch . I drive away as soon as poſsible -- for I am satisfied that an hours recollection & thought of things past & paſsing has destroyed the good effects of the waters for the preceding week -- Mrs. Isted said “ a bilious Man like you shd . never be separated from his Wife who is so dear to him -- the Waters would have been of infinitely more more service had she been with you ” This is certainly very true & hard is our Fate that we can not enjoy ourselves as we might do -- my agreeable Major is very much in a similar situation -- What horrid Accounts from Bristol -- and too many perfectly true -- the history of the world does not give information of such savage barbarities being ever committed by a Nation even in a state the most rude & uncivilized -- but for a people so enlightenined as the French & who have boasted so much of their liberality of Sentiment -- to be guilty of such premeditated cruelties is amazing -- one would suppose that hell was let loose & that the country teemed with Infernal Spirits -- These commotions will not be settled so easily I am afraid as the Patriots expect -- Mrs. Hartley has just sent me an invitation -- I know the party that is to be there , & intended to go -- She is very good to me , & longs to be acquainted with You -- Tell Mr. D—— that I shall ruin him -- Adieu My ever dear Mary -- I am most Affy & ardently Your own J.D—— Louisa must have Kiſses in abundance -- papa loves her dearly .
