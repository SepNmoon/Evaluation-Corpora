Dear Miſs Hamilton I lose no time in thanking you for your very obliging letter of the 27 th . of September , and to inform you , that you may depend upon receiving the Balance of your Account entire early in the next month ; I went to town yesterday to settle that busineſs with Mr. Huband ; I aſsure you there has been no unneceſsary delay , as the whole of your money is not yet received from the Tenants , & that from the great distreſs of the Country I have not yet received a shilling of my May Rents of my Lands in the Counties of Kildare & Meath & that I shall be under the neceſsity of ejecting several of the Tenants . You may be aſsured that I am highly sensible of the confidence you have reposed in me with regard to the purport of part of your letter , and that no improper use will ever be made of the freedom you may think fit to use in disclosing your sentiments to me upon any subject . It wou 'd be a very long and tiresome detail to inform you minutely of my expectations & disappointments from a certain quarter , all that I shall insist upon at present , is , that I am persuaded there is no man living who had better founded pretensions , resting upon the basis of royal Promises frequently repeated ; how it has happen 'd that I have derived so little good from them , I will not pretend to account for ; no impatience on my part was ever improperly expreſs 'd & when the late Ld . Warwick , many years ago had an audience of the K . on my account , he was pleased to expreſs his rembrance of me in such terms as I cou 'd have wish 'd . I was under the neceſsity of resigning the honor of being Chaplain in Ordinary , having held it a certain time , as my residence In Ireland made it extremely expensive & inconvenient to me , for I had to return to Ireland annually in the month of November . That this might not be look 'd upon as dismiſsing myself & giving up all further expectations , my Br . Sr. W. H . at my particular desire made my resignation for me , & explain 'd my motives to the K . ; this was about fifteen years ago ; to resume solicitations so long suspended , tho ' my Br . aſsured me , he mention 'd me to his M——y when he was last in England , seems to me to be an hopeleſs undertaking , especially as my ardor for worldly Things is now much abated , having nearly attain 'd the age of 51 years . It seems to have been the policy of Ministers to fill almost every department in this Country with very low men , had I by chance been a Schoolmaster or a Tutor in a great Family I might probably have been a Bishop , for of such materials is that order here principally composed ; to be descended from noble ancestors inheriting from them sentiments of honour & integrity with a respectable landed property if urged as pretensions to favors wou 'd produce nothing more than an answer of contempt . Has he Parliamentary interest what can he do for or against us ? are the questions ask 'd . It is hardly to be expected that Persons of low & mean origin who have risen to high Stations through worldly craft & servility shou 'd have adequate ideas of honour & dignity of sentiment which in the end are the best for the interests of a State . I have had frequent thoughts of making my appearance in London once more , upon the busineſs of renewing my solicitations , but have always dropp 'd them as I cou 'd never so far deceive myself as to entertain hopes of suceſs . As I have been long forgotten as well as my pretensions I shou 'd be advised , I suppose , to proceed in form , by a Memorial , which unleſs presented & back 'd by a Person of consequence , wou 'd have as little weight as the Petition of a mad Apothecary that I rember to have seen standing in the Antichamber at S t . James 's . My Dr . Miſs Hamilton it is full time to quit this unpleasing subject , tho ' I have fail 'd of advancement in my Profeſsion I ought to be thankful for the many comforts I enjoy , excellent health , admirable spirits , & a competency ; if added to these bleſsings , I enjoy the esteem of those who know me , an aſsertion which can not come properly from myself , you will not think me an unhappy being , I am sure I shou 'd be much affronted to be called so . I return the letters you enclosed -- As your royal eléves are not slow in attaining the stature of women I flatter myself with the hopes , unleſs you are honor 'd with an additional supply of them , that the time is not far distant when you will be honor 'd with some substantial mark of approbation . Mrs. Hamilton desires to be remember 'd to you I am Dear Miſs Hamilton , Your Affectionate Uncle Frederick Hamilton Latour October 6 th . 1779 .
