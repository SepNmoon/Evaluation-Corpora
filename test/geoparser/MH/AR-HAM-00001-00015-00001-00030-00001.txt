St James 's September 2 d 1788 My dear Friend ! I arrived in Town this Evening & found your dear little note , which I was happy to receive as a proof of your existence , as well as of your recollection -- the comfortable letter I promised you from Horton waited for one from you , to set out how came you never to write me even one line ? however I will say nothing more on the subject , we have nothing to reproach each other on that of our corresponding -- we are both very idle , every body complains of you my dear & Ly Wake had already chargé ed me with a long scolding meſsage to you , when fortunately for you she received your letter the day before I left Horton -- I had the pleasure of seeing her several tim es during my stay there -- & dined with her on the Tuesday before my departure -- I think her very well & in good spirits -- entre nous I do not much like Miſs Wake , Miſs Charlotte is an absolute Dwarf -- but we all like Ly Wake more & more every time we see her , Papa is absolutely in love with her -- I must now explain to you the reason of my disappeari n g so immediatly from Richmond after having intended to make some stay there & to see you -- I had proposed spending my first fortnight ( for I shall not return to Horton till the 19 th ) at the Park & my next at St Leonards -- but upon seei n g Mrs Harcourt at Court she told me she was to leave home to day , so that unleſs I went to her immediatly , I should not see her at all -- I then determined , ( having already engaged myself to Mrs Stuart ) just to go there for a day or two to see her after her very long absence & illneſs , & then to go on to St Leonards -- I did so , & left Richmond I think on Monday , I met Lady J. Penn at Church & desired her when she saw you to give my love & to tell you I was going immeddeatly & therefore could not see you till my return -- I am now just returned , after paſsing the pleasantest week I almost ever remember in my life , in that beautiful charmi n g Place ! the Owners of it I love , how ungrateful should I be to her who has been as a Mother to me , if I did not love her from my Soul ! The society I found there was the pleasantest poſsible -- all the Lennoxes -- I do not know if you are acquainted with them -- Ly Louisa is the cleverest as well as the best humoured & the most sensible Woman -- more true drollery & humour than I ever saw in any person -- the Girls are as good as beautiful & as pleasing as good -- so much simplicity , with so much sence & good humou r they are indeed everythi n g that is charmi n g & amiable & my heart was very heavy & sad when we separated yesterday -- Princeſs Elisabeth is much better , she has been very very ill again , Blisters -- all her old Complaints -- Ly Courtown is appointed , Friend to the Queen , with 500£ a year -- the Queen did it in the handsomest , most flattering manner -- & inded it is a most flattering appointment -- she asked what she was to do for this favour -- the Queen put out her hand & said , “ be my Friend ” -- So the Ducheſs of Kingston is dead -- 17000£ a year goes to Charles Mead , & know not how much to Evelyn -- & she has left all her Jewels , divided between or rather amongst , the Pope , Ly Salisbury whom she did not know , & the Empreſs of Ruſsia -- I know no further particulars of this strang will at present -- I shall be at Ly Binning s at Richmond on Saturday & at the Lodge on Monday for a week -- duri n g that time & at as early a period of it as I can , I shall call on you , the first morni n g I can poſsibly -- I go the 19 th to Horton , for a fortnight , then leave it for a Month & shall return there about the 8 th or 10 th of November for two Months -- we shall be delighted to see you any part of that time & as much of it as you can -- for my part I look to your bein g as a most comfortable & delightful Circums tance adieu my dear Friend , good night , God bleſs you remember me kindly to Mr D . I hope your dear little angel is well -- adieu once more -- To Mrs Dickenson Richmond Surry Honble . Miſs Gunning Sepr . 1788
