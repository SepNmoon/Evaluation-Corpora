24 th . Novbr . 1783 Queen 's Lower Lodge Windsor My Dear Miſs Hamilton Miſs Goldsworthy desires me to return her thanks to You , for Your obliging Note , and it gives her great pleasure to hear You are well and happy -- she at present is in one of her Old attacks on her Chest , and put on a second blister last Night , which quite disables her from writing -- but cou 'd not hear the Dutcheſs of Portland was to be here to day without giving you this inteligence . I must must now beg to say a word or two on my own account -- which is to say how much real pleasure it gives me to hear You are Well and happy , in the society of those friends -- of Kindred Merit with Your own , who know how to distinguish it in You , and cherish it for thier own , and Your sake likewise -- how very unpleasant must have been your sensations , to be under the same Roof with people You once loved ( and will always I dare say ) with so much fondneſs , and not to see them -- I own I felt for you on hearing it -- but such are the changes of this life -- I very much wish to see You . Your dear Pſs Sophia -- is taking her leſson of Music -- and looks like a little Angel , with her attentive sensible countenance -- she does not know I am writing to You -- I asked her just now if she remembered You “ O yes / indeed she said ” and coloured quite scarlet -- “ pray give my love to hammy if ever You see her again ” -- there is never any news here , You know -- but Pſs Amilia is the very sweetest creature that ever was seen -- We are to have an Air Balloon let off in the Garden this Morning at one oclock -- it is to be but a small one -- You see we are creeping in the fashion -- Adieu my dear Miſs Hamilton I wish I had any other inteligence worth communicating but you are in the center of inteligence and information , and we in the Faubourg of sameneſs , which has continued ( among other good th i ngs ) the same sentiments of aff ectio n and esteem I ever felt for you , and hope Your more brilliant and pleasurable situation , has not effaced from Your memory a person You was always kind and obliging too when here , I am with perfect Esteem My dear Miſs Hamilton s obliged Friend and humble Svt L Cheveley Lower Lodge 24 th Novr -- Miſs Hamilton at the Ducheſs of Portland s -- Bulstrode Chevelyey Cheveley
