I can not help adding a few words to night to tell you how much I was hurt 2 days ago wth . some unpleasant conversation reflections wth . regard to your dreſs , wch . was stiled coxcomical , & particularly yr . Shoes & Buckles wch . were remarkably tight & large . It grieves me that such reflections shd . always follow ye mention of your name , instead of any , upon your modesty -- sense -- greatneſs of mind & c & c. It provokes me to see you so often & repeatedly in ye . papers as a Hero of some ridiculous adventure , or silly letter frm . a Brighthelmstone Miſs -- I am quite in a Paſsion upon this Subject for I can not but be much interested in ye . establishment of your Character . I can discover thro ' ye . foibles of Youth & may I add ye . errors of too strict an education , ? -- a n good understanding , gentleneſs of manners , & what I set ye . highest value on , a feeling heart -- O may I , as you aſsure me , eternally feel ye . satisfaction of having rendered it conduc e ive to glorious purposes ! Our friendship is virtuous pure amiable may we enjoy it !
