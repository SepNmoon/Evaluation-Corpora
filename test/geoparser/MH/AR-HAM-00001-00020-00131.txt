Liverpool , 15 th . March 1795 . Far be it from me , My Dear Sister , to deny your Witchlike powers . By descent , you certainly may inherit the Gift of second sight ; and by Marriage , you may have obtained a share of such wonderful qualities as your Husband may poſseſs , in right of the Witches of Lancashire . Your very letter to Me proves your dealings with secret Intelligencers , otherwise , how could You know that I was to arrive at Liverpool on the tenth of this Month ? True , I may have written to You , that such was my Intention . But , then , all Wits are said to have mighty short Memories , and who can doubt of your being one of that number ? You ought therefore to have forgotten it . The day after I returned from placing my Son at School , the Snow begun to fall , and in such quantities that from the thirteenth of January till last week , the Roads in my neighbourhood have been totally impaſsable , T for Carriages . So that Rib & I have been close Prisoners . Happily , we are not yet so fashionable , as to be tired of one another ; our solitude consequently proved no punishment . The vile tenth of March imperceptibly drew upon Us , and the eighth , obliged us to separate . How long I am to remain here , or where to be disposed of on leaving this , is still kept secret from Me . I dread a Camp , for many reasons . I hate sleeping under Canvas , & know that the expence will ruin my Subalterns , who have nothing but their pay to live on . At present , my thoughts are principally occupied in calculating when I may probably be able to get home again . With all my ingenuity , this will not be effected earlier than October , as Major Clarkson wishes to be absent for Six Months , which he is well entitled to , having been constantly at Quarters for two Years . Should You wander into Scotland this Summer , Maria will be most happy to see You & Yours . I shall regret the impossibility of my making one of the party , and You will have an opportunity of lamenting my Absence , in Heroics . You ask me , my opinion about Invasions . I really think the French will attempt something of the sort , though my alarm , for the consequences of such an absurd proceeding , is not very great . The pretty Kettle of Fish cooked lately in Ireland , is to me , matter of more serious concern . The head , of somebody , ought to pay for it . These are not times for half measures . Either the late chief Governour , or the present Cabinet , have acted nefariously , and I sincerely hope , those who have done the wrong , will meet with severe chastisement . My sentiments , though very favourable to the Roman Catholics , are perfectly hostile to what was called their emancipation , & restoration to the bosom of their Country . They ought to be on the same footing with those of their Religion , in this Country , and on no other . Persecution for modes of Worship , I detest . But a sufficient degree of cordiality does not exist between the Irish Protestants & Catholics , & I muc h the late manœuvres will not lead t o an increase of it . Maria , Children , & Self , escaped the influenza . I trust it has by this time left Birchhall . Make my best wishes acceptable to Mr. Dickenson . Kiſs Louisa , & Miſs Morrison too , if you like . If you dont chuse to do so , pray bid Mr. D . Adieu My Dear Sister , Ever with sincere affection & regard , Your very faithful friend and Brother Napier . The Phœnix You want for a Governeſs will never be found on the banks of the Teviot -- Mrs= Dickenson Birch Hall LIVERPOOL Ld Napier 1795
