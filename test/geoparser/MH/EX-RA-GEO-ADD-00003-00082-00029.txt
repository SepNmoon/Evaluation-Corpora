29 th - August 1779 Afternoon 5 o'Clock Tell me my dearest , dearest , dearest , Friend what it is I have done ; it is a very wrong thing to condemn a Culprit without hearing him or her in their own defense . The situation of my mind can not be expreſsed , it is beyond ye power of Words , I know not , I am not conscious of having done or said any thing to merit what you said of me in yr . Letter , ye . coldneſs of ye . Style as well as ye . expreſsions of it alarmed me to ye . highest degree but when I heard ye answers you threw out to my hints you actually struck me quite dumb . For God 's sake , I entreat you by all that is dear to you , & by yr . affection to me , if you have still ye . smalle st spark remaining , inform me what it is I have said , done , or been guilty of to merit these bitter reproaches ; to say I have forfeited my word to you , is to say I have forfeited yr . good opinion , & if I have lost that , I have lost every thing that constitutes my happineſs in this World . I will patiently suffer yr . reproaches My Friend tho ' unmerited I hope , has given if I find that I have deserved them I am sure it will have been unintentionally . If you have any love or affection for me you will strongly feel my unhappineſs . Let me I again conjure you know what language it is I have held , or in what I have forfeited my Word to you . I already opened my heart totally to you , and confeſsed to you as ingenuously as was in my power all I remembered saying and all I now think I did say , be not too cruel my dearest life heel my already too much wounded heart , you know how doatingly fond I am of you , & therefore how much I must feel upon this occasion . Let me not lose ye . greatest comfort of my life , in losing such a friend as you are to whom I can impart all my little unhappineſses my little misfortunes , and private u nhappin neasin eſses . Be not too hasty in crediting ye . reports of prating idle p l e ople , who will propagate ill & bad reports merely for ye . pleasure of talking , I do not believe they do it with any other bad design , for what way it wld .. answer to them I can not understand . Be my friend , my ever loving friend , my ever tender Friend , as you have hitherto been my Sister , pardon the offences I have been guilty of if I have been guilty of any , & receive me again into that friendship which it had been ye . object of my happineſs , & in doing which I had been so happy as to succeed . Advise me in my present situation direct my conduct , for I know not what to do . I have ever since you mentioned certain reports to me this day week last , I have ever since treated ye author of them with great appearing coolneſs & civility however nothing that was outré , he has perceived it for he sent a meſsage to me to day , by yr . Meſsenger that he was afraid he had offended me some how or other for I had not spoke to him so frequently , or treated him with that kindneſs I generally do , instruct me therefore I conjure you , how you wld .. have me conduct myself to him , or what I should say to him if he asks me any any questions what he has done to merit such a conduct from me toward s . The sooner you inform me of ye . return of yr . confidence and which is ye . thing I am now most anxious about , & for which I wait with ye . utmost as well as how you wld .. have me conduct myself towards him , ye . better . Let me again intreat you to inform y m e of ye causes I have been guilty , & I repeat if I have been guilty of any receive a truly repentant heart which loves you beyond what ye confined ideas of Man can expreſs . Adieu Adieu , Adieu , my dearest dearest , dearest Friend , you ever shall be so to me . I am yr . ever constant & sincerely attached Palemon toujours de même mais changé a vôtre goût P.S . Pray inform my Meſsenger what time to call for an answer for I must have one tomorrow at ye time that is most convenient to yourself & if poſsible when that infamous woman is out . my anxiety can not be imagined . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu .
