Taxal Febry : 10 th : 1772 My Dear Miſs Hamilton may justly accuse me of neglect . I dont know how it was , but at the time when civility most demanded I shou 'd write to you , I cou 'd not do it . I had myself so lately drank of the bitter Cup of Affliction , that I was fearful of adding to yours , by writing to you ; & that my Heart wou 'd dictate to my Pen , too feellingly , for your Sensibility . I hope your good Sen s e has enabled you to resume your wonted Chearfulneſs , & agreeable employments ; & that I shall have the pleasure of hearing from you very soon . Your little Friend ( who you was so partial to ) desires her love to you . She grows fast , & is exceſsively fond of Books . much more than her Needle ; but we propose in Spring to send her to a boarding School . indeed it is high time , for she is almost ran wild . I hope Mrs : Hamilton is well . please to present my most respectful Compts : to her ; & believe me my Dr : Miſs : H—— Your sincere Friend & obliged Humble : Servt : S Dickenson
