Jan : 29 th 1786 I hasten my dear Friend to thank you for your letter which I have most impatiently and constantly expected for some time past -- I am truly happy to hear you are well , and certainly receive great pleasure from all the kind and affectionate things you say to me , but yet I am unreasonable enough not to be quite satisfied with your letter , you say nothing about yourself or Mr Dickenson I hardly understood whether he was with you or not Do you , & does he , stay at Courteenhall all the winter ? when you leave it , do you come to Town or do you go into Cheshire ? what do you do all Day ? this is not the question of a fine Town Lady , who supposes her Friend can not poſsibly find occupation to vary a dull country life , do not mistake me -- I wish to follow you thro ' the day , & know what you are about & what engages you -- do you draw or paint ? you have now leisure to apply to this amusement & to indulge your geniuses -- All you say to me my dear on the subject of my dejection is so true , just and unanswerable , that I can only reply to it by saying that it is so -- & that I can not well account for it -- I dined yesterday at Mr Selwyn 's -- he was gone out when I arrived , to fetch the D. of Queensberry , I took up a Book , it happened to be Ganganelli s letters , I opened it par un hazard at the letter -- read it -- it is an answer to a Friend who as you have done asks the cause of his dejection -- it had no ostensible one -- but he says what is true & what I feel , that we depend on so many external causes independant of us , at whose mercy we are that who can say , I have every reason to be happy , and I will be happy , or I am so -- ? Or rather I have ( in this respect certainly ) a little , weak mind , subservient to the airy , influences , & easily distracted & discomposed by every trifling circumstance -- or to speak more kindly of mysel f I have a great deal of sensibility , & if not my own , the vexations of my Friends , and certainly the misfortune & misery of my fellow creastures , alter my happineſs considerably -- The great features of my situation strike you , & speak against me -- the little , faint touches which appear only on a nearer view , paſs unnoticed -- I have not been well , I have now a bad cough , the weather has been heavy & oppreſsive , need you go further for an account of bad spirits -- I do not complain or murmur -- God knows I do n't , I am contented & resigned , nay I enjoy life , the society of my Friends , and some of the amusements of my age -- but I have moments & I suppose few people can deny having experienced them , when the mind has lost its elasticity , when the spirits have fled , & every thing disgusts & tires -- I have been drinking aſses Milk for this week past and my cough is much better -- Pſs Elisabeth is recoveri n g very fast they say -- but looks very pale and is as fat as ever -- this is very odd & I think a bad sign -- I should not be at all surprised if she was to fall into a consumption after this -- I have really at different times been quite miserable about her -- the frequent relapses have kept me in continual agitation -- Their Maj : & the two elder P . are at Windsor where they have been since Friday -- Pſs E . is in Town & goes out of airing every day . The ancient musick begins on Wednesday -- the week after , the Oratorios -- there is the old train again -- 3 Days in the week entirely given up -- I by no means like the change , from the table of my Friend 's to the re where th a nk God I have dined but 9 times since th e 14 th of November ; but I shall be obliged to go to it three times a week -- the Opera 's are begun -- they say they are to be good , but as I never go but in a Box and with a Ticket , it may be long before I have it in power to judge myself , of their merit -- I have never seen Mrs Walsing since the day I wrote to you -- she has not asked me since , which I do not regret -- she has never called upon me since she came to Town -- pray give my love to Ly Wake -- are all her children with her ? how does Miſs Wake grow up ? I have given your love to Mr Digby , who returns it -- he never had the gout before he is rather better but looks deplorably -- I am goi n g to day to dine wth Ly Langham -- dont ' you wish me joy ? adieu my dear -- ever affec : & sincerely yours MGunning -- remember me very kindly to Mr Dickenson -- How Mr Newman puts me out of patience because he is allowed to come to Horton like a tame Cat without any bodies minding him , he gives himself the airs of being my Father s Friend ! he is intimate with everybo dy Gamekeeper , Groom , farmers & servants & pries into every body 's affairs , to find matter for making himself acceptable at the next goſsiping house he goes to -- To Mrs Dickenson Courteen Hall Northamton
