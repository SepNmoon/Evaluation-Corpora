Thursday morng . St. James 's . Can not my dear Mrs. Dickenson bring me her little Louise to Day ? Any time from 2 to 4 , or perhaps 6 , I expect to be at liberty . And I hope Mr- D . will not so resent my failure of a late appointment as to refuse escorting you . Mr. Fisher has had the malice -- -- which I did not think in his nature -- to tell me the Breakfast was very charming . You will probably meet my father & Mrs Ord -- no one else , but yours , Dear Madam , F.B . Burney June 1788
