Bristol -- Wells . May 21 -- 1789 -- Dear Mrs- Dickenson , I do aſsure You your Seven obliging Packets which I recieved here would have been acknowleged more immediately by me , but then I have been waiting for some information from Mrs- Iremonger about Mrs= Walsingham to communicate to You in consequence of your particular enquiries . But tho ' dear Mrs- I—— writes to me very constantly , yet She neglects answering me in this point ; I will therefore hope She may have written to You herself , & will now confide in my own Sources of Facts & Ideas , scarce as they may be , rather than wait longer & appear ungrateful . Pray view my Paper , it is on several accounts remarkable , & of so large a size , tho ' not a Folio , that I hope You will give me some credit for undertaking it . I enclose You a Letter I recieved a few months ago from our Acquaintance Mr- Collier , & when I go to Wherwell , where I left his Sonnets , I will certainly take an opportunity of sending You one of the Copies . Pray tell me whether his “ Riddle of a serious cast , a counterpart to that on the Sigh ” is amongst those You sent me ? otherwise , I shall be glad if You will indulge me with it , together with a Solution of the french Riddles I return by this Post ; & I have not ventured to copy out those on the Sheet of Paper that contane so many , because I do not clearly know whether each of them end at the bottom of a Page & are seperate , tho ' I suspect that , on the last Page is distinct , & that it means to describe Silence . If You will correct me in these particulars , & lend me them once more , I will thank You , & shall like to add them to my Collection . the other few Manuscripts , which are all that remain from any hoards of mine , You need not trouble Yourself ever to return me ; they shall make part of the Packets of Today ; & the rest of Your 's I shall beg to delay a little longer . The Cenotaph Inscription which I enclose You appears to me strikingly pretty in it 's Mind . It is now time for me to account for the date of my Letter from these Wells , which perhaps has surprised You . I came here Six Weeks ago , with my friend Louisa Shipley , whose state of Health had been an anxiety to me all the Winter , & who was at last ordered by Sr- G—— Baker to try this air ; I believe You know her admirable & tender attachment to her Mother , & how cruel must have been the seperation under the circumstances too of weak Health & Spirits , & Mrs- Shipley neceſsarily detaned in or near Town , on Family Busineſs of a very disagreable Nature . You will not wonder I believe that the Sister You enquire after , did not become the companion here ; the habits of intimacy between Louisa & me for many Years , have been far more those of Sisters & Friends , & the office I therefore naturally felt was mine . And in it , I have had the satisfaction of seeing her recover very eſsentially , of paſsing my time with her exactly in the manner I like best , & in a beautiful country which we never saw before , & which suits both our Tastes . I have visited Mrs- Yearsley , but not yet Mrs- Chatterton . The former told me She had been lately writing 4 Tragedies , & that one , entitled Goodwin would very soon come forth on the Bristol Stage . She put on a Diffidence in some of her expressions at my first conversing with her , but I tho't I soon percieved great want of it , when She condemned all our Poets , without discrimination for not having done justice to the female Character , & that She could have represented Elfrida in better colors than Mason did . She said that Miſs More 's friends & her own , had interfered between them improperly & did mischief that could not now be rectified ; but tho ' she still spoke handsomely of Miſs Moore , yet she seemed upon the whole Self-satisfied , & not to feel the coolneſs , or betray those marks of zeal to have it made up , & understood , which would have given me a better impreſsion of her . -- I have been to see Lord De Clifford 's & Blaize Castle , the only expedition we have made ; but this , since my friend 's amendment She was very well able to enjoy ; & We are quite Enthusiasts for Prospects such as we beheld there . The Latter is in the smaller style of Elegance to which I am always partial , & which is most apt to excite my Envy , for I am often inclined to think that to be situated in the midst of beautiful Scenery , contributes a full half towards the Happineſs of Life , I am so sure of the effect it has on the Mind , of enlarging , if it does not even give ideas ; & of tranquilising the Spirits . I enjoy on one side of us here , these sublime Rocks , & on the other the fine rich contrast in Somersetshire , around the pretty Village of ashton , where I walked one Morning while Louisa Shipley rode there on a double Horse . But I will dismiſs You from a Country I believe You are well acquainted with ; & what I have said may serve to convince You I am not incapable of entering with You into all the Delights of your own , which I think abound around Taxal , if I recollect arightly what You told me , & where I would not on any account interrupt Mr. J. Dickenson 's aſsiduous Pursuits in Grove or Kitchen-garden , directed I suppose in turn to Pleasure & Utility . I know him a little , for at wherwell I could discern some traits of his Activity , & of his goodneſs of heart , whenever the Gran pa of Taxal , or your dear little Louisa were in question . I am sure You will allow me to record this , & that You will tell him so , in return for his french Songs & his Love . As I dare say He has not time at this season for singing , I shall the leſs scruple keeping the Songs till I return a few Weeks hence to Wherwell , where I left my Musick Book , into which I mean to introduce them . Neither my friend or I have an Acquaintance at this place , nor do we covet it ; It is reckoned full , but there is not a Name on the list hardly that we know . There are 3 genteel looking Girls here , Miſs Suttons the Daughters of Lord G. Manners Sutton , with Mr- & Miſs Lockwood . He is a pleasing looking Young Man , & is to marry the eldest Miſs Sutton . Miſs Meynell is marrid , & gone with Mari & Mother & a large family of Dashwoods into Switzerland . Miſs Pelham is to marry Lord Lesley , the Son of Lady Rothes . He is near 10 years Younger than Miſs P . & Lady Rothes does not much approve , but means to make the best of it . Miſs Pelham is lively , has been kept very much constraned , & will I suspect now dash a little . The youngest Miſs Hubbard is to marry Mr- Desbrough Taylor ; & two of the Lady Villiers 's to Lord Tichfield , & Lord W. Ruſsel . -- My little new Reading came out during the Winter . You probably know that Mrs- Smith 's Sonnets are come forth with their additions ; I have not seen them yet , as my edition is gone to Wherwell , since I came here . We found the Library here of so very Trumpery a sort , that we subscribe to Bulls at Bath instead , & have our Books from thence . Have You met with “ Voyages d'Anacharsis en Gréce ? ” lately come out ? & Mrs- I—— mentions in one of her letters to me that She is reading with great delight the Botanical Garden or Loves of the Plants . Dearest Mrs- I—— ( for you know how I love & respect her ) has not been this Winter in quite the comfortable health her best friends must wish her . She has appeared extremely relaxed , & complaned much of feeling so , & has given herself more up to Indolence , than with her Constitution I fear is advisable . She was blooded too for Giddineſs in the head , & has been much better since , but when such a Character is subject to such disorders , it makes one particularly solicitous . My dear Father also had very severe attacks of Cold the beginning of the Winter ; they did not start from Town so soon as usual , yet it is now some time that they have been in the Shades of Harewood . Little Catha ' has been very tolerably well ever since the Walnut Season , when she so ingeniously practised a little fineſse to taste them ; the effects soon shew 'd themselves , & to that I may say we had the comfort of attributing all the pale looks which gave You alarm ; But this is entre Nous , Vous & Moi , I only let You into the Secret , because I know how truly interested You was for her . She has had coughs in the Winter that have lasted one Day , but not longer , She has been on the whole lively & well , but grows tall & thin . shall I say I wish She had a little of your Louisa 's breadth ; pray give her a “ petit Baiser ” for me . -- And thus far have I gained upon my paper without one Word of the Royals , & tho ' it may surprise You , I can scarcely wonder at myself , I was so sick of the Subject while I was in Town . By this I do not mean to insinuate that I did not feel interested , & on what You & I should agree is the right side . But the shocking Reports & Nonsense from the other Party ; the warmth & Contradictions of each , in every Company one went into was very unpleasant , & really fatiguing . I liked the Illuminations exceſsively , & had great pleasure in driving about to see them . In some of my letters even from impartial People , it is said that the K—— is debilitated really almost to a state of Idiotism , & that He is not likely to live long . I know not what to believe , I can only tell , that from all the observations I can make , & all the inference I can draw from what I hear I shall be sorry for the fate of this Kingdom when the P . is at the head of it . there has been a great quarrel between the D. of York , & Mr- Lennox , it is said intended by the former to make him quit the Regiment . Adieu . As instead of a diſsipated life in Town , I led a very quiet one amongst particular friends it may apologise for the little News I send . Mrs- Carter seem 'd very well in the Winter , I saw her often . Your 's sincerely E. Iremonger . --
