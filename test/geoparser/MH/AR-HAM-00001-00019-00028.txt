Canterbury Jany 23 d 1773 Yours My dearest Mary came to hand two days ago but as I was from home , did not recieve it till last night if I may be allowed to make use of the expreſsion aft er saying it came to hand , and am most extremely concerned for Mrs- Hamilton s indisposition but am happy its now all over , hope she is in good health & spirits again enjoying the agreeable & senſible sally 's of my dear favorite Girl & which I know always gives her the greatest pleaſure imaginable -- you was My dear Mary employ 'd in a Godlike manner & like yr- self attending a Gentleman & friend that was in so very precarious a state of health and who ever could be offended at you for it dont deserve to be reckoned among the number of your friends , so be aſsured My Dear Girl that tho I have no greater pleasure then recieving letters from you Yet I would much rather hear of your being so char employ e d so charitably in a duty worthy of a Xtian than neglecting that duty in wr it ing to me , your last attendance on a Parent worthy of such a daughter I shall say nothing off as its quite needleſs to make Compliments to one that loves ſincerity so much as I know My dear Ward does , but believe me I hope most sincerely that by this time both Yr Patients are well , nor shall I be easy till I hear again from you abt , Your Mama 's health , so beg You 'll write by the return of the Post if only two lines to let me know how she is . Now to anſwer ſome parts of yours but remember I am writing to a Young Lady that I have the greatest Love , regard , and esteem for , and that I expect she will most profoundly keep to herself what I write her , as I would be very sorry to have known what I ch o now am going to ſay to her made public , or what I may here after write You at other times -- You ſay you have most Give Me your opinion Sincerely as thats the footing I hope we are & will always continue to act towards one & other I will not my Dr . Girl allow ye . Penseroso to pre f v ail its a bad st ile ate for a Young Lady nor do I find any Musick in it from You to M e it may do for the Kitten but I wont allow my Mary to be concerned with it & as you say my Answer will be your first pleasure I he ar re by virtue of my the Authority given Me by Your good Genius absolutely forbid , prohibit & defend that same penseroso stil e ever to visit my dear Ward Mary Hamilton again during her natural Life under no Leſs a Punishment tha t n to be Banished to westminster Abby where it ought only to reign & to w hic h place I dont design to let my Ward go too but with myself & than I think I can be answerable for her spirrits spirits not being much affected , as it should rather give us joy to see the memory of so many great persons preserved to give a just taste to Posterity to imitate their actions . Never fear that I 'll forget You , No my faithfull & Affectionate Ward , there is no danger of that , and You may believe that no Man ever had a truer F riendship for a Young Lady than that I have for You , nor do I believe any ever deserved it more . as I have many letters to write by this post You 'll excuse my not writing more at present My best Compliments to Napier & tell her she has my best prayers & Wiſhes for her perfect recovery which I hope to hear off in a few days -- If my letters gives My dearest Mrs- Hamilton ha lf the pleasure hers gives me ( & I can not doubt of it as she so of ten ſ a ys they do ) I am sure I 'll never wait long for an anſwer but I for the fu t ure beg when you can not write long ones that you 'll at least write a few lines to ease my anxiety about you Adieu My dearest & best Girl & believe me Your most faithfull & Affectionate Guardian who wishes you all Happineſs possible to be enjoyed in this World
