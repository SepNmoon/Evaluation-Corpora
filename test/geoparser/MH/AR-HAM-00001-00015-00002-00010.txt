The letters come in here but three times a week -- when you miſs two posts -- think what a long long time it seems to me , & how anxious & impatient I grow to hear of you . how mortified & disappointed to find no letter from you -- This is just wt . I feel at present -- the letters are deliver 'd -- I am well -- not quite happy for I have read a letter from D -- I fear that young Man suffers from much from an unfortunate attachment -- the Father wrote to me -- a sensible genteel , well expreſs 'd letter -- very flattering to your friend -- it throws me into a dreadful embarrassment -- I know not wt- to do -- I wd- . wish to act wth- discretion , yet Honor must be my guide I never can , or will be base enough from prudential motives alone to retract what I have once said -- Adieu July 20 th 1780 The Honble Miſs Gunning St. James 's London Free Wake
