Wilton Lodge 18 th = Janry- 1791 . My Dear Sister , The execrability of the Weather having confined me to the Library , this forenoon , & finding myself rather in a condescending humour , I have prevailed on myself to sit down to insense You , if poſsible . You will allow , there are some folks , with whom , this might be a difficult Task ; but tho ' , you have for some Years been domesticated , at a distance from the Capital , yet , you may poſsibly retain so much of your former Indigo corruption , as to flatter yourself , that your acuteneſs & penetration are fully sufficient to comprehend & unravel the Mysteries of Peerage Politics . In the first place , when You wrote to Me , you must have known , from the Newspapers , that the Committee of Privileges have not met , on the subject of our Election , but that busineſs will come on , immediately after the present Receſs , & I think may poſsibly amuse their Lordships for a couple of Years , at least . Our Adversaries object to the Votes of the Earls of Caithneſs , Moray , Rosebery , De Loraine , Visct- Dumblaine , Lords Ochiltree , Sinclair , Lindores , Napier , Fairfax , & Belhaven . We object to the Votes of the Duke of Rothsay , Earls Dysart & Caſsillis , Lords Cranstoun , Newark , Kinnaird . Besides these , we have objections to the Votes of the Marquis of Lothian & Visct . Falkland , which we have reasons for not stating , 'till we see how their Lordships in the Committee will treat the objections , of our Enemies , to the votes of the Earls of Rosebery , De Loraine , Lords Sinclair & Fairfax . The real Battle will , I think , be fought on these Votes viz . For my Friends E. Caithneſs , a good Vote Moray , Do- V. Dumblane Do- L. Ochiltree , doubtfull Lindores , good Napier , good Belhaven -- 7 good for nothing . For our Adversaries D. Rothsay -- bad E. Dysart -- wont be counted Caſsillis -- I think , will be counted L. Cranstoun , wont be counted Newark -- bad Kinnaird -- 6 wont be counted . Objections by the Enemy 1 st . The Earl of Caithneſs has presented his Claim to that Peerage to the House of Lords , who have not yet decided on it . Answer , the claim is good & will be decided to be so . 2 nd - The Earl of Moray , has no right to that Title , but is Viscount Doune only . Answer , He has a Right to that Title , & is ready to shew his Charter . 3 rd - Viscount Dumblane , ( the D. of Leeds ) was called up to the House of Lords since the Union , & therefore not entitled to Vote . Answer . He sits in the House of Lords , as D. of Leeds , created before the Union , & not as Baron Osborne created since the Union , therefore he has a right to Vote . 4 th . Lord Ochiltree has presented his Claim to that Peerage to the House of Lords , who have not yet decided on it -- N.B . I doubt whether he will be able to make out his Right , or not ? 5 th - Lord Lindores , has no right to that Title . NB . On the death of the last Lord Lindores , his Cousin the present Lord , aſsumed the Title without petitioning for it . I am told by the Lawyers that his right is good . 6 th . That the Title of Napier is Extinct . Answer , It is not Extinct , & the present Lord , has his Charter ready to produce , to show that it exists in his person . 7 th . That Lord Belhaven has no Right to that Title . To which opinion I subscribe . Objections by my Friends . 1 st . The Patent creating the first D . of Rothsay does not exist , the limitations are therefore unknown No Act of the Scots Parliament exists declaring the Prince of Scotland , Duke of Rothsay , by Birth . No Duke of Rothesay ever did sit in the Parlt of Scotland . That Title was not on the Union Roll . It has since been added , but not by an Order of the House of Lords . The Proxy given by the Prince at last Election , was defaced & informal . 2 d - The Proxy given by the Earl of Dysart was defaced & informal , besides , the Peer who held it , was did not qualif ied y to vote according to Law . 3 d . The Proxy of the Earl of Caſsillis is dated in July 1790 , & authorises the person to whom it was sent , to vote for him at the Election the 24 th - of July next . This is aſserted to mean the 24 th . July 1791 . NB . I think this a quibble , & that this vote will be sustained . 4 th . The Peer , to whom , Lord Cranstoun gave his Proxy , did not qualify to vote according to Law . 5 th = Lord Newark has no Right to that Title ; the Patent on Record , granting it , to the Heirs Male of General David Lesly , the first Lord Newark , & the present Lord , is the Descendant of a Female heir of the first Lord s . 6 th - Lord Kinnaird , did not qualify to vote , according to Law , whereby his own Vote , & those he gave as Proxy for the Earl of Dysart and Lord Cranstoun , are void . NB . This is a laughable fact . Lord Kinnaird was present at the Election , but when signing the Oaths , has actually written Kinnoul instead of Kinnaird to the Oath of Allegiance . Lord Kinnoul had signed immediately before him , & instead of subscribing his own Name , he had copied the one before it . This was not discovered , 'till we found it out , in hunting for flaws . Now , the Lists of objections will , I think , in the end , be found to stand thus ; We shall lose Ochiltree & Belhaven . Our Adversaries willl lose , Rothsay , Dysart , Cranstoun , Newark & Kinnaird . This will take off two from our Strength & five from theirs . The objections , the Enemy make to , Rosebery , De Loraine , Sinclair & Fairfax , are applicable to Lothian & Falkland , on their Side . The objection arises from a blunder of the Court of Chancery , which I am told is of no consequence . If the House of Lords should think otherwise , those votes must be struck off , on both sides , in which case we shall lose Eight Votes & they will lose only Seven . I find , on looking at my Memorandums the Enemy have objections to the Votes of Viscount Dumblane & Lord Lindores , on account of the Chancery mistake , as well as what I before stated to You . Our Lawyers say , that the Chancery blunder is of no consequence , because it can be corrected by the record at the Petty Bay Office . The Duke of Queensberry & Marquis of Abercorn claim a Right of voting , & sent Lists to the Election , which were rejected . An order of the House of Lords says , that no Peer claiming to sit in the House of Lords by a Title created since the Union , shall vote at our Elections . If they abide by their Resolution , Queensberry & Abercorn can have no Right to Vote . Abercorn , had put my name down in his List . Sir Walter Montgomery Cunninghame claimed a right , to Vote as Lord Lyle , which was rejected , the Title of Lyle not being on the Union Roll . Our Adversaries , defend this Title ; but it has been dormant for two Centuries , & tho ' he should establish his Right , yet not being on the Roll , no vote he could offer , at the last Election , can be counted . So much for the Peerage of Scotland & their Election . I wish you joy of the Chevalier Palombi 's visitation , & of the Marriage of your relation Colonel Hamilton who lived with Lord late Lord Abercorn . My Edinr . paper today announces his espousals . The Lady 's name is Ewart , a Clergyman 's daughter , & formerly Companion to my Sisters . Her brother is Envoy , at Berlin . She , once , flattered herself , with becoming my Rib . I like your House . The Water Closet , I presume , discharges itself into the Cold Bath , from thence into the Warm Bath , by which means , the Water will be sufficiently softened , & will partake much of the Quality of Thames Water , and will consequently be good for Brewing . Your Comfortable Room , is much to be envied . We have converted our Drawing Room into the Nursery , being the largest in the House . My Library into the Living Room & the late Nursery into my Library . I own , I should like to take a peep of You & should not be sorry , could You see Us . Adieu , for my fingers have got the Cramp , & I have written so much about the Lords , that all humble Ideas have been driven out of my Brains . Best affections from Rib & Self to You , Mr. Dickenson & Miſs . Ever my Dear Sister , Your Affect . Brother Napier . Hawick , Eighteenth Janry= 1791 .
