My Dear Miſs Hamilton , I am entirely of Opinion that Pſs . Eliz . had better forbear walking this Morning , & indeed the Wind is so very troublesome I have forbid the Coach for our usual Visit to Eastbourne Place . I am very well except for a triffling Head-ach proceeding I believe from my fixing having fix 'd my Eyes so long together upon Objects so high & of such a glaring White as the Cliffs you know are , but that will go off very soon & I hope to be with her Rl . Hſs . at Eleven o'Clock . till which time I wish her to read her Psalms & Chapters , get a little by heart & work , or write if she has any Letter in Contemplation for tomorrow Ever most Affly . Yrs . CFinch
