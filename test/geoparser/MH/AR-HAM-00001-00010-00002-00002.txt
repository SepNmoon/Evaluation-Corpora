Burlington Street 31 st March 1789 . Dear Sir , I am very much obliged to you for your Letter , and I should be happy to have it in my power to write often , but my busineſs retards my intentions , and after the fatigue of the day & night as I seldom leave of until ten at night I aſsure you that I find myself as much tired as a day Labourer -- I can send you no other account of Politicks than what you can learn from the newspapers . His Majesty 's recovery is certainly a most fortunate circumstance for this Country , as I really think if the Outs had once got into poſseſsion , they would not have been got out again without Force , and most likely Orange Capes would have had a serious struggle , as I have every reason to think that the Gentry would instead of Bludgeons thrust a few Bayonets into us . -- I hope as his Majesty is now well , that for the sake of his own family and his subjects , he will take care of himself -- I hear that he does not take quite so much as he ought to do . The Children are all at home at present three of them having had swelled Necks -- Katherine & Mary are almost well , but Fanny s ( Higgins says ) will be of some continuance -- Henry is very well , grows a fine fellow & is one of the best tempered Children in England -- Kath & Mary are much improved -- Fanny has not health to continue at School , but is very tractable -- I am advised to send them to Brighthelmstone the beginning of June -- Jones has certainly done Kath : much service -- I hear that your friend Lady Wake is in Town . I hope that Mrs. Dickenson has continued well all this long Winter , which I hope will now be soon over -- The Duke has completely Furnished his house at Wimbledon and intends remaining in this Country until the beginning of September -- I see him most days , and dine with him at least three days in a Week , sometimes oftener -- Sunday is my the only day that I have to myself & hitherto for these four last Sundays Nanny & Mrs. B have dined with me -- I hear that they intend being at Sunning hill this Summer -- Nanny has desired to go with the Children to the Sea -- I shall certainly be very glad to have her , but after what paſsed last summer , I shall never think of relying upon her -- It is most astonishing to think how much she gives up her life to Madneſs & folly The Westminster Petition is to come on next friday at the House of Commons , and although I have declined acting as the Agent yet I shall be under the neceſsity of giving a constant daily attendance and in the Evening at a consultation . All I wish is to have the Right of Voting established , and that we might know whether the Inhabts of Westmr only have the right ? or whether it is in those residing in Derbyshire or any other County as well as Westmr . If the house determine in favor of the latter , we shall then give ourselves no further trouble Nanny has very lately set up a blue meeting , which I hear went of very well -- I am inclinable to think that we shall have a diſsolution of Parliament in September -- I have no authority for saying so , yet every thing wears that appearance -- I shall be always very glad to see you in Town , and it will be leſs expensive for you to come up in the God permit than on Horseback Pray my best respects to Mrs. D . & believe me Dear Sir Your faithful & obed Sert .
