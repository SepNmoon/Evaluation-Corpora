23 d . Octbr 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton It is impoſsible for me to expreſs how sensibly I feel the Queen 's gracious goodneſs to me , & how very happy I shall feel tomorrow at nine o'Clock -- how I hope the Sun will shine , & how I wish the Trees were full of Leaves , & the Garden full of Flowers -- in short I wish for every thing that could make our little Cottage more worthy the Honor Her Majesty so graciously confers upon us . I beg my humble Duty -- how good of the Queen to bring the Princeſses with Her ! -- In the greatest haste Yrs : most Affly : PD I fear you have miſsed my two Letters -- about your poor Woman .
