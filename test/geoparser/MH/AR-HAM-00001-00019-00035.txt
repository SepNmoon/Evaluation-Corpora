Canterbury March 3 d 1773 I was favored with My dearest Mary 's letter dated the last day of Feby last night for wh- I most Sincerely thank her & am quite happy to find that Mrs- Hamilton & you are both well , indeed My Dear Girl Your stile shews it & I find by it that you are quite happy & free from all disagreeable thoughts & in high spirits altho your subject was rather a grave one for a young Lady of your Age , but my surprise is now at an end as you so very far excell any of them I have the honor to know & whos dispoſition is so very amiable that it must be the greatest pleasure to your friends in having a place in your friendship & the greatest comfort in the World to Mrs Hamilton in having such a Daughter to be continually with her to repay these Cares which she once took of her in her younger days & indeed its the only way left for Children to repay the many anxious moments Parents has about their Children them both when young & grown up & I am sorry to say that the older they grow , their gratatude declines greatly in but too many and some times to the horred though of wishing them gone for ever that they may the more easily gratify some favourite paſsion or other -- Your Situation in Life My dear Girl to a mind like yours is truely enviable /but how few can enjoy such a mind/ in having a Mother that knows & does indulge her daughter in every thing she deſires , being aſsured at the same time that she never does or will deſire any thing but whats reasonable there the Mother is I think full as enviable as the Daughter if not more so , as nothing can give a Parent so much joy as to find their Children what they could wish as for my Friendſhip in the most ſincere way you may always depend upon , as to instructions the Guardian must come to his amiable Ward but if she should at any time think otherwise the very best on any subject she deſires she shall always have & may command when she pleaſes -- I will not dispute with either you or Mr Fordyce whither we should turn from all Vanity 's , & Vice , or not ( I mean the obſerving of them ) but will only put you in mind that I was writing to Rev . James Fordyce , Miſs Hamilton to young Women in general which makes a great difference when a Mind is weak & eaſily carried of by a bad example then the turning from Vanity & Vice is not only right , but absolutely neceſsary , but when a Mind is properly cultivated when young by the best of educations , must not that mind be strengthened to good when it sees others unhappy by following vanity & Vice , & must not that mind still with greater energy praise God for the great advantages that good education has given them over those weak minds that goes on in the bad way . Its a doubt with me but you both agree with me , he preaches to ye weak , not the strong , and our Saviour says he came not to call the righteous , but ſinners to repentance the parable of the Fig tree is I think likeways on my ſide , but I so far agree with you both , that its better not to know vices at all , than gain knowledge by knowing it , but when one lives in this world I am afraid that it will be impoſsible at least not to see it almost every moment in ſome thing or other -- I am afraid I have lost a Correspondant in Mr Fordyce /he may not like my instructions so well/ for some time but he gave us me an opertunity , it lay in my way , & I found it as Falstaff says Hotspur did rebellion & in confidence to you , you yourself was the ſubject . I must now give over but will contrive if poſsible to add more before the post goes out to night . Juſt as I was sitting down to add a little more a Mr- Hope ( a Son of the late King s ) an old friend of mine came in from London to See me & is ſitting by me so you will I know excuse me Please my Compts- to Shakespeare & believe me to be My Dearest Mr Dunkerley most affctly Yours you shall know every thing about our change of quarters from this , after the review we go to Norwich , Bury , Ipswich & Sudbery once me My dearest Girl Adieu To Mrs- Hamilton Northamptonshire Mary Free Miſs Hamilton
