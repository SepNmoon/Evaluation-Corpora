My Friend -- you have told me you like Mr : Fitzroy -- yet you take him off -- what has Miſs Harriet Finch done more than you -- pardon this little severity . The only resentment I feel against her is that she did not let me join in the laugh against myself -- if there was any thing illnatured in the emblem of the Toad she did right not to shew me the caraccature to spare me the pain of finding out she was ungrateful ( for she must already be sensible that I know she was insincere ) I have had ye . satisfaction of being useful to her & acting a friendly part by her -- this perhaps makes her so dread fear its coming to my knowledge , & I really pity her for nothing can be more distreſsing to a mind not totally callous than such a Sensation -- She has told me that Ld . G . was a great favorite of hers ! ! Do not write to her but destroy her Note wch . I return you for that purpose . Adieu my frd . ever sincerely Yours
