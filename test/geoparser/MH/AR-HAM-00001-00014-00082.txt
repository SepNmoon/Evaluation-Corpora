Account of the Royal children pt 9 Sunday Night My Dst Friend , Actions & not words are what I judge by , & sorry am I to say by adopting that method , there are few who can stand the Test you my Dst could I have ever doubted before would have convinced me of your Affection & real Friendly anxiety by the method you took this Afternoon , it really overpowered me , & I did not dare trust myself to ask William many questions or say so much as I wished for I felt I was not equal , & I know he had your orders so strongly to examine my Countenance , that if the Tears had fallen that I felt were coming he would have reported them , & you would have imagined I was low , and indeed I am not , but I daresay you can feel that an act of tenderneſs will over power , when the reverse will rouse , that I felt strongly , & it ever will be deeply imprinted in my memory , I thank God I go on with more c our age & calmneſs then I dared flatter myself , & I trust I shall be supp orted through the whole , the Dear Angels are now asleep , th eir Spirits beyond what you can imagine , I have not a moment during the Twelve hours that they are awake to do any thing , I have attempted during but I now give it up . I begged Willm would tell you how impossible it was for me to attempt writing . I heard from the Queen you had a Cough , pray take care of yr self , why not spare yr self an hour after dinner I am sure Miſs Planta would willingly do it , & every body is not so tough as I am . I am vastly delighted with yr Journal pray continue it , for I am interested in all you do , & think of you perpetualy . The Dear Children do not forget you , P Adolphus I manage most delightfully , & we are exceedingly fond of each other , little dear Prſs Mary is more Angelic then ever , I really wish I was not so doatingly fond of her -- the play things that you intend them pray do not send till they are recovering , for then those they have must be condemned & yours will be quite a joy to them -- God Bleſs you my Dst be aſsured I am not ungrateful & be convinced that it Ever has been & Ever will be the wish of my Heart to make your life ( that part at least that I can ) as happy as the nature of this World will allow . Say what I feel to the Princeſs & to yourself that I am Your most Affte & faithful MCG --
