Ipswich July ye . 6 th . My Dear Brother , Yours of the 3 d . inst . with a Bank note inclosed for a Hundred Pounds , came safe to hand last night , for which I am much obliged to you , your usual punctually in money matters , together with a Hint from Mr. Hamilton when he was last with you to this purpose , gave me reason to expect it much about this time . I am extremely obliged to you and Mrs. Hamilton for your kind invitation to Northampton , and cou 'd I be absent from home at that time , there is no visit I cou 'd make any where that woud make me half so happy , but I must defer that satisfaction untill another opportunity . I am very much concerned to find that your old Complaint is still troublesome to you , I had flattered my self that the good airs of Northampton wou 'd have prevented in some degree the frequent returns of that disagreeable disorder . I conclude as you did not mention any thing to the Contrary that Mrs. Hamilton and my Neice are well ; you and they have my most sincere good wishes for your Healths and happine≈øs , and I beg you will believe me with great truth your most affectionate Sister and much obliged Humble Servant , R. Hamilton Betty who often talks of her good uncle , aunt and Cousin is pretty well , and desires her best Love . To The Honble . Charles Hamilton at Northampton By London Mrs Frederick Hamilton to Hon . Charles Hamilton fm Ipswich July 6 th . 1768
