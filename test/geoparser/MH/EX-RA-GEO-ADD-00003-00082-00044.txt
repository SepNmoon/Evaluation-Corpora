My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , I hope I need not expreſs to you ye . pain I felt upon parting with you , I think it was too strongly painted in my eyes , for you to mistake my feelings . A certain gloom upon yt .. account attended me thro'out ye day . We had charming Sport y——y , ( & had I been in tiptop Spirits , as I am when I know I shall see you in ye . Afternoon , & recount to my friend ye . pleasures of ye . day ) I ſhd .. have found it delightful . The circumstances of a Chace are too trivial for me to mention them to you , however there was one attending ye . Chace of y——y which I am sure will give you infinite pleasure . We first hunted one Stag , which carried us to Swindley I think they thus call Ld . Bateman 's Lodge , where we breakfasted , the Stag having escaped by leapping over a Pailing of 9 feet high as well as a broad Ditch . They then took out a second Stag Stag from ye . common Herd which they expected wld .. give us an hour 's Chace or there about , but instead of which he ran 3 hours , & then dropped thro ' wearineſs , but his life was saved & is now turned into ye . Paddock among ye . other Stags which are preparing to be chaced , by being fed as Horses are upon Oats , I shd . not have mentioned even this circumstance of our Sport , had I not thought it wld .. have given you infinite pleasure to know , yt .. ye poor Animal who had given us great delight & excellent sport had his life saved . The moment he dropped I heard it debated whether he was to live or to have his throat cut , yt . instant I vociferated sa f v e him , save him , save him , upon hearing my voice , everyone reechoed ye . same I will confeſs yt .. ye . tender heart of my lovely Miranda , pleaded strongly in his favor & obtained his life . I believe I have established my Character among ye . Gentlemen of ye . Hunt as a bold & good Horseman , by leaping over a very uggly Hedge & Ditch upon a descent , I have not according to yr . desire boasted of this to a single living Soul , I hope I shall follow yr . advice not only in this but in every thing else . Ye . continuance of yr . friendship throout ye . whole of my life is ye . greatest bleſsing I ever can hope for . As for mine , my dearest friend I hope it is as unalterable towards you , as ye . perpetual decrees of Fate . Adieu Adieu , Adieu , dearest , dearest , dearest Sister Friend , & rest aſsured , yt .. my affection for you shall never cease but with my life , I am Yr . ever sincerely affectionate Brother Palemon toujours de même . P.S . I understand we go either on Saturday or Monday to W—— to hunt on Tuesday . There are several little incidents which happened during ye . chace wh . I will tell you ye first time we meet but wh . are not of consequence enough to trouble you with now . Adieu toujours chére . P.S . Pray excuse ye . different sort of ſtyle & ye inaccuracies you will find in this Letter , as I have written it in great haste & hurry . Adieu .
