Farmborough Place September 24 th - My dear dear Friend ! I hasten to tell you how delighted I was with your dear lette r which I received on the 2 2 1 st , or rather which I found on my return to Town on that day -- I never had heard from you since May , which letter I had almost immediatly answered . I was in constant expectation of heari n g from you from that time till I last wrote but I concluded that either your situation or your avocations preven ted you writi n g , I own I have always too much confidence in the affection of my Friends , either from my own vanity , or my good opinion of them , not to suppose any reason for their silence rather than alteration , of in their sentiments towards me aſsured as I am of the continuation of yours , I shall be sati s fied that when you do not write , you can not write , but when you can , I shall always hope you will , & the more frequently you do it the happier you will make one , whose esteem , tenderneſs & sincer e attachment will last as long as you remain what she had so long the happineſs of knowing you -- I would have written , as you desired me on a folio sheet , but there is no such thing allotted me in this house -- I shall do as well tho ' or better , for you will have I believe as much here , as you gave me on your long Paper , and I will write to you again the moment I get to Horton which will be in about ten Days -- I must now account for myself since I last wrote & having brought my journal down to have this moment , will continue it both as to my Health & occupations , in my next -- I left Horton as I believe I had mentioned my intention of doing , on the 6 th of September -- I had been tormented with the pain in my jaw & toothache ever since the Races -- I held the Plate at the Hospital Church , caught cold by standing in the Door -- increased it at the Stand on the course , & again after the Ball , by hurryi n g away in compaſsion to my Father before I was cool -- I slept at Delapré & returned home next Day -- I went to the Drawingrooms of course & in the Eveni n g went down to Lord Carlisle 's , who had taken a House in Putney Lane which I daresay you know from its vicinity to Sir Henry Harpur 's -- it belonged to Ly Poeſs & now to Mr Middleton -- it is very pretty -- chearful , small , comfortable and retired -- here I remained till last Thursday -- I continued to suffer with my toothache -- Ld Car : persuaded me to go up to Spence I did , & he chose to draw my tooth -- I now expected ease -- but to my great mortification , found by a violent fit of pain just as we had left London , that the wrong tooth was drawn -- I was obliged to suffer two Days longer because the next Day was Sunday , & on Monday had the right tooth taken out -- I have since had a good deal of pain flyi n g about my face , & am far from well tho ' I do not well know what is my complaint -- I am feverish & look like a Ghost -- I take James 's Powders at night & Saline Draughts all day -- Robert James who when he chooses ( which indeed he often does ) is the most agreeable man in the world , was remarquably so all the time he remaind with us -- he carried Lord Carlisle to Eton some Days before I left Putney & is now gone to Castle Howard -- Lord Morpeth & Ly Carlisle went to Trentham on Friday , for some weeks -- I have promised Ly Caroline a visit there several years , & never yet have had it in my power , or rather never before now -- I am v astly glad to find it now in my power , for they are the best and most friendly kind people that ever existed , & have always shew me so muc h friendship , & done me so many offices of kindneſs , particularly during my illneſs at Bath , that I should be most ungrateful indeed , did I not take every opportunity of shewing my sense of their goodneſs -- I came on Saturday & I shall stay till Wednesday , when I intend goi n g to St Leonards till the next Drawingroom -- Mrs Wilmot & Lord are there -- Ly Harcourt & Del Campo -- both these last are very pleasant and agreeable People to me in their different ways -- the form er the Spanish Minister , is very pleasant and very musical -- the latter you know how much I admired in a Publick Character -- my admiration is not leſsened since I am become acquainted with her in private life & society there will be something at the Queen 's House on Friday I suppose -- Mrs Siddons Birthday -- I shall write to you about it in my next -- Pſs R . has been very indifferent again -- poor Mrs Harcourt is I fear dying at Nice -- now for my future Plans -- that I may catch you in Northamtonshire if the thing is poſsible -- I very much doubt it -- I go the 6 th -- stay till the 20 th of October return there for another fortnight in November , either the first or the last -- it is not determind , & if your intention is to be at Dallington duri n g any part of that Month , you shall determine it -- so let me know -- My Father & Miſs Danby go to Bath on the first of December for two Months & come to Town in February -- so after November there is an end of Northamtonshire till 87 -- God Grant that we may meet ! Indeed I feel our separation cruelly , but the idea of your happineſs which always occurrs when I think of you , prevents forbids me to mur mur or repine -- if you could be happy for a little while near me it would to be sure be better on many accoun ts but whilst I know you to be so , tho ' at a distance -- I must be contented -- I am sure I sincerely enter into your feeli n gs & regretts about Bell ! how well I rememb er her -- what a loſs to you ! to her Sisters ! but an irreparable one to her Children ! this has been a fatal year or rather Summer to Ladies in that situation -- Mrs Jackson what a loſs to everybody who knew her -- to the poor Lady Graham & Duke , irrecoverable ! Dſs of Montrose was dying when I was in Town -- Lady Harriet Elliott does perfectly well tho ' -- thank you my dear Friend for the Verses -- they shall be sacred -- May I say that I do not quite like them -- I find them confused & without any distinct visible meani n g -- poor Ly Ayoph has been extremely ill -- I have not seen him , on that accou nt tho ' I much wish it -- we have had some corresponden ce on account of our mutual Friend Col : Cathcart from when he brought me a letter & to whom I have already writte n 12 pages -- it would be barbarous to send leſs to India , esp when one writes but once in a year or two -- adieu my dear dear Friend -- God bleſs you -- & may every happineſs attend your steps ! your unalterable & affect : Mr Young CMG has lately been here -- she was perfectly well do you know Mrs Garrick ? She left us this mor n i n g -- a remarquable sensible Woman -- remember me to Miſs Cadogan -- To Mr D Taxal Chapel le Frith Derbyshire Mrs Dickenson Seper . 1786
