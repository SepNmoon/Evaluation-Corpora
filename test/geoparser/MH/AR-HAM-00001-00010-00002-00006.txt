Cumberland Street Novr 23 d . 1798 My dear Mrs Dickenson , I am sorry you should think that I require reminding of your goodneſs towards me , as I have a heart sufficiently grateful to remember and -- ever acknowledge the kind treatment I received during my stay in your house . My Aunt was so anxious for us all to accompany her as far as Fleet Street ( the day she left us ) which was as soon as we had breakfasted ) that I thought it would have been a strong mark of inattention in me had I remained at home , I was indeed in hopes to have returned in time to have written that evening but as we are out of Town our Post goes out -- earlier . I am quite grieved that dear Louisa -- should have suffered so much after parting with me I can aſsure her I often think of her and of the many happy hours we spent together . I am not a little thankful to her for standing my Advocate when I was not present to plead my own cause as I understand from yours , that no one else befriended me . I am quite surprised , that Mrs De Salis did not take my part but I hope ( if you will read her my excuse ) she will in future have a better opinion of me I must beg of you to give my best to Mrs Grant and also to tell her my reason for not writing sooner as I should be very sorry to lose any of her friendship , I am quite vain of Mr Huntley 's wish to take leave of me the morning I left Leighton , pray tell him I was as much disapointed as he could be M rs Mrs Bates and my Sisters agree with every one that has seen me that I am grown much taller but not fatter . Fanny and I are so nearly of the same height that it is rather a dispute whic h is the tallest Mrs B . says I am but I do n't think it I am afraid you will be more croſs on Sunday then you was to Mrs De Salis as I know how unpleasant it is to you to have that day interrupted . Pray tell Mr Dickenson that if length of letters are to compensate for my having paſsed so many agreeable months under his roof I shall never be able to write them long enough . -- Fanny is so fearful I had not thanked you for the pretty work-bag which you was so kind as to send her that she has insisted on my mentioning it again , I aſsu re you it has been introduced to all our Friends that have visited us since my return and has been much admired , F is making one like it . I suppose the occurences of the last ten days ( tho ' not of much importance ) may still be again agreeable for you to hear I shall communicate them as follows , I had so much to tell , and my sisters & my sisters to ask that I did little else the first -- three days . On Tuesday , last Week we drank Tea with Col : and Mrs Treeme in the New Road where we met Mr Warren who is a Relation of their 's Wednesday we had a long walk with Mr W . Thursday Mrs and Miſs Lowe spent the evening with us . Saturday we paid a morning visit s to Mrs Kinderley and Mrs Long . Monday Mrs Bolton and her three daughters drank tea with us . Wednesday My Aunt came to Town , dined with us and returned to Bromley with Katherine where she is to remain a week . I am not quite certain whether I thanked you for the Basket of provision you but as I have a bad memory -- My Sisters have desired me to say how much obliged to you we are for all the good things it -- contained , Fanny feasts on the walnuts , Mrs Bates does indulge poor Katherine with an onion sometimes but that is very seldom Mrs Ka had quite She has at last prevailed upon her to eat salt with her meat only . I think she is very ill used -- I have got a few patches and Mrs B has promised to collect some more amongst her Friends you may rely on my sending them as soon as I can procure them -- give my kindest love to Louisa and tell her I hope she will write me a few lines in your next letter : which I trust not I shall soon have the pleasure of receiving . Fanny unites with me in love to yourself Mr D and Louisa with Mrs Bate 's best regards I remain with every sense of gratitude Yrs ever affecy M. J. Jackson Remember me kindly to Mrs Morrison , Hannah Grant , Mrs De Salis and Mrs Bloſset -- and all enquiring Friends single To Mrs Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Bedfordshire Norman Jobs & c } 1-12:4
