Blackheath May 11 th - 1773 Yours My dearest Mary came ſafe to hand , but how very unreaſonable are you to deſire lo ng letter from me at this time when I am absolutely hurried out of my ſences with field days & other things which dont leave me time to do any thing but prepair for our reviews which are to be on the 18 th & 22 d instant the first by Major General Pitt , the last by His Majesty & I hope to get away on ye 24 th on which day or the next I hope to be in the Squ are at Northampton but I shall let you know my motions & the exact day that I 'll be with you -- It gives me great pleaſure that Cloe is already so great a favorite I dont know the Lady that ſhe belonged too otherwise I should tell her all abt . her , but since you are fond of her thats quite sufficient for my purpose & she is so good natured I make no doubt but she will take care to make friends among the Servants which will likeways show her good sense in making them her friends as a dog not liked by them always paſses but a miserable life tho the Miſstriſs be fond of it if they dislike it . You must be contented with a few lines at present & indeed till we meet as this most certainly will be the longest you will get till I see you , but you shall get longer ones from Buxton if you & Mrs- Hamilton do not go there , which I am not quite convinced off as yet as I still think it would do her good & likewise yourself as you would not live so very sedentary a Life there as you do at Northampton which must hurt your health in time tho at present not visible , this I know by experience as I owe all my illneſs 's to that way of Life ſome Years ago thank God I take rather more exercise now tho I am ſenſible not enough yet however I hope I 'll mend every day as I verrily believe its the only way to preſerve heath , exercise of the mind is I 'll allow very beneficial but the body must likeways be exercised otherwise that whimsical frame of ours would ſoon be out of order & Doctors are the dearest Petts I know off made use off by any body in this Island for which reason I hope not to be so very intimate with them as I have been for ſome years past Adieu My dearest Ward believe me yours most Affctly- -- Napier remember me in the best Manner poſsible to Mrs- Hamilton
