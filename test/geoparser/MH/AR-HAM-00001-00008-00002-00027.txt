At the Honble J : Peachey 's Newsells . Royston Deceb . 20 th - Alth ' o I can not get a Frank for this Letter -- yet as Mr Peachy leaves us tomorrow for London -- I could not resist the desire I feel to remind my dear Mrs Dickenson of her late Solitary friend . I think you will be Glad to know that alth ' o I was in a Carriage for 8 by the day till past six in the Evening . I arrived here safely that I was most cordially & kindly received by my Host . & Hosteſs . also by my dear friend Mrs Jalabert & a very pleasant Emigrant of distinction a Count Abi . I came here a miserable object . having been terrified almost to Anihilation by the Virgins & their daughter . whose disappointment of their Pleas made them so outrageous that I actually fear 'd they wd seize their Prey -- & not suffer her or me to depart . I kept the day of my departure a secret til the Sunday -- when I troubled you with a Note . Which I put into the Westminster Magazine Parcel stating on the outside that the dates are in the inside I therin begg 'd you would be so good to suffer my Letters & my Servant s Letters to be delivered at your House & that you cd be so good to forward them to me giving the direction as above -- I likewise stated that I had sent an order to them to prevent his sending any letters to Wing . but to deliver them at your House -- & that I had left orders with Baily to pay for them -- I am sure you will excuse this trouble . & grant me my Petition you are so good to me -- I can not describe to you the real pleasure . comfort , & I may add Luxury of this Place . here is a little Library furnish 'd with a Choice Collection of Books -- & some of the most Illustrious finely engraved Prints that are to be seen in any Collection & remarkably interesting . for are not very illustrious People of Antient , times . but all those of our own times & many of them in our remembrances , Buonaparté , Washington . & c & c these give in to pleasant discourse . I insist upon it . that Buonaparté is not what ought to be call 'd a great Man . because he is inconsistent . I think upon the Whole . I have the Majority on my side . Washington was certainly good & Great . Count Abi . was not only happy in meeting with a lady whose namesakes he is was so well Acquainted with in France . but with one who certainly agrees with him , that Buonaparté will in the End restore the Monarchy , he is persuaded of it , the Powers in Europe will Laſser lui faire -- he is the most agreeable French Man I ever saw in my Life for he is quiet -- he spends his time in drawing . I do n't think him a great Artist -- he last Night drew his own Chateau . at Abi . & he would describe it in English . zeres ze Bed . zere s. ze shiminé -- we were all in perspiration but we did not let him perceive it -- to tell you I always wish for your company . is I hope not strange to you . but I this morning told Mrs Peachey that I would give a great deal for your company . I have been Walking over the very pretiest kitchen Garden I ever saw in my Life -- Great part of it is surrounded by a rich Bank finely planted , & is entirely Picturesque The Plots for common garden stuff . are array 'd like Parterres & the same for Pot herbs . Sallading & c. and has all compartment . a lovely green House . well stoc 'd . & also a beautiful Grape House . Peach House . & a Hot House . in their different appartments . I there saw several curiosity , the Cotton tree Inc. the Sugar Cane . these were new to my ignorant Eyes -- tho What wd I give for dear Mrs Dickenson -- all this managed into the greatest order . & at an Expence which appears to me to be Trifling in comparison of what I sld have suppos 'd . Mrs Peachy had heard the day of my arrival here . what Mr Vernon has done for his daughters Lady Warwick has £300 per annum . his 2 other daughters the same it being the Moiety of a real Estate . he has left his other daughters a very few thousand pounds . no one knows what he had left but the Chere Amie has all the rest . it is now quite decided that Lady H——n is not to be received at Court . yr Uncle was Invited to dine at Lord Grenville s -- he was so absurd as to send to desire that he might bring his Wife -- as he found there were to be some Itallian Ladies , who she knew -- Lord G : sent word that as it was not Convenient for Sir W : to come that day -- he wd take some opportunity of sending to him when he had a Man dinner -- some people have sent excuses when they hear they are to meet her . but I am like Mr P I sd never ask these people to my House again -- Adieu my dear Mrs Dickenson . my kind Love to you all . & best wishes concludes me most truly & affecly yrs DBloſset I go to Audley End on fridy -- but not til the Post arrives here -- if you have no Letters to send me . before they may be received here -- direct to the Right Hoble Lord Braybrooke , Audley End .
