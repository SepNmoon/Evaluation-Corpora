Mrs. Iremonger has been prevented hitherto by illneſs from calling on Mrs. Dickison but as soon as it is in her power intends herself that pleasure . In the mean time if Mr . & Mrs .. Dickison would have the goodneſs to dine in Portman Square either on Saturday or Sunday next , Mr . & Mrs- Iremonger would consider themselves as much obliged to them hope the short notice will be excused on acct of their short stay in town , & also that the early hour of four O'clock will not be too inconvenient to Mr . & Mrs- Dickison as Mr. Iremonger s state of health makes early hours neceſsary .
