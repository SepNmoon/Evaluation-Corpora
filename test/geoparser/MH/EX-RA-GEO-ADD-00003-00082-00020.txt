My dearest dearest dearest Sister Friend . I set down with ye . greatest calmneſs poſsible and not with my usual impetuosity to answer both yr . last Letters . First of all I read yr . unsealed Note in which you ask me every question upon every subject , which I have attempted to answer during ye whole of our correspondance , did not I tell you how severely I should feel were I to be separa ted from you . I would not exchange ye . little conversation we have when we meet , not for any thing I know . But We might indeed correspond tho ' we were at a distance but then O Heavens I ſhould not have the happineſs of seeing my friend . You say you are sure if I allow myself time to consider but for a moment I shall perceive no reason why you should bind yourself to remain by any fresh tie , did not I tell you my dearest life , that my whole happineſs depended upon it , that it would absolutely break my heart were you to go . Excuse my impetuosity . I can not think calmly on the subject . You ask me when I am at liberty of what use yr . friendſhip will be to me then . I shall then want such a friend as you , more than at any other time , who will with freedom blame my conduct , where it deserves it , and commend it when it merits it , and I am sure you never will commend it , but when I also shall be pleased with it myself , as we agree so perfectly in Our sentiments . You will tell me that I shall need no commendation from any one else , not even from my loveliest friend , if I am pleased with my own conduct “ One ſelfapproving hour , whole Years outweighs “ Of ſtupid starers and of loud huzza 's .

You say that I shall see things in a different light hereafter than what I now do , perhaps I shall , but can you suppose that I shall ever cease being attached to a person who is & ever will be so much my Friend as yourself . You say , that you desire that my partiality for you may not make me overlook ye imprudence you have been guilty of , tho ' it is now without remedy , of accepting of my friendship , I say it is no imprudence , ye similarity of our minds , ye sympathy of our ideas , and ye . natural inclinations of our hear s ts made ye . tie ye . ſtronger . Honor , credit or satisfaction of any long duration I can not gain by establishing an intimacy or friendſhip with any person of yr . Sex , but with such a one as yourself , and I must do so in ye . opinion of everybody who knows you . My happineſs wld .. be beyond what words can expreſs were you to be ye . partner of my future days , then my joys would be endleſs , and my contentment beyond what usually falls to ye . lot of mortals . I know not how to return you my thanks for having granted my request , should you hereafter have any occasion to repent having bound yourself by such a promise to me , it wld .. be ye cause of my being miserable during ye . rest of my days . I doubt not but you have acted with the utmost generosity , as my friend , and by our mutual promises to each other , you ought to tell me how or & in what manner , and in order that as yr . friend I may at least , tho ' I can not ſhare in doing ye generous action , share in ye pleasure you receive from it . But I well know & fee f l ye person t o n whom you have conferred this generous action , 't is on myſelf . If it is not too painful to you explain to me I entreat of you how in renewing yr . prom ise to me , you have disappointed ye . expectations of others , in order that I may expreſs my gratitude to you . I am grieved that I ever should have given you an instants pain , however I am sure you can not have suffered more than I did ever since we last parted at W——
