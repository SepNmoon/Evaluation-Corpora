Kew 19 th . Septr 1782 My dear Madam I think myself very much obliged by the favor of your Letter & the elegant little Copy of verses enclosd ; they are neat and feminine ; one Stanza particularly strikes me for its simplicity & tenderneſs . I am sorry to find that a subject which I esteemd innocent , is by you considerd as of so black a nature as to sully the purity of your Paper . I however think your Judgement is hardly fair ; the materials on which it was formd , were very imperfect and ill arrangd . If I denied a Lady the bod y i ly strength of a Lion or the mental Power of a Newton , I still considerd her as endued with Qualities of equal Estimation & in her Sphere of much greater Consequence . I never presumed to warn your Sex against a Flight to Parnaſsus , altho I think you must allow that a Lady flutt'ring in the air woud be no very comely sight -- I wishd merely to detain her on Earth with a Liberty of ranging wherever she pleasd on English Ground ; & do you really then think the Limit too narrow ? I desird you to suspend your Opinion till you saw a correct Copy , which I shall now be happy to shew you : my other Verses are not yet proper for inspection , in truth they are scarcely to be calld my own since the Subject is borrowd : I am not satisfied with the imitation , such as it is however , it shall always be at your Service -- I am myself ever pleasd to know how a Friend thought at any period of time , I wishd therefore to have received some Production of Miſs H instead of Mrs Sheridan s Verses , whatever may be their merit . Mr Fisher has represented to me your Situation at Windsor ; it requires very great Steadiness of mind to be content & great Health of Body to endure the fatigue of it : If it is poſsible for any one to be content , you are , I think , that Person -- but I fear you are not sufficiently careful of your health ; dont huff me & Ill be silent on this Subject Indeed my dear Miſs Hamilton I did not Lodge Windsor
