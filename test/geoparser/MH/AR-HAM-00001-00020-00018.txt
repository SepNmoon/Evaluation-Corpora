Edinr- 5 th - May 1779 At last I have been honored with a letter from you & as I find your excuses are good , grant you a free pardon for your late supposed offences . I hardly know whether I walk upon my head or my heels , having just returned from Binning 's Marriage , where every thing & every body looked & spoke the happineſs they felt . Ly- Sophia was beautiful , affectionate , & overcome with the sincere congratulations she received and this day paſsed thro ' Edinr- in her way to Tynninghome Lord Hadinton 's Seat . I shall follow her next week -- I do n't like your nervous fevers -- are you apt to be Melancholy or Maggoty -- I wish I could have half an hour 's conversation with you , I should not fail of making you laugh at least . The Locket shall be sent to Mrs- Hunter accompany 'd by a letter from me containing the Quinteſsence of your good Wishes -- My Nonchalance is not affected I aſsure you . I have other crotchets in my brain at present . A sincere attachment , even unto Marriage occupies my thoughts . This is a secret unknown to any of my family , but I trust to your Prudence that it may remain so , at least 'till I tell you that I find myself agreable to the Fair One . She is of Noble Alliance , handsome fortune , Amiable temper , & such a person as my friends would wish me to be connected with . To be plain with you , I intend to make proposals but not for some time yet . I likewise confeſs Mrs- Hunter 's Marriage may have an effect in hastening Mine . I should be sorry to think that Dr Hs . Child should ever inherit my Titles , at the same time I sincerely wish my Sister every good that can poſsibly happen to her . Your Affair I delight in , Was Mr- Stanhope a Widower , I should have pitched upon him as your humble Admirer -- Ly- Stormont s pride will be lowered . Lord Cathcart is married in America to a Miſs Elliot aged 16 -- a Girl -- of a Scotch family -- Neice to the late Sir Gilbert Elliot -- without a sixpence & her father has Nine Children -- Ld- C—— appears to have been crazy . In himself he will find little to comfort him , having loaded his Estate with Debt of his own contracting & by his marriage perhaps entailed beggary upon his Posterity -- It is a disagreable Idea & I shall therefore drop it -- May heavenly Angels their wide wings display , And guard thy Steps in ev'ry dangerous Way , May all thy future days be blest with peace And every hour , fresh springs of Joy increase , In every state may you most happy be , And when far distant off , pray think of me Yours sincerely Napier . P.S . You see I have taken the hint about the frank -- Miſs Hamilton S t . James 's
