~—— live in a very handsome stile -- she is vulgar in her manner & appearance -- has seen little of the world , feels herself raised by her marriage with a Man of his sense , & c. but makes him an excellent wife -- is charitable & very friendly , & is so attached to me that I suppose there is nothing she would not do to serve me -- I can not however help regretting she has so little refinement -- but one must be content to suffer something out of gratitude , for the pleasures of her Husband s society .
