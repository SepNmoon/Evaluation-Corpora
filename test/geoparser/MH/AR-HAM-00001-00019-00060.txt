Going on a visit Edinburgh Feby 18 th 1774 Once more My dear Ward I have got home from a Pilgrimage round all my fifeteen friends which has lasted above a Month & as I never stayed long in one place I did n ot get yours of the 16 th - of last month till I came Home yesterday which will I hope excuse my long ſilence -- In de ed my dear Mary I am extremely ſorry that my last but one made you so uneasy , if you had known my anxiety /when I wrote it/ for you , w y ou would have pitied me If you remember the words you wrote you will at once forgive me for taking up the ſubject as I d i d , as nothing leſs could enter my Head than that you had certainly made a Marriage that you was ashamed of and conſidering my Friendship for you in what a Situation would ſuch a thing have thrown both of us , as well as your Mama & the rist of your friends & conſidering the good opinion we all have of your good ſence , prudence , & knowledge if such a thing happened you , where then could we have ever after put confidence in a Young Lady , for my part I freely tell you I never would have again trusted to the discretion of any of the Sex & should have been of opinion for the future that it was quite needleſs to give them any Education further than what nature had given them but let me drop the ſubject & pride in my own Judgement that Miſs Hamilton s conduct will always thro Life give her friends the highest opinion of her good ſense and an example to all the Young Ladies of her acquaintance We are very happy that we did not hear of your ilneſs till you was better & that the riding has entirely reestablished your health be aſsured you have no friends that wishes it more then we do , but as your time for your London jaunt is either now or drawing on I beg you 'll remember that of all the Bleſsings we enjoy in this World none is to be compared to Health but most young people like you in the Bloom of Age forgets that a very little thing to our thinking may ruin it for ever a cold is often thought nothing by the Gay but nothing is worse if not taken care off however a s I dont imagine you will run into all the diſsipation of the toun I have leſs fear of you than of any Young Lady of my acquaintance . I am glad Mrs- Hamilton is to have an agreeable Lady with her during your absence tho I dont believe it will make up for the want of her Mary s saucineſs which she knows so well how to throw in when she wants to make good her point . Believe me I am all impatience for a letter from London with all those ſenſible observations that I know you are not only capable of making but that your genius will lead you to make & I flatter myself that I will be trusted with them and that your confidence in me will be greater than it ſome times has been . -- Miſs Thursby to be married ( & your friend O Mary , Mary , that wont go down with me ) I am glad of it , its the most ſensible thing a young Lady can do , when done with propriety , as its taking a friend , a Confident , a Protector and a Husband to make those days that is allotted to her in this Life to paſs agreeably , I dont know Col. O but I hope for her sake he is a good Man , apropos to her family How does Fanchon ? Cloe , & Fairy not one word of any of them Adieu My dearest girl May God bliſs you & make you happy & believe us with great sincerity yr- best friends & remember us all to Mrs Hamilton , this is short but I want matter at present . --
