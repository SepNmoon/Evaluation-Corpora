Chelsea June 17 th : 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton I am too much obliged and honored by the Princeſses gracious Letters , not to take the first Opportunity of acknowledging them , & I beg the Scribe their Royal Highneſses employed , will present my Answer . The Princeſs Royal , will I am sure do me the Justice to believe , how very much I was mortified in not having the Honor and Happineſs of seeing the Queen at our little Cottage & If Her Majesty should condescend to come some other time , I hope Your Royal Highneſs will be of the Party , & I flatter myself my little Julia will not misbehave herself as she did when she was at Harleyford . I am very grateful to your Royal Highneſs for your gracious Expreſsions to me & my Children . Indeed nothing could be more mortifying than my not being able to pay my Duty on the King 's Birth Day , when I should have had the Honor of seeing Princeſs Augusta in the Drawing Room & I should have had great pleasure in seeing Your Royal Highneſs , & answering all Questions relating to Madlle : Paris Casaquin , & c. I have not seen her lately but I believe She is alive , & enjoying the Beautiful Woods of Sunning Hill . Your Royal Highneſs is very gracious in wishing Lord Dartrey had not parted with Fern Hill -- no One can be more sensible than I am of your Royal Highneſs es goodneſs to me on all occasions . All our Invalids are recovered & we are no longer thank God , an Hospital . I hope to be able to pay my duty , at the Drawing Room next Thursday . To Miſs Hamilton
