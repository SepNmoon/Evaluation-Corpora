My Dear Sir , After having troubled you with a second letter bearing the same date with yours which I have just now received , I shou 'd think myself inexcusable in not embracing the first opportunity to return you my best thanks for having relieved me from very great anxiety ; this I believe I express 'd pretty strongly in my last ; my mind is now in a very different state . It is true my Bankers who have some obligations to me cou 'd not well have refused me , but the application to them wou 'd have distreſs 'd me exceedingly . You may be well aſsured that I shall have every poſsible regard to your interest that you may not suffer any material inconvenience in consequence of so liberal an act of friendship . As my busineſs will be transacted with Mr. Hammersley & Mr. Greenwood with whom I believe you are acquainted , I shall feel a secret pleasure in letting them see the forward part you bear in it . I am very happy to hear that you have found benefit by sea bathing . If London is in your speculation , pray let me know , for I shall be sincerely rejoiced to see you & Mrs. Dickenson I remain My Dear Sir , Your much obliged Humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Oxford Street 249 October 5 th . 1789 .
