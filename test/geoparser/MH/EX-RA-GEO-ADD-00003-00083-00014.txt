10 th . Octbr- My friend is going again to —— for his sake I have but one reason to regret it -- at that place he contracts intimacies with people of vulgar manners -- they have no recommendation even to himself but that servility of servileyy flattering him -- & my friend has vanity -- therefore he listens with too much complacency -- why would you expose the weak side of your character to young + by forcing him to tell you what had been said in your favor -- such a question , & such information from any real , sincere , & approved friend , would have no impropriety -- let me intreat my friend that you will / except to such -- neither boast to -- nor search for compts . from . I have been made very unhappy since we met , but it is in your power to make it paſs away as the transient cloud shew me no more particular attention destroy my letters immediately if you real feel for me as a Brother for my sake destroy immediately all I write I do not doubt yr honor
