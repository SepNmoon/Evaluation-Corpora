St James 's Dec : 3 d 1785 My very dear Friend , I can not tell you how happy your long expected letter made me -- I had almost despaired of hearing from you , and was just thinking of writing to make you give some account of yourself ; for my dear I have received no such letter as you mention , or any since the end of November , which one I answered the very next day from Horton -- To hear of your Health & happineſs , always gives me unspeakable happineſs , let me have it as often as your leisure will admit of it -- I am well -- excepting an accidental Cold -- I wish I could tell you I was happy -- but you can not expect I should be so after the great loſs I have sustained -- You my dear Friend who are so well acquainted with every pli et repli of my heart will conceive what it has felt and still feels , & will give to my situation the compaſsion it deserves -- you know how I adore my Father , my Brother , how tenderly I love the Sister of my Heart , & always did , but you know not how amiable she is grown , how strengthend in every virtue , & improved in every grace , you know not that that in that Sister , I lost a sincere Friend , from whom I do not conceal a thought , & who as she enhanced every enjoyment , consoled me for every misfortune At the dreadful moment of separation , I could not however but look up to Heaven with gratitude , that she departed in tolerable Health -- excepting loſs of appetite & sleep , all her Symtoms had left her -- & I trust she will receive much benefit from change of air & a quiet life -- I have been malgré moi in very bad spirits -- for I aſsure you I have exerted myself to the utmost , nothing can exceed Ly Carlisle 's Kindneſs to me -- she came to carry me away the moment they were gone , & has never left me to myself one Day since -- I regularly drive & sup there every Day -- at least I did so till the Argylls came , to whom I now give some of my time -- they are all well , the Dſs is grown fat . Ly Louisa Stuart is come to Town too , I have spent one Evening with her -- I get up early as usual , read a good deal , & having begun to play on the harpsicord , practising musick takes up a great deal of my time -- not to speak of the constant letters to Nancy , where they are gone to spend the Winter . How shocked I was to hear of poor Ly Wake 's misfortune , whether her Friends can call it one , I doubt , but it must have been a great shock , so unexpected , so sudden -- I saw Ly Dartrey the other Day who told me she was with her , was going to Courteen Hall , where you were coming to her -- She likewise added that you had been ill , but your letter my dear Friend , wipes away every disagreeable impreſsion made by that information -- So you are going into Northamtonshire -- yes that because we are not there -- I verily believed that Sir Wm would not have died had we been at Horton -- So the fates have decreed it -- you do not mention London , my dear , do not you mean to come , or only in the Spring ? where are you to be ? Mrs Walsingham is I believe not yet come to Town , at least I have heard nothing of her , I fancy myself out of her good graces ; for she has never taken the least notice of me this Summer , or invited me to Thames Ditton -- I shall remind Bell of a promise I am sure she will with great pleas ure fulfil , that of writing to you -- I shall write to her again on Tuesday -- think of my never having yet heard from them since they left Calais , of their safe arrival there I was informed by a few lines which I received on the 17 th -- Mr Digby does not come to Town till after XmaſsChristmass , but I shall not fail to give your remembrance to him -- adieu my dear Friend , let me hear from you from Courteenhall excuse this horrid scrawl -- I have a wretched Pen & am hurried for the Post -- adieu God Almighty bleſs & preserve you -- adieu your affec : CMG—— Miſs G to To Mrs Dickenson Taxal Macclesfield Cheshire
