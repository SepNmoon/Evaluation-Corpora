London August 29 th . 1783 . My Dear Cousin I received your delightful long Letter two or three Days ago ; I am afraid you will say this short one is making but an indifferent return for it , but you will I hope , excuse it , when you know what a hurry we are all in , being to dine at our House in Bedford Square this Day . Papa explained to Sir William Hamilton the reason that prevented your coming to Town to see him . -- I am very glad the life you lead is so suited to your taste , but can not expre≈øs much joy at your resolution of not returning 'till the Winter Season ; however you will spend your time very agreeably I hope , which will make me some amends for your long absence . -- Adieu my Dear Cousin your 's sincerely Jane Hamilton
