London May ye 11 . 1765 My dear Sir , I have ye Pleaſure to forward to you a Letter from your Br . Charles Hamilton , which I hope will give you good Accts .. of him . I have been so unfortunate as only to receive one out of four which he has wrote to me . I am likewiſe aſhamed to own to you that I have mislaid a Letter I received from William for you about a week ago : it was open and I perused it , it containtnd no news but was full of thoſe Sentiments of Affection & Regard which ſhe sincerely feels for you and yours , and acquainted you that she and her Flock are in perfect Health . I hope soon to be a Witneſs of it , as I underſtand Ly . Cathcart will paſs the Regency Bill on Wednesday , and the Seſsion will probably be brought to a Period the Week after ; I shall however be long enough here to receive any Commands of your 's and the King 's , to whom and my Niece s I beg to be kindly remembered and am Dear Sir , Your moſt Affecte . Brother , Mrs. Hamilton I hope to hear you continue well : for my own part I think I have been better for some time paſt than for several years .
