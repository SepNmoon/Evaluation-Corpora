Wilton Lodge 12 th . Febry . 1802 . My Dear Sister , Your Letter of the 7 th . Inst- has given me the utmost uneasineſs , both on the Dear Louisa 's account , and that of Yourself and Mr. Dickenson . I have been too long a Father not to know , and feel , what the anxieties of Parents are , and how very impoſsible it is to write comfort . That can only be derived from trust , and confidence in the goodneſs and mercy of Almighty God . That it may be afforded to You , whatever may be the event of the Dear Louisa 's illneſs , will be my sincere Prayer . But , however alarming the Symptoms may be , I would not have You despair of the iſsue being fortunate ; for I can from experience say , that the recovery of Children , from the most dangerous and alarming complaints , is truly wonderful . I have more than once seen it , in my own Nursery , and sincerely hope You will have the same satisfaction . Most anxious shall I be , to hear again from You . When you write , direct to me , Stapleford Hall , Nottingham , as I propose leaving this for the South , on Tuesday , or Wednesday next , and expect to reach Stapleford Hall , on Saturday , the 20 th . But my motions must depend on the Weather , as my eldest Daughter accompanies me . I shall leave her , with her Aunt Lady Warren , and will call on You at NorthHampton . After a very severe Winter , and a short respite from frost , the Snow has returned again . If the weather continues as it is now , or if it should thaw , I shall be able to fulfil my intentions of leaving home , but , should there be another fall of Snow , my journey may be delayed . In that case , I will write to You again from hence . Maria desires me to aſsure You , that She enters into all your fears . Be aſsured , that none can be more attached than We both are to You , and Yours , and I well know , it is unneceſsary to say so . Give our Love to Mr. Dickenson , and the sweet Girl . God bleſs , and relieve You all from your distreſs . Ever , with sincere regard and affection My Dear Sister , Your much attached Friend & Brother Napier Hawick , Twelfth Febry- 1802 Mrs. Dickenson Post Office Northampton Napier . Lord Napier s Letters
