My dear Mrs Dickenson ! Many thanks for your kind , but melancholy letter , which has indeed distressed me very much , for tho ' I was I believe more aware of my poor Aunt 's dreadful state than you were ( not having seen her so lately as myself ) you I had not any idea she was so bad as you represent her to be , I have written three times to her since she left Ramsgate & have had no answer to any of my letters about a month ago I begged her to ask a friend of mine at Bromley to write for her what she did & at the same time told me she thought her better . knowing the misery this receiving & answering letters causes her I do not write as frequently as I otherwise shou 'd which I find she sometimes thinks unkind . I wish to God it was in my power to do any thing that cou 'd soothe & relieve her miserable situation , but I fear it is impoſsible , for as to our being often must with her , I plainly see all the objections you doe that I believe is what she most wishes & what I doubt not wou 'd be of service to her cou 'd we either of us bear it , but I aſsure if I only stay with for a few days & tho my spirits are in general good I am perfectly wretched the whole time I am with her . I am sorry Fanny said she wou 'd pay her a visit at Bath but My Aunt made such a point of it that she was fearful she might think her unkind if she were to refuse , under the present circumstances I do not see a poſsibility of her doing it she must therefore decline going in as delicate a manner as she can , Fanny 's visit to Mrs Fern having been longer deferred than she expected ( owing to Mrs FFern 's not being at liberty to receive her will of course detain her longer in Town than she expected & as Mrs FFern is far from well she may perhaps go to Cheltenham in the spring in that case Fanny will probably go with her & by that time I hope something will be settled relative to our Estate which will enable her to think of settling herself in Northampton for as that seems the plan she prefers & you are so kind as to promise to do what you can towards introducing her to some of your Friends I shou 'd be imensly sorry if any thing shou 'd occur to prevent her going there . I am now going to ask the advice of yourself & Mr D upon a subject which has long dwelt much upon my mind , you will know the kindneſs the Bishop & Mrs Horsley have ever shown me & which I can with truth say encreases every day , & therefore I shou 'd be sorry to do any thing to distreſs them but do you think I ought or ought not to leave them when Fanny settles at Northampton , much as I esteem my kind Friends you will readily believe that my own inclinations lead me to wish to live with my dear Sister but believe me if I wou 'd give up every idea of it if you & Mr D think I shou 'd be thought to be acting unkindly towards the Bp & Mrs H . It may perhaps be said by some of my Friends that I ought not to give up my Sister for them , but in Mrs Horsley ' present state of health I fear she wou 'd think me ungrateful in leaving her -- I am sure you will be very sorry to hear she has been very alarmingly these six weeks past & she still continues in a most precarious state , it is thought she never can recover this attack but I think she will for I I have seen her as ill before , you will I fear have some difficulty in decyphering this scrawl but I am writing in her room to night that the nurse may get a good nights rest , it is now past 3 o'clock the rush light burning very dim & the mice running about the room so , that I like a Fool am frightened tho ' not so much as I was used to be at the Black Rats that ran acroſs ye dining Parlor at Leighton the first year I spent with you , I know it is very absurd & I hope to cured of my absurdity in two or three nights more by getting accustomed to them , but at this moment I feel as if they were crawling over me -- I have enclosed a letter for my Aunt but have not taken any notice of having heard from you , how kind you are in wishing her to lengthen her stay with you for I am your nerves are not in a state to bear with her unfortunate uncertainties , what a comfort wou 'd it have be en to us had either of the only near relations have been in a situation that we might have enjoyed each other 's society but I fear thas is what we may never dare look forward to , God grant my poor Aunt Anna may not still be worse than she now is , but I fear we must be prepared for an event which will be far more dreadful than a final release from her sufferings . by I dr ead seeing her yet want it for indeed I have a very sincere affection for her & am fully sensible of all her amiable qualities & the great regard she has for us pray remember me most afftly to Mr D & Louisa & believe me your ever grateful & affte Goddaughter Mary J Jackson Brighton February Fourteenth 1805 Mrs Dickenson Leighton House St. Asaph Bedfordshire
