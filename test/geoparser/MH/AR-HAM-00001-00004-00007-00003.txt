My Dear Brother I yesterday kiſsed his Majesty 's hand & am now vulgarly call 'd , His Excellency but the most material part is the payt beginning . My Br . Fred : has given me his share of the family china & I was thinking that if I had a few more it wou 'd save my buying a great deal of plate for I might then do with only a first Course of Plate , & therefore if you wou 'd be so kind as to let me have what remains of yours I will send you some good China in return & when my Envoyship is at an end you shall have what remains again , if you have the least objection I beg you will not do it , but realy I beleive it will save me at least 500£ if you can conveniently to yourself do it the sooner you send them to me the better as a ship is soon going to Naples . I set out next week for Colby but shall be in London again about the 8 th of August when I hope by some means or other to see you -- Mrs H . joins in love to you & yours & I am ever My Dr . Br . most affectionately Yrs W Hamilton Mews July 14 th . 1764 to his brother Sir Wm Hamilton . July 1764
