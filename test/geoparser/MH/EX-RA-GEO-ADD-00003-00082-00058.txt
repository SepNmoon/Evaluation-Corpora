recd- Sunday Morng 7 th Novbr 1779 9 o'clock -- My dearest , dearest , dearest Sister , Friend , Miranda I saw my Mother again last Night , she behaved rather kinder to me last Night than she did ye preceeding but not as yet with her usual engaging manner , however I think my conduct towards her shd .. always be yt . of an affectionate & dutiful Child , for I do not think it is becoming a Child to a certain degree to judge of ye . behaviour of a Parent . As I have promised my Miranda to be perfectly open with her , & as it is my wish always to be so , I shall begin with telling her yt . I followed her advice in going among ye . Servants as seldom as poſsible during ye . whole of my Séjour , however I will be very honest with you . I think might even have gone leſs among ym- than I did late , wh .. however I will take care & correct for ye . future , not only because you wish it , but because I know it is for my own interest , and because it is much beneath me . I had very little communication with ye . little Liar , especially none of ye . familiar kind , however I cld .. not prevent something happening wh .. I had no sort of idea of , but wh .. I will honestly relate to you as it happened , be not too severe in yr . criticisms my William Ramus upon this occasion as I shall freely own it to you , consider only my astonishment at ye . moment , my hesitation at yte . instant what to do , what was ye . best answer to make , whether I shd .. copy yr . behaviour upon an occasion something similar , or whether I ſhd .. be silent about it , I took ye . latter part thinking that if I followed yr . example , he wld .. suppose you had informed me of yr . conduct in yt . instance . If I am wr ong my Sister , correct me & shew me where I am wrong as my tenderest & best friend as you really are . The fact then plainly is this , going to send for some Lavender Water I gave my orders to ye . little Liar , after I he had received ym—— , he asked my permiſsion to say something to me at ye other end of ye . Paſsage , I asked him what it was or what it cld .. be he had to say to me , he only reiterated his request , upon which after hav e i ng once more repeated my question I went with him , he then said he had ye . greatest favor in ye . World to ask of me , upon which I asked what it was thinking it was some request or other he had to make to which he wished me to interest myself in , he only answered me by putting a seal into my hand , & vanishing before I cld .. answer him desired me to keep it for his sake , I have behaved him to since this with more coolneſs than I did before . This my Miranda is ye . whole & sole of ye case , inform me rather than correct me . As to mentioning yr . name to him My Sister I call Heaven to witneſs yt . I do not to ye best of my recollection believe yt . even in my most unguarded moments , since you gave me my last caution I have ever mentioned yr . name to him , but most certain am I & I wld .. not say it unleſs I was perfectly so yt . since you have been at W—— I am sure I never have ; & so from far from mentioning you to him , I have purposely avoided making mention of any thing yt . might bring yt . dear name in question . Be not , I beseech you , be not for ye . future too credulous , be not too hasty in lending an ear to every liye yt . little deceitful Rascal , or yt . designing Wom a n invent . Remember oh remember , My tenderest , my dearest Friend , you caught ym—— once before in a falsehood formed about me . Pardon me , if I am very warm upon this subject , as you can not but know how much interested I am in it . I give you my word & honor , wh .. I hope you ever will find very sacred never to profane yr . name by mentioning it to yt . or any other such babbler . Never oh never doubt yr . Brother in any instance , for ye future , you ever shall find him act up to yt . Character . As to ye . reports you have had heard concerning Miranda & me , my Conduct may given some foundation for ym—— in ye . eyes of ye . attentive vulgar , but nothing wh .. wld .. have struck wellbred people as any thing particular one way or other , I never extended my Civilities to her beyond what becomes any Man to any Gentlewoman . As for M. C——l I know nothing of her . I breakfasted with her in Company with her B——r whom I know something of twice at her Father 's , you see how ye . World set Reports about , one can not speak with ye . ſmallest politeneſs to a Young Woman , but one is immediately supposed to be in love with her , nay even to have an intrigue with her . Now my dearest , dearest , dearest Friend I hope I have cleared myſelf from every imputation in yr . eyes for I am sure it is ye princip le al object of my life , to appear in ye . most amiable lights poſsible in yr . eyes , & to appear in every instance be it ever so trifling worthy of ye . name of M. H . 's Brother . I admire Ye . Man of Feeling beyond what I can expreſs , as to marking beautiful paſsages , it is out of my power for there is not one wh .. has escaped yr . delicate Pencil , what I mark with croſses as thus * is merely to call ye attention , either to Persons or things we are acquainted with . Give Yr other Brother still more insight into my Character , & tell him I esteem him for his honesty & yt . I have as honest a heart as my Miranda can wish . Ye first Part of this Letter was written before I received yrs . & I am happy yt . it was for it will more & more convince how thoroughly we coincide in all our ideas , & certain sympathy reigns thrōout all our actions . Tell me my dearest Sister , yt . you are content with my ingenuity in relating these facts to you in yr next , but how else cld .. I have fullfilled my promise . One self approving Moment whole hours surpaſs of empty starers & of loud huzzas . Pope Essay on Man , Epistle IV I send you Miranda s Seal herewith give it to yr . Maid as a token of yr . esteem for her , destroy it or do any thing upon earth with it , only if you have any love for me I beseech you never to let me see it again for I will have nothing belonging to me that can put me in mind of yt little Fool . God Bleſs you & preserve you My W—— R—— , & may you ever be happy only recollect yt I shall be unto my last Breath Yr . ever affectionate Brother Miranda toujours de même P.S . Pray let me have another Letter at my return . Adieu . toujours chére Pardon my abominable scrawl & blotting to my fear of being interrupted , encore Ad . Ad . toujours fidel .
