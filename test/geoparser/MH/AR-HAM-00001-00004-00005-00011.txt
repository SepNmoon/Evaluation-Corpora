My Dear Miſs Hamilton I can not omit taking the very first opportunity of telling you how sincerely I condole with you upon the melancholy news I receiv 'd last Post from Lady Dartrey , I regret being at too great a distance to prove more eſsentially to you the very sincere & tender affection I feel for you . I most sincerely regret poor Mrs. Hamilton , I had a real esteem & regard for her , & so ( I believe ) had every one who had so great a knowledge of her good qualities as I had , but by Lady Dartrey s account she had suffer 'd so long that her departure must have been a real release to herself , & thank God she had the comfort of seeing you in so happy a situation that it must have taken a considerable weight off her mind , & that I am sure must be a most pleasing reflection , & a balm to your tender Affectionate Heart , mine overflows with with kindneſs to you , & I embrace you with the most cordial Affection . I have thank 'd your amicable , respectable friend Ly Dartrey for her kindneſs to you , but not half as much as I would do , her friendship I look upon to be one of the most eſsential Bleſsings you poſseſs , for I fear there are not many hearts like hers . -- We have lately been witneſses to a sad scene here , I was were among the small number in the Country at the time of the Hereditary Prince of Naples Death , & had melancholy proofs that the Diadem can not shield from Shokes like these , nor from the Grief wch . must ensue the poor Queen just ready to lie in has severely felt the loſs of her favourite Child . I have been obliged to write several disagreeable letters of bus'neſs by this Post which has quite worn me out , therefore will not add more for the present than to tell you I will write you a longer letter in a Post or two , Sr Wm . is gone out shooting with The King , but he charg 'd me before he went to aſsure you of his sincere regard & Affection , & that he join 'd with me in condoling with you upon your loſs . Adieu My Dear Miſs Hamilton , be aſsured that neither distance of time or place can ever alter the true regard with wch . I am Yr Most Affectionate Aunt & faithfull friend C Hamilton Naples Janry . 5 th 1779 Sotch Shotch Scotland Scotch Scotch Sotch To Miſs Hamilton
