My Dear Miſs . Hamilton Your very obliging letter of the 6 th . of this Inst . came safe to me at my agreeable retreat near Dublin , where I have been settled since the 20 th . of May ; I have at present no house in Town , tho ' I may probably get one before the winter . I was very happy to be informed that you had freed yourself from a certain embaraſsment ; you stood upon false ground , where the danger and difficulties were entirely on your side ; such a situation was not new to me , for there happened a similar instance in my own family more than fifty years ago , which was the foundation of much perplexity and of little credit . I am really interested in your happineſs and have therefore no difficulty in offering my sentiments without reserve . As you mention 'd that Lady Stormont imagined that I had taken it amiſs in not having receiv 'd any notification of the birth of her second son , I took the opportunity of letting her know , in very civil terms what my sentiments sentiments were upon the subject , that was not the first or second instance of my having been neglected ; I perceiv 'd , that notwithstanding the little attention I was honor 'd with while I was in London I was not thought worthy of its continuance ; and that the old system was recurr 'd to ; however I did what was proper on my part , and wrote to Ld . Stormont offering my congratulations upon the occasion , who returned me a very civil answer . What their ideas or intentions may be with regard to me I can not easily conjecture ; they are I believe , as yet very undecided . If they are not themselves struck with the propriety of having some regard to the interests of a Person so nearly connected to them , they will receive little trouble from my importunities . I find myself now too old to engage in a new train of solicitations , and as my situation and pretensions are already fully understood , I shou 'd think it a meanneſs to preſs the subject upon them with any further recommendatory arguments . I can not well describe my alarms at the late frightful tumults in London , and was apprehensive that something similar might have happen 'd in Dublin , but fortunately proper precautions were opportunely interposed . I am going on improving and beautifying my little Villa , which has great merit from its charming situation , indeed hardly to be surpaſs 'd . The plantations of my own making are already so well advanced as nearly to answer their design ; the summer has hitherto been so remarkably cold that the country has been leſs agreeable than it usually is at this season . Mrs. Hamilton desires to offer her Compts . M rs . Stratford is gone to the Country but proposes to return to Town in August upon some family business that can not be put off . I have brought my Son from school to paſs a little time with us , he is now in perfect health I shall be very happy to hear from you when you have a leisure moment , Adieu Dear Miſs Hamilton believe me as I am most sincerely Your faithful & Affectt . Uncle Frederick Hamilton Latour -- Clontarf near Dublin June 25 th . 1780 . Mr. F. Hamilton June 25 : 1780 .
