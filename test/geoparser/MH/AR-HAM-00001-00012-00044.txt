Deal Castle . July 17 th . 1782 My Dear Miſs Hamilton The Difference of my Account of dear Little Prince Alfred from that I wrote Miſs Goldsworthy yesterday is rather in his favour , as he has had a better Night , & his Fever is leſs , but his unwillingneſs to walk is the same , & he has a wan , drooping , look . Mrs Cheveley has by my desire been writing an Account of him to day to Mr Hawkins , from whom she receiv 'd a Letter this Morning , expreſsing a wish that he might be drawn about in a little Chaise , as the beginger being so constantly in Arms , as he can not walk , must be bad for him . She has in consequence wrote by my desire to the Queen 's Houſe for the best of the little Chaises there to be sent down , as there is none to be had at Deal , & if we were to find any body that could make one , it would be much longer before we cd . have it , than by sending it for it from London . Mrs Cheveley thought it would be safest to write to Mrs Stainforth for it , as Elizabeth Stainforth might poſsibly be at Windsor , & so time might be lost in getting it . I long for him to be free enough of Fever , to begin the Sea bathing . I was vastly concern 'd to hear by a Letter from London yesterday of the Accident Mr Compton has had , I hope he will have had good Aſsistance at New York , where they must be in such Practice for Fractures or any Accidents of that kind ; my Account mention 'd to my great Satisfaction that no ill Consequences were apprehended from it . The Distreſs of the Asgill family I pity from my Heart & shall think poor Prince William happy if as the Papers say is likely he dies without it having come to his knowledge . We are every hour in expectation of the Ganges ( Sr Charles s Ship ) coming into the Downs , & by the end of this Week I shall have the happineſs of Mr Feilding & her family in my Neighbourhood , Lady Juliana Penn having obliged both her & Me much , by lending her Walmer Castle , Sea bathing being advised her after her same illneſs , as the most likely method to restore her Strength Adieu my dear Lord North , I long to be able to write as prosperous Accounts of my little Prince as I did at first . I beg you will present my humble Duty to Miſs Hamilton as well as to the Princes & Princeſses , & my Com̄ps to all my Friends from Yr . ever sincerely Affcte . their Majesties Charlotte Finch & Mrs Feilding beg to be remember 'd to you
