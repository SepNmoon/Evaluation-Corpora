Suffice it for me to tell you my friend , that I have given up my most favorite scheme -- I continue in a situation for wch . I have neither inclination , strength of constitution , or nor a sufficient stock of spirits to support -- I give up the society of people who are dear to me -- who are partial to me , who would treat me with the utmost tenderneſs & attention , & who were ready to receive me with affectionate hearts & open arms -- I love independence & Liberty -- I have no taste for the mere parade of life -- in short , I have already in one instance proved I was sincere in saying I would act up to the sacred character I had aſsumed -- I know yu . will not betray my confidence
