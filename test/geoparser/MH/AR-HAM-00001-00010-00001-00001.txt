Sayes Farm Sept . 2 d : Ma Chere Amie I have my dear Caterina 's promise of a few lines from you to-morrow , I shall have so great satisfaction in recieving them that I write in the mean time to thank you for your kind intention of complying with my request ; I am not without some expectation of a letter in the same cover from our Dearest Anna as I think you may have recieved one this afternoon , I have been most sincerely wishing my-self with you at the opening of it , that I might have had an ealier account of her , & enjoyed with you the greatest pleasure we could have recieved of hearing that she was well . I left you my Dear Miranda with a very sincere regret & it was doubly painful , as besides the concern I felt at parting from you I could not but be sensi-ble that losing another of the Society would make your Dear Mrs : Hamilton 's absence even more tedious ; however I hope a little time now will re-unite us all , & that we shall forget the pain we have felt in parting in the satisfaction of meeting again . I hope I have left a very good Deputy , Mary I dare say fills up some of yor leisure hours , she can not play at Cheſs , but Anna can beat you at all - Fours -- I hope they prevail on you to go out a good deal tell me whether you have given up the little excursion you talked of making with Mrs : Glover & c. to this part of the world , the weather is not inviting but the country still looks pleasant ; I do not enquire my Dear Leonidas particularly of your health I heard you were pretty well -- & I was the happier to hear it as I was not without anxiety lest we should have over fatigued you at Hampton-Court -- This retired place affords little news -- we were going this afternoon to Egham Races but prevented I do not regret it , I am not fond of that amusement & am happier to employ some part of the time which I should have spent there in conversing with you -- tell Mrs : Hamilton the Gentleman was here who painted those views in Otaheité which we saw at the Exhibition , I remember his remarking it & our surprize at the purple appearance of the Mountains & I was pleased to have it in my power to satisfy his curiosity & my own by enquiring of Leonidas who was in the Country what occasion 'd it , he tells me they are always covered with a sort of Fern which grows upon them the same kind of Fern wch : we find upon upon Heaths in England , & which also bears a purple flower , but that has a larger Flower , is fuller of Bloſsoms , & is always in Bloom . Mr : Hodges says he was much pleased with ye . appearance of the country by his account it is very beautiful & the perpetual spring they enjoy makes it usual to see the fruit at the same time upon the Tree in bloſsom , green , & ripe -- I was diverted to hear that Mr. H—— before he left England purchased a very elegant white Sattin umbrella with a broad fringe & c. which cost him 5 guineas to preserve his complexion from the Sun -- My sister will tell you that we have been obliged to give up our scheme of going into Suſsex Omiah is prevented -- could I have foreseen this I would not have left you -- as this is put off -- My Sister Mr. Paine insists upon fetching me for two or three days to Maple Durham -- I ask your leave of Absence for only that time I can not refuse a request of hers , & I will most certainly return to you next week you my depend upon my promise , if you love me well enough to be interested in it , I flatter myself you do ; -- continue to love me -- I will not decieve you Adieu Ma Chere Amie Je vous aime en verité Adieu Barnard To -- Caterina James Street Buckingham Gate
