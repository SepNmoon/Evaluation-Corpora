Monday Morning . My dear Miſs Hamilton . The contents of Your letter I am inclined to take as the effect of low Spirits and therefore wont indulge You with an f entire belief of what You have said , at least let me still indulge that thought for some time , and I beseech You not to be too much dejected about Yourself as You will find that , if poſsible more precarious pernicious to Your Health than real illneſs , but should You ( which I hope not ) continue some time hence of the same opinion I must desire You not to mention it , until I have ſu succeeded in that disagreable task of providing myself with a Proper Person , aſsuring You that at all times I shall retain a proper regard for Your Person and Merits . Charlotte To Miſs Hamilton
