Novem . 23 d 1779 Louvre , Tuesday 5 oClock Novbr . 23 d . 1779 My Dear Dear friend My Cold is not worse but I am a very poor creature & have such acute pains darting acroſs my head , particularly when I hold it down that you must be content with a very few lines from me . Your dear Note lay upon my table when I came into my Apartments at Louvre -- how welcome ! I have heard a good character of Yor . partner , indeed yt . he was uncommonly amiable , he must surely have merit , otherwise my Astrea wld- not have return 'd home in such spirits after having spent some hours in a sort of tête à tête wth . him -- I pursue this subject no farther till I hear more . tomorrow I send my ye . Hair for You to be set , -- I 've not seen my Uncle -- he did not tell me where he proposed being in Town , I must therefore wait till he enquires after me -- How You will be envied by all the esprits engroſsing so much of the Provosts attention , my Compliments to him , & tell him I invite him to meet You at my Apartments to breakfast en trio . I shall keep ye . Character Sent till Astrea You returns , I think You have shown Your Talent in depicktion , but have heighten 'd the shade much too strong -- time must undoubtedly have soften 'd the dark tints for they every part of the picture appears to me to have a certain harmony of coloring scarcely to be equall 'd . -- The Verses are very much to my taste & they have the merit of originality -- I suppose I like ym . ye . more as You are ye . subject . this is a dreadful anniversary day -- this coming to Town -- Oh think what I suffer 'd this time last Year -- I have said it , & I will perform my promise -- I will endeavour to banish gloomy ideas . I have sent to Mrs. Jackson , & hope to see her some time this Eveg . -- You know not how much I am indebted to her -- her love & affection has sav 'd me many many bitter moments . I sent for Lettice & she is to take ye . charge of sending my Packet to Mr. Fraser for to be inclosed in a frank -- I cld . procure none to day -- Adieu my Astrea my Dear Love ! I will write a few lines tomorrow for Yo . will be anxious to hear of my cold return as soon as poſsible . Miranda
