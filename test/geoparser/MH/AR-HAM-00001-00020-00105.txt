Greencroft , 27 th . August 1788 . My Dear Sister , The milk of human kindneſs is so predominant in my disposition , that it disposes Me to exercise the Christian virtue of Forgiveneſs , I therefore find no difficulty in granting Your Petition . I certainly thought th at ere was allmost time , for You to have written to Me , but as I so frequently give cause for complaining of my own Negligence , I can safely aver , I had never accused You of having altered your Sentiments of Me or Mine . Maria is , thank God , perfectly recovered . Her indisposition was entirely unexpected , at the time it happened , neither can I yet account for it . Her Aunt Lady Clavering ( who by the bye is a Fool ) prevailed on her to go to an Aſsize Ball at Newcastle , before it was entirely prudent for her to have done so . I do not like to appear Croſs , & therefore tacitly consented . The consequence was exactly what I expected , She was confined a second time . I blamed the Ball , & Ly . Clavering was convinced she was not I hope she is now sufficiently strong , and that I shall have nothing to regret but the loſs of my Second Son . I had no idea of your intention of remaining in the South so long . When you last wrote to Me , you talked only of a Spring Visit . I dare say Mr. Jackson & Miſs A. Clarke are tired of You long ago . You and your Brat must be too much good company at one time . Fortunately Mr. Dickenson is of the Party ; if he had not been with You and I am confident you would have been turned out of the Town of Richmond . Apropos , I beg you will walk as far as Governor Pownall 's house , opposite the Star & Garter , and the next time you condescend to write , be so good as to tell Me if it stands just where it did . It was there , I drove my Porcupine the Morning we were Married , to spend a few days in solitary Retirement , according to the Barbarous practice of the present civilized Ages . I have ever since called the place Siberia , & constantly Vow never to be guilty of such an Absurdity when I marry again . You accuse Me of Reserve , because I did not tell You I had been in London last October . Truly , if I omitted that peice of intelligence , it was because I had forgot it . I went to Town because the Order for all Officers to join their Regiments obliged Me to do so , and I returned the moment I could ob tain leave wh ich was not 'till I had dangled for upwards of a Month at the War Office . As to the rest of my Journey , it was productive of Promises without Performances , according to the laudable Custom of all Ministers and all Administrations . Had the promises been fullfilled , I should before this time , have been my Own Master , retired from His Majesty 's Service , of which I am most heartily satisfied . You may amend the reading , by changing the of into a with , and adding a dis before satisfied . As to our meeting , I presume it will be on the other side of Blue Mantle , as my purse will not permit Me to indulge my penchant for travell ing . A journey from Edinr . to London w ould cost Me , en famille , £100 , Ditto the return . My house to be kep't up at Edinr- , another to be hired in London , & no sinking fund to draw on for defraying the extraordinary expence . If ever I contrive to reach the Capital , there I must remain ; when my Boy is fit to go to School ( not yet being two Years old ) I propose educating him in England , for the sake of the language , and as You are of the Blue Stocking Tribe shall certainly consult You on the proper mode of conducting a matter of such importance . In the mean time , with every affectionate wish for yourself , Mr. Dickenson & the Kitten , in which Maria begs leave to join , I remain ever Your faithfull friend & affectionate Brother Napier Best Compts- to Mr. Jackson & Miſs A. Clarke . I rejoice to find the Stormonts still Gracious -- I return to Axwell Park next Saturday and to Edinr- about the middle of next Month -- Gateshead August twenty eight 1788 Mrs- Dickenson at John Jackson Esqr- Richmond Surrey Free Tho : Clavering
