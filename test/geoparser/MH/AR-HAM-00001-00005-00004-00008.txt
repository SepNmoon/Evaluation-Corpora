My Dear Sr . I am extremely sorry that having received your Letter when very particularly engaged with the Regiment I unfortunately destroyed it I fear with other papers -- I have in vain endeavord to recover it -- & to have found myself in such a situation as to have been able to give my aſsistance to the Gentleman you recommend ; but I have long ago had so many & such warm recommendations from particular friends that I realy must decline interesting myself on this occasion -- I am not a Governor but confeſs I have a general accquaintance with them -- I should be extremely sorry to go counter to their wishes & amidst the number of applications I have received I shall not be able to know how to act -- I am very glad to congratulate you on Mrs. Dickenson s recoving her health & I shall at all times be happy to aſsure you in person of the real Interest I feel for your Wellfare -- how long I stay here I know not as I believe my Regt . will be soon removed from hence : I can not answer for my time if I should know any thing for certain I will inform you in the hopes of having the pleasure of seeing you & Mrs. Dickenson -- Lady Warwick joins in Compliments & good wishes to you & her -- I can not wish your family better than mine is -- I have no leſs than 8 Children at home -- who with their Grandfather two Aunts and a Cousin make a tolerable family party -- My chief Employment now is -- cutting down Trees of my own planting I have between 20 , & 30,000. which I must destroy -- I wish I could send them to you & my other friends -- as they are uncommonly fine but -- they are at least 30 or 40 feet high -- so that I can not do otherwise than cut them down . I am My Dear Sr . Your faithful friend & c . Warwick Warwick Castle August 25 th 1794 --
