May 24 th . 1810 Dr Mrs Dickenson I am very sorry that I -- could not have the pleasure of waiting on you and Mr D—— yesterday Evening ; believe me no Syren Songs were neceſsary to induce me to much wish it had been in my power to accept of your obliging invitation the truth is I was obliged to remain at home having a Swelled face & if I had venturd to have shewn it at all it must have been in the H . of Lords whither my bounden Duty directed me to be . I am truly concerned to hear that Mrs. Holman is not eſsentially recovering & that the worst may be Expected your kind attention must be highly gratifying to my Uncle . I feel quite inclined to do all I poſsibly can to relieve his Anxiety & distreſs but I have not the power to be of the least Service I fear . Believe me always Dr Mrs Dickenson Yours sincerely & c Warwick P.S . I am desired by Ly W to say that she was so completely tired as to be unfit to go out & was obliged to Nurse herself for the future calls of Duty which indeed seem by no means light -- My Son is at Thorncliff with his miserable reduced Regt . -- The French fotilla is out he saw 22 Sail & as he prefers staying in England to going to Ireland where he is destined to be as soon as ye Regt . is fit for Service he hopes to see some more -- Certain it is the Signal was made sent & Expreſs sent to Admiral in the Downs to be on ye Alert . --
