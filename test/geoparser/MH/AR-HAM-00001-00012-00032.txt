Caldas July 4 th . 1781 My Dearest Miſs —— , My last Letter inform 'd you of our Diſsappointment in Mrs . Fielding s having left us , just before Mr . Fielding arrived at Lisbon , but now I have a much more distreſsing Event to tell , for last Night I was shock't with receiving a Letter from her , dated Vigo in Spain June 26 th . informing me that soon after She sail 'd in the Mercury Packet the 17 th . from Lisbon , they were chased for 12 hours , and at last taken by an American Privateer the horror of finding what hands they wase fallen into was very great , but thank God they have met with humane Treatment from them , and they have landed them at Vigo , from whence she writes , having by great good fortune found an Opportunity of sending a Letter hither . Mr . & Mrs. Graham Miſs Cathcart and herself are all lodged in a miserable House like a Barn , but thankful to have so escaped . They have sent for Paſs-ports , and I hope will determine to go to Oporto which is but two Days Journey from thence ; there they will be well off , both from the place itself , and from the kindneſs of a Mr. Brett , a Merchant of Oporto , who fortunately we had made Acquaintance with here , and who has been so good as to write to give them Credit and the Use of his House and every Aſsistance in their power till they can determine what farther to do . This Letter we sent there by Expreſs last Night , but the Distance is very great and we are not sure of finding them there , but hope it is impoſsible they can have taken any steps yet , that can have determin 'd them to go any other way . we also sent another Expreſs to Lisbon to Mr . Fielding to inform him of it , which will bring him here again as soon as poſsible , and we propose he should go to Oporto and fetch her back here . I hope in God this Project will succeed , for I shall be distreſs 'd and unhappy till I have her again safe ; I must not expect that comfort this fortnight or three weeks , for there never was such a country for Travelling in , no poſsibility of change of Horses or Mules , but the same pair goes all the way to an open chaise . and they must be sent ōn purpose for there are none at Oporto , and bett between Vigo and Oporto none can go , they must have tillers . indeed my dear I am distreſs 'd and vext beyond measure , tho I am sure I ought to feel happy and thankful they were not carried to America . I had pleas 'd myself with thinking she must have been arriv 'd in England long since , and might have had the honor & happineſs of Seeing their Majesties and they dear Royal Children , she went charged with my most Dutiful Thanks to the King & Queen for all their goodneſs & indulgence to me , which I had long wish 'd for an Opportunity of expreſsing in a more particular Manner than I have ever been able to do , and also with Letters to the three Princeſses . pray my Dear mention this with my humble Duty . the hurry I now write in does not permit of my having the honor of writing my Letters to them over again , but will take the first Opportunity of doing it . Mrs . Fielding was also to have represented my situation to their Majesties , with respect to my son , and requested their Leave to prolong my stay , till I could leave him with an easy mind . I thank God , he continues in a way to be well , and has so much hopes of it himself , that he has set at Liberty Dr. Payne his Physician who was Originally going to England on his own private Affairs And whose situation then , calls him back to America , Ld- Wina . thought , whatever satisfaction he or I might derive from keeping him with us a little longer , it was not fair by him , but that as soon as it was poſsible he ought to let him go . I really flatter myself from what Dr. Payne says , that Ld . Winchelsea is now in a manner free from the illneſs itself , but the Consequences of it still remain and will sometime , which shew themselves , in the swelling of his Legs , & weakneſs in walking , or standing , attended with pains in the joints , some fix't and some flying ones . Dr. Payne says , with Care , Gentle Exercise , & great attention to Diet , added to the pursuing of these waters , & some physical Method he has put him in , he has the greatest hope he will perfectly recover . I own his going away ( tho I could not oppose it ) was rather distreſsful to me , as he was the only person that really knows the whole of his Case , And as ( Under God ) we must impute his Recovery to his Skill and Care . My son and I are both anxious on every Account to see his recovery advance , so as to admit of my Return , being fully and gratefully sensible of their Majesties great kindneſs & indulgence about my Absence , it shall not be prolong 'd a Moment beyond what is neceſsary , but how my dear Miss —— , I am to get home with safety , now the Seas are so infested I do not know . A Land Journey would ruin my finances , besides the difficulties of travelling thro Spain & Portugal , and the tedious time it would take , and as to the Packet I certainly now can never Venture it . A Neutral Ship must be our resource , whenever the happy time comes , that I can see my son so restor 'd as to leave him with ease & Hope . His paſsing the Winter abroad seems so neceſsary , that he has not an Idea of coming to England himself . I Hope , I shall soon have the pleasure of a Letter from You , & continued good Accounts of all the Royal Family , And all my friends at Windsor . I shall write again as soon as I h er e have any thing to say more about poor Mrs . Fielding , who will at best have a long & very Uncomfortable Journey to make , in order to come hither . I am ever Most Affly .. & Sincerely Yrs . CFinch
