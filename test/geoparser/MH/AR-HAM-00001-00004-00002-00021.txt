My dear Sir , I can not well expreſs my obligations for your very kind letters which I have received yesterday & to day ; as I am aware of the great danger that attends my dear daughter 's disorder my affliction & anxiety are inexpreſsible , she was precisely in the same situation here , three years ago under the care of Dr. Parry , who had the greatest apprehensions for her but after having been inflated in the most dreadful manner with excruciating pain she returned to her usual shape in one night 's time , but as she has had since frequent relapses , I consider her in very great danger & am therefore anxious beyond measure that the ablest advice may be immediately call 'd in . Having had many opportunities of discovering my dearest daughter 's excellent disposition during her late severe trials , I flatterd myself she might be permitted to enjoy , even in this life , some years of happineſs , but if this is not to be granted , it woud ill become me not to submit to the dispensations of providence with patience & humble resignation ; the reflexion of my having acquitted myself to this dear & invaluable friend in the crisis of her affliction will be my principal consolation , shoud it be the will of Providence to take her from us . I find myself so overcome with distreſs , that I must beg you will excuse my quitting this painful subject , but it must not be without repeating my most grateful thanks to you & Mrs. Dickenson for your very affectionate attention , I remain My dear Sir , Your faithful humble Servant Frederick Hamilton Brock St . Bath May 20 th . 1810 My best Compts . to Miſs Dickenson John Dickenson Esqr 49 . Welbeck Street London
