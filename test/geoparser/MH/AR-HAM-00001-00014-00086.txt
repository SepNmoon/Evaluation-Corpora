I am really anxious my Dearest to hear how you have paſsed your Night , for I fear you have not slept , pray let me know & whether you are not hurried out of your Senses . Believe me my Dear I feel most gratefully your Affectionate attention to me , I have a grateful heart , and I shall ever feel it , I was sorry I did not see you last Night , had I heard your Voice , tho I was stepping into Bed I should have desired you to walk in . Can I or any body belonging to me be of any use to you , pray if I can let me know . Will you be so good as to present my Duty & Love to the Dear Princeſs 's & say how very sensible I am of their goodneſs to me I am sure they will behave as well as poſsible to you , as it will be a great ease to my mind as you have so much additional trouble upon my account , if I poſsibly can I will answer their kind Notes but writing does not agree very well with my poor good for nothing Chest . I must trouble you my Dst to thank Mlle Moula for her very kind Note , & to tell her what I have ordered her Dinner at two o ' Clock as Ly Charlotte desired me , that she might return in to the Nursery at three , to set you at Liberty . Adieu my Dst my kind Comps to all the Nursery & believe me most Affly Yr- MCG -- pray kiſs Prſs Mary for me as she can not understand my Duty in other ways --
