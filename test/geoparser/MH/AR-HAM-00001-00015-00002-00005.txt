Eastbourne Monday 19 th . June 1780 This is the first moment I have had my Dearest friend to tell you I am well & happy -- pleased -- infinitely pleased wth . my present situation -- delighted with our society , wch . consists of Ldy . C Finch -- whom ( you know I love wth . ye . same tenderneſs as o i f she was my Mother ) Mr. Bruyeres -- Mr. Farrel , -- Mr. Fisher , -- the two latter are but the acquaintance of a very few days , but they appear in an advantageous light from their conversation & manner , & I can not help thinking from the countenance of each , that they have good minds -- Mr Bruyeres if poſsible improves upon acquaintance ; now I have told you of our society I must inform you that our Journey was extremely pleasant -- the roads the whole way perfectly good -- the views charming , particularly after we quitted East Grinstead to Ucfield -- from thence till within 7 or 8 miles of this place the prospect was not so extensive -- the scene became more domestic -- fields of beautiful verdure enclosed by wth fine Hedge rows . as we approach 'd nearer ye .
