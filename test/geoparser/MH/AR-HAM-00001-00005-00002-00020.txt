Park Street 7 Aug : 1794 I need not say the receiving my Dear Mrs. Dickenson s kind letter gave me great pleasure , as she knows too well herself the feelings it ocasions to hear of a valued Friend whose silence has given pain and the more for being ocasioned by her ill health : the acount you are so kind to give of it makes us very happy , as we hope there is every reason to flatter ourselves that your long and painful complaint is got the better of , and that you will enjoy many years of health and all the comforts you so well deserve -- your scheme of returning to Bath is a very good one both for your own health and the fair Louisa 's improvement so that I hope nothing will interfere with its being executed -- Mr. Muirhead and Lady Jane are with the Duke of Atholl at Blair but leave it the 2 4 of this month to return South and supose by Oct : will be resettled at Bath , Lady Amelia Cooke is at present at Lord George Murray 's in Kent but will return to Bath I understand when Lady Jane does -- the acount you have heard of the Dutcheſs of Atholl is the general one , I never met with a more uniform and general great Character than she has : she is a very Elegant preaty Woman but Delicate in health and make , is two and thirty which is a very proper age to be an agreable friend and companion to him and also a f proper age and experience to introduce and Educate his Children -- her behaviour to Lord Mcleod who was old enough to be her father and during her widowhood has been so much what it should be , that there is every reason to expect as well as hope , it will prove a happy choice for themselves and All Concerned : the Duke is deserving of every domestic happineſs for I never met with any man more so his atention to his first Wife which living so much with them as we have , I am a good judge of , and that to his children can not be too much admired and am sure if any body is unhappy with him it must be their own fault : at his time of life and with such a familly of Children it was the best thing and the properest he could do and as he aſsured me he had not made his choice without anxiously endevoring to promote his childrens happineſs as well as his own I sincerely hope he will be rewarded as he deserves -- poor Miſs Cathcart s delicate constitution alarms her friends very much , this has been a very severe attack upon it , and I am very anxious about her , but have got no intelligence as every body is out of town and when I called at the house it was with difficulty I got the door opened by a Girl who said the Porter was out , and She only knew the familly were all at Caen wood and very well : so it is plain she knew nothing of the matter -- the great fortune Lady Bath has disposed of herself at last to her Cousin Sir James Murray ( now Pulteney ) -- if She will give him the power have no doubt he will do honor to her choice and the great Fortune they poſseſs , as he was so generous on his small paternal one that there is no doubt of his having a good , as well as generous heart , of which I know several traits another great fortune ( in expectation ) is agoing to dispose of herself to Mr. Drummond of Logie Almond a very handsome young man Nephew to Lord Dunmore -- if She turns out the fortune it will be a great Match for him , but if disapointed of it will prove a bad one for Both : as I think a young Woman brought up in all the Extravagancy and gaity she has is but ill suited to marry and retire into Perthshire upon a moderate income . I supose you must know her mother Mrs : Charles Boone ; Mr. Boone first married a great fortune , a sister to the late Lady Ashburnham s and since that a shewy Young Woman by whom he has only two daughters one suposed far gone in a decline he is very rich but will not tye himself down so time must shew how it will turn out -- H . R . H . separation from Mrs. Fitzherbert is not to be wonder 'd at the wonder was , it did not take place before , and the event clearly proves those in the right that never allowed the coniction to be a matrimonial one -- those that so obseqiously bowed to a Princeſs must feel very small at present ; I should think , but that is their Affair -- luckily I am out of that scrap e never chuseing to have any thing to do with such quondam Princeſses nothing is here said about his marrying -- an attatchment to Lady Jersey is much talked of ; which from her Character , her beauty and adreſs , is very likly to be true ! Lord Jersey being anxious for a house near Windsor confirms the report -- the only odd thing is , that age should always prove so charming ! -- politics I can send none ; the World seems so involved in trouble and perplexity all over the face of the globe that it is wonderfull and nothing can acount for it but that the Decrees of Providence are fullfilling in a way to high for us to understand , the only sure comfort to be found in su ch times is a firm reliance on His goodneſs who over rul es All things that He will save and protect those who tru st in Him and suddenly turn and grant us peace . My Husband you know is now Rear Admiral of the Red and has the command at Halifax for which station he sailed the 18 of last May no acount has come of him since but I trust the next packet will bring us good acounts it seems a very long time . I endevor to amuse myself with music drawing & c for to take up thought but spight of all I never found time apear to go so slow ; however I comfort myself that no news is good news as the bad always flies -- this year has certainly called forth great excersions of spirits to suport the loſs of so good a husband , to mourn for my Brother , and for my Husband s brother has been a series of events that have gradualy followed each other and made me a mourner since Novr . till just now -- but we were not sent into this world for our pleasure and if we look round certainly have so many bleſsings to the thankfull for that it would be ingratitude to repine at what is the lot of Man -- tho ' it requires resolution to be thankfull & submit with chearfullneſs -- the King looks very well the Queen very thin and so does P. Royal -- the others all well tho ' I think the P. of Wales & D. of Clarence very much alter 'd -- P. Ernest is very tall but the same face has his left arm in a sling -- I give you this act of those I know you will be glad to hear of I go to the drawing room as it is an expected duty -- but to no other public place , as I can not reconcile it a right thing when those we are most nearly concerned for may be God knows in what situation to be flirting about at idle places -- as I have no children to amuse am sure I have no business at them -- My Sister on the whole is in much better looks & health than formly tho ' am sorry to say far from good health -- we are very glad to hear Miſs Dickenson s is much improved -- beg to be kindly remember 'd to her . we hope you will have a pleasant tour the Weather is delightfull and the country you will be pleased with in Westmorland -- I am very glad to hear you propose to turn over a new leaf I shall be content to experience one out of the Oldest Book that I mean in which you used to write often to my Dear Mrs. Dickenson Your affectionate & sincere friend Wilhelmina Murray My Sister joyns me in love to yrself & best wishes to Mr Dickenson & Louisa -- 3-17-0 3-15-9 ½ 0- 1-2 ½ 1-0-0 Mrs Dickenson Post Office Liverpool a single sheet
