71 , Queen Street 30 th - Decrr 1806 My Dear Sister , Since I have no longer the power of franking , I have abridged as much as poſsible , the number of my Correspondents , not chusing to put them to the expence of paying for my dull stupid scrawls . And , as I know You would have early intelligence of my Defeat , at the Election on the 4 th Instant , from the Newspapers , I really did not conceive that You would have expected the disagreeable intelligence to be sent to You , by myself . I had the weight of Government against me ; but I have the satisfaction of reflecting , that the Opposition was honourable to Me . Would I have given up my Friends , I might have had my Name inserted in the Ministerial List . But , having all my Life presumed to follow my own Will , and that Will not agreeing with the Ministers , of course , I lost my Election . You will be surprised when I tell You , that I failed , having the Majority of Peers , who voted , in my favour . This appears odd , but was occasioned by the way , in which , the Votes were chequered . My supporters were , the Dukes of Buccleuch , Lennox , Gordon , Argyll , Atholl , Montrose , the Earls of Craufurd , Morton , Caithneſs , Moray , Home , Strathmore , Abercorn , Kellie , Haddington , Galloway , Kinnoull , Dalhousie , Leven , Balcarres , Aboyne , Aberdeen , Dunmore , Hyndford , Glasgow , Bute , Hopetoun , Deloraine , Viscounts Stormont , Arbuthnot , Lords Cathcart , Sinclair , Torphichen , Napier , Reay & Elibank . 36 . My opponents were , The Dukes of Rothsay , P : of W . , Earls of Queensberry , Errol , Eglinton , Caſsillis , Lauderdale , Elgin , Dysart , Selkirk , Northesk , Dundonald , Kintore , Breadalbane , Stair , Roseberry , Viscounts Portmore , Falkland , Lords Dunblane , Forbes , Sempill , Elphinstone , Somerville , Blantyre , Colvill , Kirkcudbright , Belhaven , Rollo , 28 , to which must be added the Claimant of the Dukedom of Roxburgh , & the Claimant of the Earldom of Marchmont , who both voted on the Ministerial side , though the House of Lords have not yet decided on their Claims . On comparing the Names , on the above Lists , I have no reason to be ashamed at the loſs of my Election . Whether my office will go too , I shall not know , till I write the usual Letter of application , in the Month of March ; but , it is to be presumed that it will be an Object for some of the Ministers friends . The probability therefore is , that I shall be left to live out the remainder of my Days in a State of peaceful retirement . So , that if You dont wander to this Country , it may be long enough before we meet again . Now for a reply to all your Queries & c -- I never see Kinnaird -- My Son Colonel Graham , is at Sea , on board the Imperieuse Frigate , commanded by William , and is too keen a Sailor to waste his precious time , in journeying to this Country -- Lord Cochrane is now at Dunira , with The Justice Clark -- Your Letter shall be burnt , according to your Orders -- You must not direct to me under Cover to any Member of Parliament , more especially under Cover to Lord Melville -- I am not likely to meet with Lord Cathcart , ( late Mrs Campbell ) , as I do not aſsociate with her Husband . His father , Miſs Wynne , has a large Estate , but is not Brother to Mr. Campbell of Shawfield . His eldest Son married the Duke 's daughter the late Duke of Argyll -- As this is an Age of Wonders , instead of Frost & Snow , we have the verdure of Spring at Christmas . The frequent Storms of Wind & Rain , have been most tremendous , and have rendered the walking about intolerably disagreeable . My Lungs play best , in clear frosty Weather , for which , I most ardently long ; but , very much fear it will not come till next Midsummer . Adieu , My Dear Sister . Best love to Lady Charlotte , Mr. Dickenson , Countrywoman & c My Rib & Progeny are in good health . Ever Your faithful & affecte- Brother Louisa P.S . When You are idle , remember , I dont grudge postage . Napier Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds
