Taxal Tuesday July 30 th : 1771 How shall I expreſs my gratitude my dear Miſs Hamilton , for the great Friendship you have honour 'd me with , & for the many Civilities your good Papa & Mama have been so obliging to shew to my dear Boy , which he is perpetually talking of ? we think him much grown , & improved ; & I hope he is good ; his dispositions seem at present such as we cou 'd wish ; I pray God to continue them so ! & that he may increase in Virtue & Religion rather than Fortune . Your dispositions my Dr : Miſs H have taken a happy turn ; you lay out your whole time in the improvement of your mind , & have no leisure for those Childish diſsipations so natural to your Sex & Age ; Go on , & be the delight of your fond parents , as well as all your acquaintance ; for I am certain you have so much Humility that it will preserve you from pedantry , a character which in our Sex is very disagreeable , & is the cause why a Wise Woman is in general disliked , the Men wou 'd have no Rivals in knowledge , & are angry at every Woman who shall attempt it . but the truth is , our Sex are very apt to be proud of what they know , & this is the true cause , why we are despised , a fund of useful knowledge in either Sex is highly commendable , if they keep in View the Ultimate End of all Learning ; the Glory of God ; & knowledge of ones self . this , my dear Miſs Hamilton I think I can see by your Conversation & Letters , is your pursuit ; & whilst you keep this point in view , your Studys will always give you sattisfaction , you may look back with pleasure on the time you have spent on them , & you will have the heartfelt Joy of self approbation , which will support you through all the Calamities & vexations of this foolish Life ; to which every situation is liable . But I find I am preaching a Sermon , instead of writing a Letter . I fear I shall prove an odd Correspondent for a young Lady , but remember 't is your own fault , you woud have me write to you . Jack tells me , you are at present employ 'd in working Chairs , I admire your taste , in having one single figure ; it is much more Elegant , than being crouded full of different things , as is generally the case . it is very entertaining work , tho ' reckon 'd bad for the shape . I Shall long to see them , when they are finish 'd . You are very kind in wishing to see yo me , if Northn : was not so far off , I believe I shoud indulge myself in taking a trip to you ; but at present must content myself with hearing from my good Friends there ; who I have a sincere regard for . I hope Mr Lawton & Mr will accept my most sin cere respects ; & acknowledgments , for all th eir favours ; in which Mrs. : Hamilton begs to joyn ; & beli eve me Dr : Mr D ( with a thousand kind wishes for your Health & happineſs ) your sincere Friend Miſs H S Dickenson desires her most Affcet service to you . you are a violent favorite with her . Sally Northampton
