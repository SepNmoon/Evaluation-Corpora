March the 24 th 1787 My dear Friend ! I thought it long before I heard from you because I was impatient & anxious for a particular account of you & your little love -- I know it was unreasonable to expect you to write sooner than you did , when I am aware of the many demands your Friends make upon you . I rejoice so sincerely in your happineſs ! do you ever sleep ? for I think I never should , for some Months at least if I had so delightful & dear an object to occupy my thoughts -- I am mortified that you could not nurse it yourself -- how did this happen ? Bell never mentioned this circumstance to me , or indeed any other , but that you were brought to bed of a Daug hter and very well . you continue perfectly so I hope & your little Girl -- what is her name & who stood for her . Is Mr Dickenson better -- & how long do you continue at Bath -- I wish to be answered on all these points , and wish it much , tho ' you have reason to doubt it , & to wonder at my having allowed three weeks to ellapse without answeri n g your letter . I can not account for this silence satisfactorily to you my dear Friend nor to myself , tho ' I feel how incapa ble I have been for this Month past of writi n g a line to any bei n g or of doi n g anything else that afforded a minutes pleasure at the time or that left one pleasi n g idea or reflection behind it -- since the return of my family I am never left a minute to myself , & tho ' I can not regret this , or wish to have employed the hours I spend with them , in any other manner , the constant diſsipation of the mind , & impoſsibility of application to anythi n g , is very disagreeable , & very dangerous -- inshort it has broke into all my plans of occupation & has unhinged me quite -- I feel desœuvre ed diſsipated , without an object or a pursuit which is worse than death to me , this produces disgust , disatisfaction , & a total incapacity of exertion there lye my Memoirs , my Euclid & c there my paper pen & ink -- here I sit & talk or listen , go out & come home , dreſs & ennuyer myself duri n g a long long Eveni n g , 3 times in the week with the Queen , 4 times without her -- this has been my situation & journal for this month past -- & a most dreadful & uncomfortable one it has been -- you my dear Friend have been long acustomed to my changes & inconsistences , to my Fits & Starts & will therefore pity & not blame me -- so I am -- dependant on circumstances , on humours , on Events , not for my principles or my opinions but very much for my comfort & my bien etre the last time I wrote to you I was all elasticity spring , eager , occupied , happy -- since then in the state I have been describi n g -- I am begin n i n g to emerge from it now , & the first proof symptom I have perceived of my approachi n g change , is my ability to write to you -- The Weather is heavenly , & in Easter week I go out of Town -- to Richmond Park , where the air , the liberty & the quiet will restore my health & spirits , for tho ' I have no particular complaint , I feel oppreſsed , heavy , stupid , inshort the disorder of London , of havi n g been immured here for Month s I have been scarce ever in publick however , except with the Queen , tho ' you might have suspected I had lived there from what I have said -- I dine every day with my Father -- by the by they are all perfectly well -- & Is behaves extremely so -- I have seen Lady Wake twice -- we called upon her one Mor n i n g , & met her another -- she looks very well , & says Miſs Wake is much better . Mrs Walsingham & I have entirely lost sight of each other -- we have never had any quarel or t he appearance of one , yet she never asks me to her House & we do but just speak -- this is odd n'estce pas after all we remember -- Miſs Boyle is presented & out in the World but not liked , & a true Miſs -- my dear frie nd write to me everythi n g you think & do -- & do not spare my money -- could you imagine I could grudge it , or think of it -- you must not direct under cover to S.G.E . I will endeav our to get this franked to you either to day or Monday -- this is a true scrawl , but I have to finish it before my Sister returns who is gone to pay some visits , when I recollect that I have filled it with my complaints , caprices & contrarietys , I can not help thinki n g it almost too great a trespaſs upon even your indulgence -- I conclude with the aſsurance of my sincere & tender affection for you -- God bleſs you my dear Friend yours ever CMGunning . my kind Compts to Mr Dickenson -- London March twenty fourth 1787 Mrs Dickenson Abbey Street Bath Free Geo : Fitzroy Honble .
