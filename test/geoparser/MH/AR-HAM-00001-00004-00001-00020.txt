Sackville Street Dublin December 29 th . 1781 . My Dear Miſs Hamilton I have at last receiv 'd your long expected letter , for be aſsured that I am not in default as I answerd your very obliging letter of the 31 st . of May last a few days after it came to hand , & put it into the Post Office myself for its greater security , & I am in hopes you will recollect having receiv 'd that letter which you might very well have forgot , from the constant hurry of your attendance . I am very glad to hear that your constitution seems to have taken a turn so much for the better , but still I cou 'd wish that it migh t not be put to too severe a trial , tho ' I wou 'd strenuously recommend a steady perseverance however attended with difficulties . I am persuaded you require no incitement to carry you on , and I have the firmest hopes that the period is not far distant , when finding yourself in a state of more independence , you will look back with pleasure to the steps that have led you to it . As I have every poſsible reason to be convinced of the sincerity of your regard for me , the goodneſs of your mind united to a sound understanding having inclined you to consider parts of my conduct towards you in their proper light , my attachment to you will for the remainder of my life be firm & sincere , & tho my situation will never permit me to be a useful friend , I shall at least be a safe one , as I have an abhorrence to all oblique & interested ideas , and your having hazarded a very dangerous step on my account was the most convincing proof of your faithful attachment to me , but not to be attempted again . I have now been fully Twenty Five years in Ireland with the same Preferment , with connections avowedly superior to almost any Persons of the same Profeſsion in this country . I have seen in that period of Time a series of Men of the lowest claſs with respect either to birth or merit raised to the highest stations , to these they have ascended either by base marriages , by servile situations in great Families , by being The Managers of Corporations & Borroughs , not to mention country Schoolmasters & College Tutors . My Rank in life , did not at my setting out , prompt me to aspire after merit in any of these departments . I cou 'd have no other dependence but on the zealous protection of my Family connections , and principally from a great Personage having condescended to adopt his Royal Father s intentions towards me , which was most expreſsly signified to me upon various occasions . But I am leading you through a tiresome deduction of circumstances to the scope of my letter , which at last is this , whatever my feelings may be from having been so long neglected & forgot without indulging myself in unavailing complaints , I mean to retire satisfied with the independent state I find myself in by the bounty of Providence , & after having resigned my Living , of which I have already notified my intention to my Bishop , I propose to go to Geneva , there to reside for some time at least , solely for the benefit of my children , where I shall superintend their education . My Son now ten years old , has but a weak constitution , having never recover 'd the inoculation . My Daughter now past thirteen years old is in a much happier state , as she enjoys perfect health , her education being already well advanced , and as she has talents to qualify her to reap every benefit from the society of well educated persons . The idea of serving these Children so eſsentially makes me overlook every thing that may not be so flattering to myself . As for worldly views they will not enter much into my future plan ; the having at last put a period to painful pursuits after advancement , will in itself be to me a state of happineſs greater than I have ever yet enjoy 'd . These were my Ideas & Wishes many years ago , but I permitted them to give way to the persuasions of my Friends . If I cou 'd have -- weakneſs enough at my age to engage in a new round of pursuits , to expect to create new interests , for those I have are good for nothing , when old age h as overtaken me . I shou 'd most probably have cause to lament that my latte r follies were greater than my first . I propose to part with all my Persona l Property in this Country as soon as I can find Purchasers . The Management of my Estates both here and in Scotland , is , I hope , in such a train as will not require my Attendance . I will take care to give very particular instructions that your Remittance may be made punctually . My Affairs will not I believe permit me to leave Ireland sooner than the Month of June next . I have already sold my House in Town , having had the idea of paſsing the winter at my Villa , but finding it cold & solitary I have taken a House in Sackville Street for the time I propose to remain in Ireland & it happens to be one that I had formerly occupied . I have long thought myself something of a Philosopher , I hope in the retreat I have chosen to make further progreſs in sentiments of contentment & chearful resignation , for a diſsatisfied & repining spirit is truely contemptible . I please myself with the idea of being able to say when I shall write to you from that retreat tandem tranquillus , I make no Apology for a sentence of Latin , for I remember you once surpriz 'd me with a whole letter in that language . If you shou 'd happen to be in London when I paſs through it I shall be most happy to call upon you to aſsure you once more in Person that I am My Dear Elizabeth Your very faithful & Affecte Uncle Miſs Hamilton P s ... Frederick Hamilton desires to be remember 'd to you , pray do not forget me to Mrs .. H . & the Grevilles to Cathcarts only for form sake .
