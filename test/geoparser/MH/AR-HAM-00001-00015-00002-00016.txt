My Dearest love -- I do not find myself stout enough this Eveg to venture out for ye . first time , besides I am low & an unfit visitor for you ; I hope my love You heard I sent last night & this Morng . -- the accounts from You were very uncomfortable , & Dr . & Mr. D- told me they found you still ye . same , & still imagin 'd you wd . have the Measles . I send a Book for Yor . amusement , I hope you have not seen it , Lettice can read it to you , for I do not suppose you ought , & indeed I fear can not read long together at a time Yourself -- If you have every made the different Stiles of the Great Masters your Painters Your study , this Book can not fail of entertaining you , & if you have not it will still amuse you as the language is good & there is a vivacity that keeps up ye . attention -- add to this , it was written by young Beckford . Adieu my Dear Dear friend God grant You a speedy recovery . Miranda 7 th . June 1781 Mary Hamilton 7 th June 1781
