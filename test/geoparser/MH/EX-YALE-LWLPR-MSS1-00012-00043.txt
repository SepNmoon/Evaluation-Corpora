Tuesday 3 o'clock If Mr Walpole does not apply very improperly to Mi≈øs Hamilton , which perhaps he does , & shall not be quite sorry if he does , will she be so good as to tell him one word of poor Mrs Vesey , & when he may have leave to wait on her . He is but this moment come to town , & therefore hopes to be pardoned , if he does any thing wrong in giving this trouble . Honble H Walpole June 7 th 1785
