Exeter Friday 10 Sepr I was extremely glad to see the Paynters set off on Acct . of the appearance of the o ldest as I think he may die very suddenly -- The younger has an uncommon red face as far as his Eye brows like Mrs White & is so near sited that he comes into a room with his Eyes closed & when he has advanced two or 3 yards his Eye Lids begin to Twinkle & you can perceive that he has Eyes -- by Candlelight they have uncommonly brilliancy & look beautiful -- when he came to breakfast this morning he said his Nose had bled twice yesterday & this morning he awoke wh- his Mouth full of blood -- he is a very clever young Man -- They disappointed us of setting out to day as they seemed undecided & therefore I could not give a hint that we were going the same way -- When they went I took my fishing rod but the water was not in a proper State & then I went out with my Gun for an hour but could not fin d Thursday -- The morning was very wet & kept us in susp ense about 12 it cleared & as soon as yr- 3 d . letter arrived we set out & stopt to feed our horses at Brickleigh where Bamfield More Cerew was born & buried -- in our Way to this place we paſsed Mr. Worth 's of Worth whos wife committed a faux pas with a Footman & was packed off -- Mr. W . is a very handsome Man & has a large fortune & was made very miserable by the misconduct of his Wife who had several Children -- We also paſsed the House at Washfield where Hatfield lived & flourished away for a Year with a beautiful Wife before he married Mary of Buttermere & was hanged for franking a Letter -- We paſsed at a Miles distance Killerton the Seat of Sir T. Dyke Ackland & saw Sir Stafford Northcote s place -- The Vale from Tiverton is very fine & at Brickleigh it begins to expand thro very rich land & forms a wide Valley with the Ex in the middle of it & the sides of the hills covered at intervalls with fine Woods -- adjoining every House & Cottage is an Orchard -- this year wearing a melancholy appearance as there is great dependance on Apples for Cyder , the great beverage of the Country -- these Orchards when the Trees are in bloom in the spring must have a charming Effect as few things equal in beauty the Apple bloſsom -- Miſs Parkin promised me great pleasure from the prospect from 3 mile hill near Exeter & said so much that I fancied the imagination was already satisfied & expected the natural Consequence -- but my Admiration of the Scene far exceeded all expectation & I was in raptures -- The View is bounded in various parts by the horizon at such distance that a further extent could not gratify the natural sight & the Mind remains satisfied -- this enchanting Scenery consists of /an immense extent of the richest Land & the Green is so thickly interspersed wh- the Yellow that it increases the gratification by a conviction of the plenty produced by the Cultivation of so rich a Soil with the bleſsing of providence -- the Hills rise to a considerable heigth & are either clothed wh- fine Woods or cultivated to their Summits -- on what side soever you look the Scenery is equally fine -- When we arrived at the Summit of the hill we looked down upon Exeter & Exmouth & the Country beyond these places can not be exceed in beauty any where -- We got to Exeter at 6 & immediately began to take a view of the City we saw before it was dark almost every part -- We went to the Cathedral just at the moment when they were concluding a Rehearsal for Monday when Catalani is to sing & we fixed wh- a young Man to play the Organ for us tomorrow -- There is a walk near the the Castle called Northonly -- where there are several broad Walks midst lofty Elms that conceal the Rays of the Sun & where several thousands may walk at a time -- here on a Sunday aſsemble the whole people of Exeter who are inclined to walks & there are stationed 2 or 3 bands of Music at different parts -- You can form no idea of the beauty & luxury of this place without seeing it -- We dined as soon as it became dark & in course of time went to bed -- Friday -- This morning I sallied out before my Companion was up & went to see the House of Correction which has cost an immense sum -- I measured 600 feet in front & then I went to the Barracks which are very extensive -- A Cart load of Lime Stone paſsed containing a beautiful red Stone striated wh- white that gives it an appearance of Marble -- After breakfast -- at wch . John Mrs. P . s youngest Son partook -- a fine boy of 12 -- I did not forget the Schoolboy -- we went to Mr. Leakey to see his pictures -- his portraits are good & his likeneſses strong & his Landscapes have great Merit -- We then went to the Cathedral to hear a little of the Organ & to inform the young man that we could not stay to day to hear him -- I saw the Bishop sitting in his magnificent throne & he saw me -- Parkin ran up to the Organ to make an excuse & the young Man took an Oppy during the Chant to give a delicate expreſsion of the full Organ which astonished me -- There is a separate Arrangment of pipes of prodigious thickneſs diameter that produces a Sound unexampled -- We set out for Exmouth & I disputed wh- James that he was going a wrong way he said he had been repeatedly at Exmouth so I submitted -- when we had proceeded a mile we met some of his acquaintances who laught at him & set us right , by his wrong headedneſs we lost 3 miles -- we came into the right road again at Sir J. Duckworth at Wear 2 miles fm . Exeter a pretty place -- When Sir J . was on a Voyage he observed a Pig had fallen into the Sea -- he immeadiately ordered the Ship to wear the poor pig he cr ied out will be drown lower a boat directly & take it up -- Some one unfortunately said the pig belonged to a Midshipman -- Sir J . then said Oh poor pig must be drowned -- we ca n't stop the Ship for a pig ! ! ! One day meetg several poor Women going to his House he asked them where they were going -- They answered My Lady had ordered them to come for some Broth -- Broth Broth said the Niggard You shall have no Broth here -- Go about yr- busineſs -- ! ! A Gentn . in the Neighborhood went to dine wh- him -- there was no Hay or Corn for the horses & after dinner the Meat was put away & Nothing for the Servants upon this the Servants took the horses to Exeter & when they had fed both parties they returned in time to take their Master home . who wrote to Sir J . the next day that he should visit him any more -- The road turned short at the town of Topsham & we rode thro the town & had great difficulty to keep our horses the right side upermost & when we got out of this dreadful place we miſsed our way again -- We did at last get to Exmouth from whence there is the finest view of Sea & Land that can be imagined -- the Sea was covered with Small Craft & acroſs the River is seen Lord Lisburne 's fine place Mamhead & Powderham Castle -- the Wretch who belongs to it is said to be in America -- Saturday 1 OClock -- I must over all yesterday for this letter -- At 10 we went to the Cathedral -- as soon as the Bishop saw me he sent by one of the Choiristers for the Youth who was playing the Organ to come & join in Te Deum Laudamus composed by Jackson & afterwards he spoke to him previous to his singing an Anthem Soleas by Kent except the concluding Chorus -- I was perfectly enchanted with the Anthem -- his Voice is the finest I ever heard & the Organ is reckoned the grandest in Europe -- the pipes being 2 Inches in Diameter wider than the Organ at Ulm -- We staid after the Service to hear the beginning of the Rehearsal for Monday -- The Bishop came in & was very friendly asked me how I liked the Anthems I said I was delighted he tapped me on the Shoulder & said I shd . be ungrateful if I did not as he ordered it on purpose as soon as he saw me , I lamented that I could not hear the full Organ -- he instantly ordered it to be played & the Choir sung that noble Chorus of the Horse & his Rider & it was truly magnificent -- We are just setting out on our return & I am delighted wh . every thing I have seen & heard -- Adieu -- God bleſs you you must make this out as well as you can -- Present my dutiful Love to Ly Cecilia & Comps to Mr. Johnston Single Sheet To Mrs. Dickenson 32 Devonshire Place London
