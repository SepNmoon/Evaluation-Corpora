10 th . Octbr . 1779 Sunday Morng- My dearest , dearest , dearest , Sister , Friend , I have according to my promise sent you back yr . Letters this Morning , I have looked ym .. over & over again , the Letters I think are very affectionate & kind ones , & I find my sentiments so perfectly synonymous with to those contained in ye . Sonnet & Character yt . I fancy they must have been written by two persons whose hearts are very nearly in ye situation of mine . Cependant brisons ladeſsus , I shall however entreat of you to remind me of ye . name of Clementina , you told it me at W—— but it slipped out of my memory . But as for those of Clara , & of ye writers of ye . Sonnet , & Character , my prudence forbids my treſspaſsing too much upon yr . generosity , especially as you have placed such implicit confidence in me , indeed more than I deserved , however I hope you will never find it greatly misplaced . As for me , my Lady Mary Webb there is not a secret of my Soul , that I do not , that I have not disclosed to you , you have closely inspected my heart & my mind , & I hope you find neither of them bad . One paſsion I have which I forgot to mention before in my Portrait , & which I think you may place among my Vertues , that is my affection to a Friend , ( & to you most especially as ye . best of all my Friends , ) which would carry me such lengths , yt .. I wld .. lay down my life most willingly for their service . I am very sorry as Miss Ann Litchfield has such weight with you , yt .. she disapproves so much of ye . Character of Tom Jones , especially as I compared it to mine , I thought I was paying a compliment to myself in so doing , you must however confeſs that there is great openneſs , frankneſs , generosity , spirit & gratitude , strongly marked in his Character , yet I remember , when I made ye . comparison , & it stung me then , you was quite silent upon ye . subject , whereas I thought you wld .. have cought at it & with yr . usual frankneſs have either told me that my Character was better or worse than his , I cld .. not help thinking this very singular , however as I know you to be an odd unaccountable creature , it did not make much impreſsion upon me . I sent you ytday Evening some Paterns which I beg you will keep as long as you have a mind , before you give me yr . opinion of y.m .. you may return ym .. to me , either this E——g or T——w M——g or not till I return from W——r , when I promise you , you shall have an account of every thing yt . paſses at W——r during yr . absence , as well as of ye . Chace on Tu——y M——g , friendship as you say is always sympathetick , I shall probably go & seat myſelf in yr . Chair , & brood over ye . many happy hours I have spent there in conversation with you , & shall say to myself , what t is there now wanting to make you happy ? why my Miranda , without whom every thing to me is nothing . If you have any command s for , or any little thing to bring from W——r , tell me & I will execute yr . commiſsion . Adieu , Adieu , Adieu , dearest , dearest , dearest , Sister , friend , Mrs .. Carter , Whatever becomes of me , wherever I am , or wherever I go , you are never absent from ye thoughts of yr . ever sincerely affectionate Brother Miranda toujours de même P.S . Pray tell me how poor Miranda behaved in ye Coach & what sort of Company he was & what he said to you . Ad . Ad . Ad . toujours chére .
