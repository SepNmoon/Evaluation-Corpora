my Dear the Honble Wilhelmina Murray I can not leave the Town without sending you my best wishes , and a few regretts at the disapointment I feel at not having had the pleasure of seeing you this winter : but I will not repine at what was proper you say to do ; and you have always judged so well that I must say nothing more on the subject : but will hope that when we return , we shall be fortunate enough to meet , and have a little enjoyment of society -- the Town has realy been tipsey if I may so say ever since Mrs. Dickinson recovery : it has been continual balls riots and rejoicing : but it has been a great baulk to his Friends after the thanksgiving was over , not to see them as usual not one Levée has been : it has given a continuance to disagreable reports ; and they can not be avoided but by his apearance as usual -- I am sorry to say his friends say altho ' perfectly well , yet he is much weakened : his legs swell at night and he is very thin so that he is not looked upon to be in good health . this will acount for his not coming forward as usual but I think if he was to Stay but half an hour it would be a satisfaction and put an end to reports ... H. M . has had but two drawing rooms both very much crouded the first was atended with fits laughing & screaming : the loſs of trimmings ; Lappets and even trains -- the ladies that were to be presented lost their company 's and either were pushed before the Queen and obliged to present themselves or , never got the honor at all -- the last was better regulated a new door was opened next the Windows for company to go in at , the center was kept shut till H. M . came who was led to the middle table the Princeſses stood in a line to the upper end of the room so the company paſst one by one and turning under the Canopy went out at the door H. M . came in at : and being desired to go out , prevented any croud or pushing -- the Queen looked very well . she has since been at the play and opera , at the first she was recieved with such aclamations as overcame her and the Princeſses . at the latter there was a Hiſs that surprised every body but was not drowned without being noticed -- last night She gave a great Ball at Windsor the Queen and Lord were of the number the Ladies dreſs is the Windsor uniform dark blue Laby gown with very broad gold fringe down the sides which are drawn up about half way with two superb taſsels of gold the apron or petitcoat is white crape with two gold fringes by way of trimming narrow and a twist above the fringe of red & blue . the handkercheifs ruffles and caps are all uniform four white plumes in the latter . inshort the dreſs altogether is from 36 to forty pound -- a good round sum for a ball dreſs that must be wore -- this last fête has ocasioned great heart burning 's for while Lady King stopt with the peers daughters the Maids of Honor and commoners were out of the question , but having invited H. M . and Miſs Pulteney to this it has opened every body 's mouth and expectation as many think they had as good if not a better right to be asked . no doubt there was a reason but it ought to have been a very strong one to let in such a croud upon her hands -- you will hear of all this from better authority I imagine -- Miſs Copes is in town on Buſsineſs which all his friends are very anxious about its succeſs ; they have had a great shock which prevented his coming so soon as he returned post to the Dutcheſs from Edinbr . when on his way to London it was the sudden death of the Duke of Atholl , the youngest Boy who was a remarkable strong and fine child of his age , had been crowing in the Dutcheſs 's lap not five minutes before it was siezed with a fit which it never came out of -- the teeth was the ocasion -- I feel quite glad not to have seen it , but it was born at Blair just when we left the country so had no opportunity -- tomorrow we sett out , and intend to verifie the old adage that the farthest way about is the nearest way home as we go first to the Grange to visit Lord Frederick in our way to Bath , where we intend to visit Mr. Henry Drummond and Lady Jane who live there , as does Mr. Muirhead -- from thence we propose to go to Lady Charlotte Murray who is married & settled near Liverpool and after that visit shall sett our faces North and get home as fast as we can . My Sister will I hope quite establish her health ; in this tour and flatter myself we shall bring her back still better than we take her -- I likewise hope to return my Charge to Her Father in high health she is very much grown and I hope he will aprove , of the use she has made of her time and the expence he has been at for her improvement which has been very liberal he will think well bestowed . You will easily believe I shall be happy to see Him satisfied with it , as he placed such implicit confidence in us and now that she is his only Darling , it made me doubly anxious . in spight of Masters and amusements , she has found time for more serious & nesesary ap̄lication , having been confirmed and recieved the Sacrament . since which we have been to one Opera , Ranelagh , Sadlers , Wells , & Astleys , so that she will have a very good idea of what she will hear & read of in the papers , but the amusement I liked best was an Exhibition at Covent Garden Theatre in Lent by 4th Duke of Atholl , shewing the revolution of the Earth Moon & Stars with Comets Eclipses and the Causes of the Ebb & flow of the tides -- it was a moral entertainment , was atended by very full houses & a Silence that did them honor even to the Gallerys . but I find I am come to the end of my paper so must leave the Stars to aſsure My Dear Lord Henry Murray I am at all times her Sincere well wisher & Affectionate Friend Walker my Sister & Husband present you with their best compts add mine to theirs & make them acceptable to Mrs. Dickenson . I admire Wilhelmina Murray ' s anxiety & Loyalty . I hope she will continue her improvements of body & mind as they must make you and all so happy . I m ake no doubt she already manages Grand . papa & will very soon Papa & Mamma -- Gen : & Mr. Dickenson are in the country he has been under Surgeons hands three months with his wounded Leg breaking out again so is gone upon his crutches for change of air . she is very well + my Brother has just put his third & youngest son to Eton six year old the other two you know have been there a great while -- Addio V ' Auguro Ogni Bene -- + Miſs Louisa Mrs. Leland London may twenty 89 Lord King Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire
