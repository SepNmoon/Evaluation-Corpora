Wilton Lodge 13 th . Janry- 1797 . My Dear Sister , As a proof of my punctuality & dispatch , I now ( ¼ before twelve ) return the Poetry received from You at Ten O'Clock this Morning . The present state of Affairs keep Me , on the Alert , my Regiment having received orders to be in readineſs to move from Aberdeen , at a Moments warning . I have notified to Our Commander Lord Adam Gordon , that ( disdaining my Privilege of Parliament ) I am ready to join the Corps , whenever he may think my presence may be neceſsary . So , least the French , driven from Ireland , should come to forage in Scotland , and penetrate as far as this , I return your Valuable Manuscripts , to prevent the poſsibility of their falling into such unhallowed hands . As the post departs at One . I must write short . Tell Mr. Dickenson , that the Teviot , running past my Door , abounds with Par , Small Trout , sometimes Salmon , and now & then a few Sea Trout , find their way up . All these remain unmolested by Me , not having had a Fishing Rod in my hand above once , since I came to live here . That , I have one Pointer , two Greyhounds , & my Lady has a Spaniel , not one of which I ever go out with . But , if he strays this way , He may , if he thinks fit . Partridges & Hares are to be found , they tell me , at the Door , & Grouse , in the Neighbourhood . So much for sporting intelligence . Now , for domestic news , My Wife & eldest Daughter , well . My two younger Sons , & two Younger Daughters , Colded ( if you dont understand the Expression , apply to my Countrywoman . ) My eldest Son , supposed to be , well . My fat Uncle Patrick , confined with the Gout . Myself , in my Ordinar , ( apply again to Countrywoman ) , & doomed to paſs the forenoon in my Library , owing to an agreeable Sleet , from the Westward . I hope , this account is sufficiently in Detail , to please You . The 8 th - Vol . of Goldsmith 's Natural Histy- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and a Vixen . Happy will that Man be , whose fate may join him to so much Wisdom . Commend me to Louisa . Being an ignorant Blockhead myself , I hate every thing that savours of too much Learning , and would rather see , a Child of the Age of Ly . Caroline running about , laying in a Stock of health , than hear one enter into scientific conversations . So Adieu . Commend me most Graciously to your Husband ; Give Louisa , a Kiſs ; and say every thing civil to my Countrywoman . My Rib joins me in best wishes & c. & c. & c Ever My Dear Sister Your Affectionate Brothe r & faithful Friend Napier . Hawick , Thirteenth Janry- 1797 Mrs- Dickenson Birch Hall HAWICK Napier .
