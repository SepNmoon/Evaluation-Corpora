Caroline Park Jany 7 th 1774 . I will not ſay My dearest Mary how happy yours made me yesterday on my arrival here having been viſiting about the Country for ſome time and my letters were ſent home I can only ſay that you have made both Lady Napier & I extremely happy as we were frighted out of our witts on yr last but thank God be are quit for the fear tho I am glad you opened to yr Mama as those things are best not to be a secret tho you misunderstood my letter as I meant that Young Lady 's shd- not carry on those things without the knowledge of Parents yet I do not think its absolutely neceſsary to tell of those they refuse as in that case there can be but little danger of their happineſs , its the carrying on an affair wtout the knowledge of Parents that I meant , not the refusing disagreeable People , but with proper Parents even that is wrong as they never will force th e inclinations of their Children . I do beg to hear ſoon from you and with your uſual frankneſs otherwise I shall think you have given up your Guardian for being so much attached to your interest as even to ſeem to be angry with you indeed My dearest Girl I was not , tho I was most senſibly concerned as I was afraid you had been engaged in ſome affair you was unwilling to let your sincere friends know off or that you had been prevailed upon to keep Secret Adieu My Amiable Ward may God bliſs you & send you many returns of this seaſon and may Yr Mama have the comfort of seeing you rewarded with every good thing to make you happy that we wish & then I am ſure none can be more so -- remember us to Mrs- Hamilton in the best way & aſsure her of our best wishes , write soon and forgive any expreſsion I may have made use of in my last & place it to my anxiety for your happyneſs . Adieu My dearest Mary believe me Your best & affct Friend Napier To Miſs Hamilton near Northampton T . A . C .
