My dearest dearest dearest Friend , How happy should I have been if we had had the pleasure of yr . Company at Windsor . I think then the Quizz 's would have ſtood no chance of escaping notice , there were but two during the whole of our ſtay that attracted the attention of ye . whole of our Company the one was a little Original of a French Painter about as high as my Elbow , and the other was Mrs .. Bludworth , a more disagreeable , prim , ſtiff Creature I never saw . I look upon myself as very unfortunate for I underſtand that you go either tomorrow Evening or Sunday Evening , with Adolphus , Mary , & Sophia , & return with their Majesties on the usual day . I mean Wednesday , & ( I tell you this as a grand secret ) that a little Bird has whispered me , that the two parts of the Family are to travel , thus alternately Week and Week about during the whole Summer , except when the whole will be reunited for ye Birthdays . By this means I ſhall not have so frequently as I could desire , that heartfelt satisfaction of seeing you and conversing with you , of telling you all that paſses in my mind , and in ſhort of disburdening my whole Soul before you . I am sorry that I am obliged to break off so abruptly in my Letter , but I have really not an instant of time more , I am very much grieved that I so far hurt yr . delicacy in offering you that little Smelling Bottle , which I thought when I sent it you upon the footing of a nosegay you would have accepted of , as each of ye other Ladies had had one , but I give you my honor it never shall happen again . Adieu & believe me ever to be yr . sincere admirer & affectionate Friend . P.S . pray be quite secret concerning every thing I write about Windsor . Adieu .
