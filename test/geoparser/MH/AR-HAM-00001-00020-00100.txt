Kinsale , 5 th . Febry- 1787 . My Dear Sir , Maria & I very heartily rejoice with you on My Dear Sister 's safety & the birth of your Daughter , & sincerely pray that they may both be long preserved to You . We shall be impatient 'till we hear how Nursing agrees with Mrs- D . I am confident she will be the better for making the attempt , and I hope that she will succeed . Maria tried it with her first Child but to her very great mortification She was obliged to relinquish the office . Mrs- D . must guard against being too anxious . I beg you will tell her , that it is my advice to her to give up all management of her daughter to You . If she does not , the Child will grow as saucy as herself , and be as much detested by everybody as she is . As to your intended Challenge , I should humbly be of opinion it would be most prudent for You to drop the idea . If my proofs of your Jerryism were before defective , your letter has furnished me with incontestable evidence of the truth of my aſsertion . In the first place You allow that your Wife 's letters are sacred & that she only communicates what paragraphs she pleases . Is not this Jerryism ? Secondly , Your Wife has forced & commanded You to copy her handwriting , in which you have made such progreſs , that I can hardly bring myself to believe that the John Dickenson in your letter was not written by Mary Dickenson . If you do not now confeſs yourself to to be a Jerry , I can only conclude you to be the most obstinate of the Jeremiah tribe & leave You to chaunt your own Lamentations on the subject , 'till they at length get the better of your high Spirits & reduce you to the situation of a tame Sparrow to hop about the house at Spousy 's call . I am glad to hear the Bath waters have had the effect you expected from them . I have never yet made trial of them , tho ' I have been bilious from my earliest years . Since I have been quartered here , an old Lady gave me a very simple recipe which I have found great benefit from viz . Half an ounce of the best Aloes , & the same quantity of Castile Soap . Pound them separately , then pound them well together and make the maſs into Pills . One , two or three to be taken at Bed time . I began with one & have never taken more than two at a time . Whenever I feel myself heated and costive , I take my Pill which in the morning operates . The orders for our Embarkation are at length arrived . Colonel Ogilvie goes to Canada with the Regt- so that I hope to be in Britain in the Month of July . My Lawsuit will I fear detain me till that time in this Country , much against my inclination for I have long been tired of living in this very unsettled Country Kingdom -- Maria joins me in every affectionate wish to You & Yours . Ever My Dear Sir Yours very faithfully Napier . John Dickenson Esqr . N o 2 Abbey Street KINSALE Lord Napier Febry 1787
