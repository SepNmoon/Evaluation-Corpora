71 , Queen Street 17 th - Octr- 1806 My Dear Sister , I have just received your Letter of the 11 th . Instant . Before I take any notice of the contents of it , I must inform You of a recent melancholy Event , which is uppermost in my Thoughts . It has pleased God to deprive us of my Sister Hunter . She died on the 9 th - of this Month . Her health , for many Years , was much impaired , and during the whole of this Summer she had suffered sev erely , at times , from violent pains in her Stomach attended with reachings and vomitings . She returned from the Doctor s house in Dumfries Shire , about 70 miles from hence on the third Inst- , and did not feel so tired as she expected to have been . Though looking thinner than when I had seen her last , yet she was cheerful ; but , on the Monday after her arrival , the pains in her Stomach returned . Still no danger was apprehended . On the Wednesday evening , the Surgeon , who has attended our family for upwards of Thirty Years , was with her at eight O'Clock , At that time no change in her pulse indicated an approaching diſsolution , and he left her with no apprehensions of any immediate danger . During the Night she was extremely unwell , and a visible alteration in her countenance alarmed her Maid , who called up the Doctor of the family between five & six on The Thursday Morning . The Surgeon was sent for ; but , before his arrival , my poor Sister had breathed her last , in so gentle a manner , that the precise moment of her death was not known . Her excellent Husband was praying by her Bed side , and was stopped by perceiving her Eyes fixed & herself motionleſs . She did not say anything from which we can collect whether she was sensible of her approaching end , except the day she returned to Edinburgh , when , on the Doctor 's congratulating her , on having made out her journey well , she replied , “ Indeed Doctor , I never expected to have “ been here again . ” She has left two Sons , & two Daughters . The eldest Daughter , is twenty two , & the eldest Son just come of Age . Dr. Hunter is a most sincere Christian . His pious and resigned Conduct , on this occasion , has set an excellent example to us all , and taught us how we ought to receive the mournful dispensations of Providence . At any other moment than this , I should have been apt to have expreſsed myself rather sharply , on the subject of old Mr. D . s conduct relative to Mrs- Skinner . It was surely cruel to employ me to make such enquiries as were likely to raise the hopes of this unfortunate Woman , and then to take no notice of her . It was using both her , & me ill . I know of no situation in a public Charity here , into which she can be admitted . In the Poor House , where She is , she receives such support , as may preserve Life , but , certainly , without comforts or conveniences . I shall make no observation further on the subject , except to add , that five Guineas annually , would be a great aſsistance to the Poor Woman . Our Cousins behave very properly to us . He has shewn much affection & feeling , at this time . It is a pity that he can not lay aside being fine , which would make him much more agreeable in general . Maria & my family are well . Adieu My Dear Sister . With most sincere affection for Your & Yours , I ever am , Your faithful Friend & Brother Napier Edinburgh , Seventeenth October 1806 Mrs- Dickenson Leighton House Leighton Buzzard Beds Napier .
