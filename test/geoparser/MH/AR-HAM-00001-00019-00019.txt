Canterbury Sept . 5 th 1772 Well said My Dear Young Moralizing Philosopher , its certainly a very hard knowledge to know oneself and as you say , we ought most certainly to dedicate all our time in pursuit of that knowledge , Yet alas even tho we do , its seldom , or indeed ever acquired . Vanity not only hides our faults from us , but often makes us believe we perfectly know ourselves , which Belief runs us into more folly 's then any thing I know off -- However if I know the least of myself I think I may venture to aſsure My dearest Miſs Hamilton how very much obliged I am to her for the Purse which shall be my constant companion till wore out , & when that happens , I make no doubt my impudence may deſire another , as least I think its what you may expect from your Goodneſs to me , the old proverb ſays give ſome Peop le an inch they 'll take an Ell -- tho I am not very well pleased that you deſire me always to wear it in my Pocket that it may not ſuffer me to forget you . Is that a kind saying from My dear Daughter ? I 'll refer that to your self and I expect that you will anſwer my question in your next -- Your Minds Eye is likeways out for your letter was neither twirled round & casted from me with the Pish & c & c & c But received & read with the Great eſt pleasure imaginable with a , what a good Girl this is to be so indulging as write so often to me , but I could only wish she would make her favors still greater , that is to ſay her letters longer . I am happy you like Mrs- Carter s Poems it flatters my vanity not a little to find my opinion is supported by one I have so great a respect for her Judgement but I 'll say no more as you 'll call it flattery which is a Crime I never was accuſed off before , & yet three parts of my last letter was not worth the answering because made up of nothing else so your Ladyship is pleased to ſay , I wish it was in my power to abuse you for your foibles , did I know of any you had be aſsured you should hear of them in every letter I wrote you . were we to live much longer than the old Man in the Bible together , & correspond the whole time , you See I am very angry and if I did not expect an excuse in Your other sheet that you promise for what you ſaid , I would punish you by writing another sheet but to shew you upon pardon being ask 'd , it likeways can be granted I beg my best respects to Mrs Hamilton & My dearest Mary May believe me to be her most unalterable friend WmNapier
