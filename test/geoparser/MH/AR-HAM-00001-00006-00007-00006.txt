My Dear Miſs Hamilton Mrs Montagu has got a great cold else your invitation for Monday would tempt her to break thro ' her general rule of never going out of a Morning . if I can contrive to get out on Monday I shall certainly have the pleasure of waiting on you but I dare hardly promise for the Coach Man is at present ill & it is more than probable that as the influenza has got among the servants there will not be one well enough to attend me -- but I will come if I can -- yours sincerely D—— Gregory Miſs Hamilton
