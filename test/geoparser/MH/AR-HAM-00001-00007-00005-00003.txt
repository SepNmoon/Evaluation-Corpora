Burley Decr . 6 th . 1777 My dear Miſs Hamilton Though Ht . has talked of writing this post , & indeed began her Letter , yet it has so often happened to her to fail of having it ready that I am determined not to put off telling you by this , that my Mother arrived well & happily on Thursday Morning , & has found as you will believe a very joyful Houſe . I have commiſsioned Ht . to enclose a Little Drawing that I have been attempting in Water Colours & Chalk from some of the Tapestry here . it is really not worth yr . acceptance , but I thought the size wd . suit your little book , however as little valuable as it is , my Mother thinks it wd . be entirely spoiled in going by the Post , so I will hope to bring it you myself in a few Weeks , when I flatter myself we shall have some comfortable meetings at S t . James 's -- I have been long charged with many kind Meſsages on this Subject from Mrs. Carter , who promises not to think you too young if you will not think her too old -- my time will never allow of making you proper Compliments of Congratulation , & now Condolence on Publick & Private Events but I must employ so much of it as I can in begging More kindest Compts . to Mrs. Hamilton & dear Miſs G , & that you will accept of them from all at Burley & particularly of from yr . own Child who has now learnt to say Yes , so I shall certainly ask her if she loves Miſs Hamilton . I am now got on a dangerous subject for a person in haste so I will really quit it at once & only aſsure you that I am ever most sincerely & faithfully Yrs . Sophia Feilding
