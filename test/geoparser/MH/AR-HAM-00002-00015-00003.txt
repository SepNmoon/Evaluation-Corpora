It is not neceſsary for me to tell You all I felt & thought when we parted last Night -- could I have wept I should have been releived but it was not till I sat alone in my breakfast Room this Morng that the friendly aid of tears easd in some degree the oppreſsion of my heart -- I check 'd every melancholy presage whilst I saw You , but when I knew You were hastening on Your Road from me all thoughts of future happineſs seem 'd to abandon me . I have been taking myself severely to task -- but will not erase what I have written -- shall I ever hide a thought from You ? -- shall I ever be guilty of making You believe me more worthy of Your approbation than I really am ? No No You shall see my heart as through a transparent Mirror . The dear Sister was obliged to leave me for ye whole day She went to ye Wifes house to see the Widowd Sister -- I denied myself to every one & sat alone till dinner time , I read , I wrote , I work 'd & made it a duty to employ myself & keep my up my spirits The perverse one & I din 'd tête á tête , who left me immediately after dinner -- a letter from the Good Dowager cheer 'd my spirits in some degree , I will tell You what she said , at least so far as will in- interest You -- The Ducheſs & Ducheſs of Portland call 'd Mrs Delany always ye .

We dont doubt Yo . had a merry Xmaſs & “ Return Yor . kind wishes wth . great warmth -- the Friend says that ( 2 “ must be very acceptable , it is sufficient to have ye word “ warmth in it ; We dont know wht Your fashions are in London “ but ours are three Handkerchiefs ; four Cloaks , hoods to the “ tip of our Nose , besides Spectacles .

King of Poland “ to whom I beg You will make my Compts acceptable -- ” I recd . also a letter from my Brother from Ireland , a very saucy one -- You shall judge for when I can get frank I will enclose it . In the afternoon A Meſsage from ye . Fairy to inform me that The D.D.P . the Mrs Delany & Baroneſs & Pieta ( whom for ye . future we will call Baron were at her house , they were attractions not to be resisted , I put on as cheerful a countenance as I could aſsume & went -- I was made happy by seeing my beloved friend Mrs Montagu & the Baroneſs delighted me by saying many kind things of You -- as to the Fairy she fairly own 'd a paſsion for You . -- Attica -- ye verse writer ) came in for an hour -- he is a civil , fair looking good sort of a Man -- I think a Cap wd . become him vastly -- for ye . future we will call him Pieta , I will not tell You all I heard this Eveg . as it was not very interesting tho ' as conversation tolerably amusing . I came home at ten o'Clock -- the eldest was gone to her room ( I hate ye . name perverse we will drop it ) I scribbled a folio to ye . good Mrs. Carter of A letter from the friend agreeably surprised me before I went to my Room her Servt . brought it from her house where it was sent . You know I beleive that she can now only dictate her letters & yt . her Maid writes them -- I will transcribe it . “ Happy as I am wth . ye . kind remembrances I “ have recd . from You , made doubly precious to me by “ being united wth . those of our Dear & inestimabl y e friend “ Lady Dartrey must speak a word or two for herself -- most “ sensibly have I miſs 'd my amiable Morning companion , “ my works have gone on slow & sad -- till ye . enlivening hour of “ a summons to ye .

Baron s -- the American Gentleman whom you saw , & whose Story the Baroneſs told You , din 'd there also wth . his Wife & 3 of their Children -- a Nephew of Mr Dickenson s also who spends his Hol l idays at his Uncle s -- a fine Youth very amiable engaging -- The Baroneſs said she had been thinking of You & hoped You wd . get safe home -- she recd . a letter from Mirander -- wch . informd her King of Poland was better & Pliny was return 'd to her , so he did not chuse to come to us in London tho ' he was but 14 Miles off -- they are to leave Norfolk in a few days for Courteen Hall -- At 7 -- good Dowager , Baroneſs , Dſs . of Portland , Nephew & me got into ye .

I tell You once for all my friend that You must either be very attentive to these kind of requests of mine , or I must learn to grow more indifferent about You . I forgot to mention that I had a long Visit from the Priest this Morng . he came to consult me abt . his Son whom he is going to remove from ye . place where he is for his education -- we had a long conversation & he descided in favor of what I proposed -- I will not torment You with all this -- He was particular in his enquiries after You & expreſs 'd much solicitude abt . Your getting safe to Your Journeys end . Ly Dartrey went early to her Room -- & wd . You believe it the Sister seduced me to sit up till ½ past 12 -- I aſsured her I would inform You how well she remember 'd all You had said to her upon this Subject . Decbr .. 29 th .. 84 . The Sister again left me to spend the day at The Prince of Wales s House . The Mother in Law to my Brothers Wife ( ye .

The Eldest & I din 'd tête á tête she left me immediately after dinner , I return 'd to my writing & was agreeably interrupted by a Letter from You , forgive me my Dearest friend for what I said in ye . begin̅ing of this page -- What a comfortleſs Journey have You had , yet 6 ) I thank God that You have met wth . no accident I hope I shall have ye . Joy & comfort of hearing You have got safe to ye . end of it . I am glad You did , & much obliged to you for calling upon ye . Baron she has always been so kind & good to me that I wish to shew her every attention in my power . I have spent this afte r noon alone , I can say as the Friend does in one of her letters wch . I have been reading , “ that as well as I love society a day sometimes entirely to oneself is very pleasant , & I wonder at people who think it a melancholy thing to spend a day alone , 't is like a pause in music wch when properly introduced gives a grace to the whole piece ” Apropos as to Music I intreat yt . You will cultivate it as much as poſsible -- You know how I delight in Harmony & I am certain Your Ear is too nice to endure discordant sounds therefore I am persuaded You will arrive at perfection -- if You think there is in this “ more meant than meets ye . “ Ear ” perhaps You are not mistaken . Women it is said love to deal in Riddles -- What dreadful Weather for You to travel in -- I almost hate to feel the warmth from of a good fire when I reflect that You are shivering in the open air -- when I have ye . Joy of hearing You are got safe home & that you are not ye . worse for Your journey how light will my spirits be to what they are now -- remember remember what consequence Your health & life are to me & that the greatest proof You can give me of Your affection is being careful of yourself . for , “ How trifling are all worldly concerns compared with ye . life of a beloved friend ” ! The Sister came home at ½ past 9 but she went away again to join the Eldest at ye . Fairys where we were had been invited -- I excused Myself -- I did not forget your request I laid down my pen & went soberly to my Room ½ past 11 before they came home -- detirmined that I wd- shame ye . Snow-ball a pretty Monitor indeed You chose to enforce Your precepts ! Here am I finely abused I have been allowed to read what has been said against me I believe saucy dear Miſs thinks the Sister can not make any defence , but I would have her remember that People do not boast except when the thing is uncommon I mean her early hours . if Brothers will set examples & friends will be agreeable am I to be blamed ? I am impatient to hear that your Journey is finished & I have only space to add that I am your affectionate friend & Sister ( 7 I stole a bit of this Paper to tell you what short memories people have sometimes a Lady in C Street wrote a Letter to a Lady at —— & as it was by the Penny Post she directed it under Cover to the Viscount Times have altered when exact & punctual people are inattentive !

I beg that You will not fail to present my every Affectionate love to Your Sisters and also that You will aſsure Your Father that I both respect & esteem him . I heard from ye . Baron ye . other day that there was a Wild Man very lately seen in Kent -- the severity of ye . Weather drove him from the Woods -- he is quite in a Savage State & has no language but makes a barbarous noise -- he was not taken but and fled away again -- You may depend upon the truth of this . I was to have spent this Morng . with Dear Pieta , but a heavy fog & thaw makes me afraid to to to take cold & I dare not venture to walk even so short a distance -- I have promised You to be careful of my health & You never shall have reason to reproach me with failing in my promises . You can not imagine how mortified Mrs Sandford was to miſs seeing You -- if I had known she was to have come on Monday I would have requested You to put off Your journey till Tuesday . It is now 12 at Noon & so dark that tho ' I am close to ye .

God grant You are not on Horseback in such a Mist . I have heard so great a Character of Sr. Toby Fret s letters that I beg You will try to borrow them , they we a re lately published . Mrs. S said that he gave very different advice to his Son to what Mrs S—— had done to his -- My Uncle Frederick says , You must endeavour to be a Man of principle & Virtue -- & c & c & The Eldest recommends the appearance of what is right to conceal & aid what is wrong -- I have just had a visit from ye .

Eveg -- she is a very old & great friend of the two worthy ones as I thought they might wish to have some private converse & as Anna Maria Clarke was gone I slip 'd away & sat in another Room for an hour -- they gave me great credit for this attention -- more than it deserved for I only did as I should like to be done by -- You know what an avowed ene n my I am to all restraint I came home at ½ past 9 -- Miranda Coach -- the Eldest went to her room before ten -- Anne & I sat & talk 'd , ( of You chiefly ) till near 12 .

I like Mrs Delany he is as worthy a Man as Sr Toby ( I will call him M r D . for ye . future ( for the other ) & more lively -- I do not believe he is quite so well inform 'd or has read so much -- but he is a sensible Man . tho ' this was his first Visit he conversed wth . me as with an old friend -- he won my heart by talking of his little Daughter a sweet Child of 6 Years of age -- You know 10 ) I believe , that this poor Mans heart has recd . a wound no time can heal -- You heard of his having lost a beautiful & most amiable Wife -- he has also a little boy abt . 5 Years old . I really thought he intended spending ye . day with me & when at last he rose to take his leave he made me this polite apology for ye leng ht th of his visit -- that 't was my own fault & c The Sister has again left me to spend the day at ye .

Streets are perfectly clean -- but tho ' I do not go to Church do not imagine I neglect ye . duties of the day . -- If I remember right You told me You had not read any of the dear Friend s Sermons it is therefore allowable for me to transcribe a few paſsages from one of them I have read this Morng . it pleased me & as I flatter myself our opinions & tastes are similiar -- You will approve of what he says on ye . Subject of ye . Union of Piety & Morality -- “ The neglect of Piety argues depravity “ of heart ; & it infers an irregular discharge of ye . duties “ of morality ” -- It argues internal depravity for it discovers a “ cold & a hard heart . if there be any impreſsion wch . man is “ formed by Nature to receive , it is a sense of religion . As “ soon as his Mind opens to observation & reflection , he “ discerns innumerable marks of his dependant state . He “ finds himself placed by some superior power , in a vast “ world , where ye . wisdom & goodneſs of ye . Creator are “ conspicous on every side , The magnificence , the beauty & order “ of nature excite him to admire & adore . When he looks “ up to that invisible hand wch . operates throughout the “ Universe , he is impreſsed wth . reverence , when he receives “ bleſsings wch . he can not avoid ascribing to divine goodneſs “ he is prompted to gratitude . The expreſsions of those “ forms affections under the various forms of divine “ religious worship , are no other than native effusions of ye . “ human heart . Ignorance may mislead , & superstition “ may corrupt them ; but their origin is derived from “ sentiments that are eſsential to Man . -- Whatever “ either from reverence or from gratitude can excite Men “ to ye . worship of God is by the Christian Revelation placed “ in such a light , as one shld . think were sufficient to “ overawe ye . most thoughtleſs , & to melt the most “ obdurate mind . -- Where religion is neglected , there can be “ no regular nor steady practice of ye . duties of morality , the “ character will be inconsistent , & Virtue placed on a basis “ too narrow to support it will be always loose & tottering . For “ such is ye . propensity of our Nature to Vice , so numerous are 14/ “ are the temptations to a relaxed & immoral conduct , “ that stronger restraints than those of mere reason are “ necessary to be imposed on Man . The sense of right & wrong , the “ principle of honor , or ye . instinct of benevolence , are “ barriers too feeble to withstand ye . strength of paſsion . “ In the tranquil Seas Seasons of life , these natural “ principals may , perhaps , carry on ye . ordinary course of social “ duties with some regularity . But wait till some “ trying emergence come . Let the conflict of the paſsions “ arise . Let the heart be either wounded by sore “ distreſs , or agitated by violent emotions ; & You shall “ presently see that virtue without religion is “ inadequate to the government of Life . It is destitute “ of its proper guard , of its firmest support , of its “ chief encouragement . It will sink under ye . weight “ of misfortune ; or will yield to the solicitation of “ guilt -- The great motives that produce constancy & “ firmneſs of action , must be of a palpable & striking “ kind . A divine Legislator , uttering his voice from “ Heaven ; An Omniscient witneſs , beholding us in “ all our retreats ; An Almighty Governour stretching “ forth his arm to punish or reward , disclosing the “ secrets of the invisible world , informing us of “ perpetual rest prepared hereafter for ye . righteous , & of “ indignation & wrath awaiting ye . wicked , These are “ the considerations wch . overawe ye . world , wch . support “ integrity , & check guilt .

Mrs Walsingham s ( Pieta s Sister ) hands near 3 hours what a waste of time ! -- however I always read so I need not say that -- She has been putting my hair into fashionable order -- cutting , curling , & dreſsing it , what triffles I write to you upon _ but 't is an old saying that every thing relating to those we love is interesting so You see I take it for granted -- You may finish the sentence if You please -- A Note from ye . Dear friend to invite me for tomorrow & to tell me she is better . Mrs Carter call 'd to invite me for ye . 5 th 't is ye . Baroneſs 's Birth day & I always dine there . The Dear Sister is again gone to spend ye . day at ye . Wife s House .

I really think it quite “ shameful -- ” I sincerely return your good wishes upon ye . “ beginning of a new Year , & hope that ye . present uncomfortable situation “ You are in , will be amply made amends for by this time next “ Year . I can imagine Mrs. Delany being exceſsively vext , but I “ hope he will consider , that those of Your friends who now “ are acquainted with him , will protect him , & not allow “ that this delay is any way occasioned by him -- it is so “ natural a thing for old people ( & indeed there are instances “ of it in Young as well as old ) to like there own way , that except “ ye . disappointment of having an Event delay 'd from wch . he “ expects so much happineſs -- he ought to be quite at ease . I “ beg You will tell him this , & as it natural Your near “ Relations shd . often be question 'd ( I am very often ) I shall “ take care that no suspicion shall fall upon him , or any “ thing unpleasant wth . regard to his Father hinted at . -- I wish You all ye . happineſs You have not now “ added to all you have , & that both may continue encreasing “ through many many Years & c -- I went to ye .

Irish Manufactors & c & c. there was much pleasant conversation -- the Fairy wd . not suffer me to leave them after ye . Company went , so I staid supper & did not get home till 12 . -- we drank Your health & the Fairy her Husband & Lord Napier said many kind things abt . You . 18 ) Tuesday Morng . / Ah how unlucky my foolish pate was dreſsing & so I miſs 'd seeing my Love Our Widows & a half love his Brother Mrs Garrick -- Alas ! Perhaps I may have lost Clasic Verses in my Praise wch . wd . might have charm 'd posterity -- I shall be very angry if You do not read the compositions of my friends -- so please to borrow -- Miſs H More on ye . Genius & writings of Mr D—— -- Mrs G.arrick , on English Poetry -- & in Dodsleys Collection of English Poetry there are many things written by ye . two Brothers .

Adventurer they are mark 'd with ye . letter Z . -- I have been writing ye . name wth . an H . it ought to be Warton Mrs. Carter also Translated Virgil -- & I suppose They have written many things I am not acquainted with . I had a Visit from good Pliny -- she call 'd to take me to ye . friend s but as I was to see her In the Eveg I did not go . -- H.M . paid me a long Visit she is a very sensible , agreeable , pretty Woman Some time or other I will talk more about her -- The Lady too came to see me -- she staid a good while & when she left me paid me the Compt . of saying -- how difficult it was to quit me -- She made me promise her three day 's -- Thursday -- Sunday & Monday next I have been busy cleaning & hanging up my Dr. Wharton s Picture , I have had it placed where the Print of ye Royal Children was -- & that I have hung over ye . door going in to my Boudoir -- my two little Rooms are now in perfect order & every thing is again tidy & comfortable , I also employ myself wth- regularity & I hope to my own profit -- I read -- work -- draw -- & write from ye . time I have breakfasted till dinner time -- at intervals I scribble to you & my other , absent friends ; as I wish to occupy my Mind as much as I can I shall begin to learn Italian -- but as I can not afford to have a Master , I shall make slow progreſs I fear . The Dear Sister came & sat wth- me ½ an hour before dinner -- we had not met since Yesterday Morng . for since You went I have not 19 ) breakfasted below Stairs . The amiable Baroneſs call 'd to remind me of tomorrow Tuesday ½ past 5 . -- The dining Room -- Mar all has left us as usual -- ye . Dr . Sister & I are both writing -- can not You or rather do you not sometimes transport Yourself in idea to us ? -- I am just now fancying that you are sitting with us -- this difference only excepted I can now write without interruptions -- As I live I believe You have engaged a Sylph in Your service & the little invisible spirit I suppose seeing the characters my pen had just traced was detirmin 'd to prove that no distance could secure me from being interrupted by You for I had just finished that word when ye . Post-mans knock made me start & in a moment a letter from You was put into my hands -- I will reply to it immediately . In the first place I must tell You that I rejoice to hear that You are not ye . worse for Your journey & that You are safe at The King s -- Your letter is dated Sunday ye . 2 d . of Jany & You tell me that You got to Elvaston on Wednesday ye . 29 th . Decbr . at 12 o'Clock -- perhaps I am in ye . wrong -- & You may think I am unreasonable well I wont say what You might have done -- I will only say for myself -- that I never in my life even when I had not ye . command of a moment in ye . day but that I found when friendship & affection had claims upon me that I could steal either an early or late hour from my repose to satisfy them -- Busineſs may occupy us -- engagements of various kinds it may be necessary for us to fulfill -- but even a first Minister of State will find one ½ Hour in ye 24 to devote to friendship -- I should have been satisfied with five Minutes had You bestowed them upon me last Wednesday . I believe that I poſseſs Your affection & that You love me entirely -- how comes it then that Your heart should be at ease & Your mind at rest when You must know that I am suffering the torture 20 of suspence , put Yourself in my place for a moment & then judge how anxious I was till I heard of Your safety . forgive me this reproach -- I must from my heart -- & I I become indifferent abt You . Your little Sylph snatch 'd the pen out of my hand “ & said , or seem 'd to say ” Alexander Pope , The Rape of the Lock , Canto 1 , l.26 remember how often Lord Bute has told You that it gives him pain to see You look grave & that smiles become You best -- the gloom that overspread my countenance vanished in an instant -- the Sylph to reward me placed Your image before me , this ideal view of You composed my spirits & I resumed my pen . I did not desire You to ask The Lady to be one of my admirers -- had he become one indeed I should have been pleased because You think him worthy of Your friendship & deserving of Your esteem , however upon any terms I shall be glad to place a friend of Yours upon the list & for Your sake I will overlook the humiliation -- for is it consistent wth . that proper pride wch . a female ought to have to solicit admiration ? -- After having endeavoured to raise my opinion of Your friend s character You most imprudently reveal that his Heart is narrow & selfish , -- does a benevolent one ever enquire whether ye . Object of there charity shall return the alms they give ? or does a generous Man expect more than thanks & gratitude to reward him for his liberality ? You will stare perhaps at all of this -- but I have it under Your own hand that Anna Maria Clarke declared he wd . not give my poor Milkwoman a Crown if I did not send him a large Collection of Sermons to save him the trouble of writing them -- nay more he expects them to be y e production of my Brain . what an unconscionable creature ! -- & how inconsiderate are You to expose Your Friend thus ! If You continue to desire me to send him some Sermons I shall make my bargain , viz that they shall take an Hour in the delivery & ye “ lapping up shall be a full ½ hour more . ( 21 Tuesday 4 th Janry . 85 continued . The good Dowgrs . Coach came for me at 7 & I went to ye . friends house -- I did not find the Dr- Friend so much recovered as I had flattered myself she was she is nevertheleſs much better & was in chearful spirits we had a quarter of an hours tête á tête , she told me yt . she had had ye . satisfaction of receiving a few lines from her Niece -- who has inform 'd her that she is better -- I was obliged to listen to praises wch . this unworthy woman does not merit -- God grant The dear Friend may never be undeceived -- for w h ere she even to know that she had been suspected of doing what is wrong I am certain it wld- kill her . I hope You will have no reason to repent having employed the Husband -- who is as worthleſs a being as the Wife . The good Dowgr . The Friend & I were just enter 'd into interesting conversation ( did not Your cheek burn ? ) when Miranda came -- & there I left her at ½ past 9 ( wch . is ye . hour I always quit ye . friend s house -- I believe ye . trio were equally chagrined at the interruption -- but to do my Cousin justice she was in a very agreeable mood .

There was a small friendly party at ye . Baron s , viz ye . Dear Friend Mrs. Newton Bishop of Bristol & Mrs Carter ( his Son ) hereafter I will speak of them , Pieta , his Tutor , and Mrs N—— -- this day my most dear & amiable friend the Baroneſs is 44 Years of age & I had the happineſs of hearing her say , she felt as if 22 ) she was only in her 20 th . Year -- there are few like her -- Virtue ought to pray for a long life for such as promote inculcate her precepts . I wish 'd for You my friend ! surely if the Guardian was perfectly acquai n ted wth . the characters of those I wish You to be intimate with his parental cares for Your future happineſs would have prevented his writing that fatal letter wch . has so cruelly dwelt upon my Mind . I refer to one paſsage only where he said “ Your expectations of happineſs will be disappointed & c ” -- I came home , wth . good old Mrs. N . for my Chaperon in the Baron s Coach abt . 11 -- I found ye .

I am well convinced that every disappointment we meet wth- in this world is if we properly discharge our great duties intended as a bleſsing ” wth . this comfortable Idea I bid You Adieu for to night -- May God of his infinite mercy protect us both & if it is his will that we should paſs any part of our lives together May we so live to his Glory here that we may be united in ye . world to come Friday 7 th .

I had a preſsing meſsage from Mr. D . & Lady Clermont to go to them this Eveg . but I had promised myself to others -- I was not in a mood for going out but as I was to be alone all day if I staid at home & as I find I must not be trusted by myself ( for I confeſs that I can not of late I have not been able to keep my spirits in any degree of command ) I am resolved to live as much in society as poſsible -- besides too as my society is so very select , & of ye . very first Claſs as to conversation & Characters I will can profit more by living wth . them than occupying myself at home & besides this , I can please myself wth . thinking that the more information I can get & the greater scope for observation for observation of Characters & Minds -- the more agreeable will my conversation be render 'd to you hereafter .

Mr. L—— was Bishop of Rochester & You may see an account of him & his writings in ye . Biographical Dictionary / Octo , / he was an elegant writer -- perhaps all this You know better than myself -- but as I had heard these letters spoke of as something newly come out I was led to recommend them to your notice 30 ) I can not pretend to relate all I heard from this Morng .

I have paſs 'd a sleepleſs night my beloved & dearest friend but I am not ye . worse for it -- I have gain 'd by it a proper command over my weakneſs 's & I can now write in reply to Yours wth . calmneſs & recollection . I thank God that You arrived safe at home & have not suffered in Your health by a trying Winter Journey . In answer to the material part of Your letter -- I intreat You will pay attention to what I am going to say -- let me advise You not to endeavour to find out this cruel secret disturber of Your happineſs -- it is sufficient for You to know that You have one to be guarded against them -- It is I know difficult to regain a Confidence however undeservedly lost & when people advanced in life once allow themselves to imagine we have interested views it is not an easy matter to undeceive them , the only method I would adopt in the present instance wd . be , to aſsure the Guardian that You wish not to be independant of him & wth . truth You may aſsure him that I shall be satisfied wth . whatever method he chuses to provide for us -- that we shall be perfectly content to rely on his generosity & wish to let him to continue the Master of his property -- convince him my Dear Dear Cooper that neither You nor Your Mrs. Deborah Milton could enjoy a moments peace of mind were he to be deprived of ye . smallest degree of happineſs -- I will add no more upon this subject -- I will as You desire endeavour to keep up my Spirits & hope for a favorable change in our 32 ) affairs -- I beg You will not fail to give my kind love to Your Sisters & tell them that I am not one of those of who are prejudiced by a simple trait -- that my Respect & affection for ye . Guardian will not easily be extinguished -- it is only by bearing with others that we can hope for others suffering what may not be pleasant in our own character , to them . besides a good Parent has a right to claim the obedience of his Children . -- & Every Child ought to submit with patience , & if a Parent has a fault to conceal it wth . ye . utmost care from ye . World -- but this is not ye . case wth . ye . Guardian -- we have only to lament that some unworthy Person has gained him to believe a falsehood . I am my Drst- friend extremely desirous that You should find out if the Guardian has really been told that You owe any Money -- fail not to inform me in Your next -- If he has not , I strongly recommend You not to speak upon the subject , why give him unneceſsary pain ? -- all this we will manage without distreſsing him -- I conjure You to let me act in this as I think will be most proper . As You did not mention having recd . my 2 letters wch . contain 'd 3 folio sheets , both wch . I sent to T—— the 3 d of this month I am in a great fright that they have not reach 'd You -- You are very very naughty if You have got them not to have told me so -- & why in ye . name of fortune do You mis-date Your letters ? Yours was dated -- ye . 12 th . You may shew Your Sisters & ye . Guardian Milton s letter -- I think it will divert them -- we are obliged to him for the franks -- I wonder what kind of answer You will send him -- I quite enjoy the thoughts of Your perplexity . The other Packet wch . contains 4 folio sheets & his letter is an Office frank -- now dont keep me in any un̅eceſsary suspence -- a horrid pen -- bad paper -- & a confused head for it achs terribly will renders this unintelligible You I fear , but You must contrive to make it out .

As I wish to reply to Yours without loſs of time I shall send this without a frank . You desire my Advice on an affair in wch I can not be a Competent judge ; therefore I shall not hazard giving My opinion -- I am very sensible of Your affection for me & am properly grateful for the generous intention -- but my Dear friend be aſsured that this proof of Your love I never would accept of for if it should please God to end Your days before we are united & that I should survive You whatever You might have it in Your power to bestow upon me ( except it was some a little trifling gift in token of Your remembrance ) I should immediately restore to Your Father & Sisters -- let not therefore a thought of this kind influence Your conduct in this affair -- what melancholy ideas does this raise , but Heaven grant I may never experience the severe trial of losing You .

Sister -- tis happy for me that I am not of a jealous disposition & that I can easily check my curiosity when I perceive it is not likely to be gratified -- upon my word I dont comprehend this intercourse of seal 'd letters -- I was too proud to ask for what was not offer 'd -- & was obliged to rest satisfied wth : her being so gracious as to read me here & there a line . I sat up till past 12 reading Your letter or rather trying to do so for You had been so sparing of Your ink I dare not say time that not a letter in ye . whole folio was more than one third form 'd . but Your writing is generally very distinct & is certainly an elegant pretty hand -- I am very sure I ought to have been silent for I know I often get into a horrid scrawl -- & doubt not that very often You are as much perplext to make out my letters as I was Yours . Wednesday 26 th . Jan- . 1785 -- tis very provoking that You will never pay any attention to what I say abt . acknowledging my the rect . of my letters more intelligibly -- You thank me for the letters , now I own I have not sagacity enough to find out , ( there being no clue in Your 's to guide me to ye . knowledge of it ) whether You recd . 3 or 2 -- as I wrote sent 2 on ye . 14 th & one on ye . 15 th .

Your request of writing to Your F—— I have already gone as far as was proper -- perhaps further than what was strictly so , -- for and I am certain that to no other Man than Yourself should I ever have been able to have communicated what my friends blamed , viz : the delay . Your F is undoubtedly ye . best judge of what will render him happy or otherwise -- if therefore ye . giving up any part of his property will distreſs him we must give up all thoughts of being united -- if this is not his wish & that he only thinks proper to put off settling his affairs for two Years wch . he proposed -- or for longer we shall be equally obliged to acquiesce . I can not suffer more than I have done , from the opinions of ye . world concerning this affair -- all I 55 ) all I now desire is , that You will gain from Yor . F . the information of his first detirmination & what we are to hope , or what give up -- it is of great consequence to me to have this intelligence as I shall act accordingly & I must say that I have a some right to claim a relief from suspence wch . in ye . end may injure my good name You desired me my Drst . friend to send you some of ye . Milkwoman s Verses -- I will the next packet I can get a frank for . Pray do not be offended any longer wth . ye . poor K . of ye .

I went home wth . her and after giving her in charge to her good friend Lady H . & seeing those things applied wch . the Apothecary order 'd -- for her Memory wd . not have retain 'd any of his directions I came home at 10 o'Clock -- the Sisters also soon arrived -- Handel & I sat together till 12 Wednesday 2 d .

Theatre , so we had no strangers in our Box -- this was Lady Wake 's Benifit wch . was to have been on Monday I was extremely satisfied wth . ye . manner in wch . she performed -- I had wish 'd to see her in one of Shakespeares Characters Plays & as far as I can judge she acted Lady Mac k beth full as well as any other character I have seen her in , I sat next to Mrs. Jackson & was very much pleased wth . her conversation -- I think I shall like her extremely , She is unaffected -- modest -- seems perfectly good temper 'd & to have good sense , she is not a Beauty , but the sweetneſs of her countenance when she speaks , is an atonement if I may so expreſs myself , her complexion , is fair , but there is no color to animate , & her hair is unfortunately quite red -- I do not think one can say she is finely form 'd -- but she is straight slender & of an agreeable height being ye . tallest of ye . common size . She does not seem to aim at that consequence wch . a meaner understanding wd . probably aſsume from being the greatest Heireſs in ye . Kingdom I hope she will be fortunate in her Choice & not have Reason hereafter to lament that she was born ( 63 to inherit such an immense fortune -- I am told that her father has had ye . good sense to aſsure her that he shall not interfere in ye . Subject of marriage & that all he shall require will be that she shall Marry a Gentleman and a Man of good character another thing wch . & she will be sa v f e her from becoming ye . prey of fortunehunters ( as she is safe from being a sacrifice to Ambition by ye . above declaration as she has the greatest affection for , & confidence in her father . I should not have said so much abt . AM but that her fortune makes her a Person of consequence & the World will I suppose have much to say abt . her . if she is so happy at her first entrance into life ( wch . is now ye . case ) not to get into improper sets & form friendships wth . unprincipled young Women of fashion or mere Novel read Miſses she may form a distinguish 'd character as her powers of doing good will be so great & extensive . After ye . play was over we wish 'd to get away but ye . Crowd was so great our Carriages cld . not get up we sat in our Box during one Scene of ye . entertainment wch . was ye . Guardian -- AM Sister was hiſs 'd wch . I did not wonder at as she is a very indifferent actreſs -- she performed ye . part of Harriet -- yet I think for Mrs. Newton sake ye . Audience shd . have spared her -- ye . hiſses for her going off & ye . Claps ( by some good natured persons ) continuing we left our Box and went to ye . Lobby -- I did not get home till ½ past 11 -- ye . whole party attended Mrs. Newton & me to our different abodes -- I was not a little rallied for ye . attention of one of our Beaux who seem 'd in a great fright as I was not in ye . same Coach wth . him that I was lost or left behind as he stop 'd our Coach in a Street knock 'd at ye .

Dear Sister & went to my Room abt . 11 Friday 4 th . Febry : 1785 -- I was so fatigued wth . my walk of Yesterday that instead of getting up I lay reading in bed till near ten o'Clock -- if Your father was to see this , I think he wd . exclaim “ a “ fine London Lady this said Mr Dewes ! . answering Billets to ye . good Dowr . ye .

Sisters I did not dare venture to see him & shall not till Your wit has help 'd you out to an answer to his request- pray dont enclose Your letter to me -- If You chuse to let him or any one have a lock of my hair You may if You please send give them what I so graciously presented You wth . So your dignity was offended in being ask 'd to see the theatrical entertainment of wch . Dogs were are ye . Actors -- now I have heard that it is a wonderful sight & that they fill the parts alloted to each in a surprising manner -- besides I dare say they were not more tortured in learning to besiege a Town & mo u nt a Ladder than Yours when they were train 'd for Hunting or taught to stand at a Partridge . You may depend on my obeying You for I not only Shall not again hint again at ye . 2 Years but never speak on the Subject if I can poſsibly avoid it -- I have brought myself to hear wth . indifference what others say -- this point being gain 'd My Mind is now at Rest -- I feel myself secure of Your affection & esteem -- I know that I shall never change towards You this is sufficient to prevent our being unhappy -- I am no longer anxious , theref ore 66 ) you may be perfectly at ease wth . respect to me -- nor do I wish you not to take any steps , wch . hereafter You may have reason to repent , upon my account , -- I have already too severely felt that You & Your Family wd . have been happier had we never known each other not to be now most anxious to ward off future disquietude -- I am therefore I own no longer desirous than of entering into a situation wch . appears to be attended wth . such uncommon & insurmountable difficulties . I beseech You to follow ye example I mean to set -- let us talk of other things & no longer build Castles in ye . Air , let it suffice to know we love one another without tormenting ourselves wth . fears or forming hopes wch . may never be realized let us be perfectly content wth . the degree of comfort we at present enjoy in ye . certainty of yt affection & reciprocal esteem & confidence I imagine my Dear friend that you have now laid aside all thoughts of letting the Colliery as it goes on so well , I do not presume to advise , but I think if I was in Your place I would keep it in my own hands -- it wd . be very provoking if others were to reap the advantages ( wch now seems likely to ac̅rue , ) when You have had all ye . trouble & difficulties . Friday 5 oClock -- the Dear Sister gave me an hour of her Company before she went out -- ye . Eldest & I dind together -- she has taken herself away according to custom -- a Milener has just brought me a Cap wch . I am to appear in this Eveg . it actually covers ye . dining table . -- I shall lose my friends The St—— & ye D——y 's in the spring the first are to go to Scotland & ye others to Ireland .

Good Night My Dear friend , I hope you are now , safely arrived at Taxal . Friday 25 th March -- This being is Good Friday a day that ought to excite the most heartfelt gratitude & sincerest repentance of our faults , I mean to those who believe that Christ died to save Sinners -- I was alone & read subjects suitable to the day . all Morng -- it rain 'd & snow 'd , I could not go to early Church & gave orders that no body should be let in that I might go at 3 -- but Cramer being gone to Church & not hearing any thing of it when he came home admitted Harrison ( Md . of Honor ) who came at ½ past 2 she wanted me to dine w th them at ye .

Company wch . had been invited to his House went as usual in ye . Eveg & staid playing at Faro till 4 in ye . Morng ; what a want of common humanity , we really appear to have no sense of feeling left -- & ye . People of fashion seem to glory in being a disgrace to their Country -- some anecdotes I heard to day have fill 'd me wth . horror -- O my Dearest friend how happy ought we to esteem ourselves that we poſseſs minds wch . can find happineſs in a quiet & reasonable stile of life , content wth . a moderate competency & loving Virtue too well ever to be tempted by Vice & mad ambition to lose sight of her , I have had opportunities of making observations upon the highest situation , as to rank . I have observed also how far Riches are neceſsary to real satisfaction ambition -- Diſsipation -- and -- fashion I was disgusted wth . , & the result was a confirmation of my early notions , that Riches Rank & c were only so many traps to undermine our Virtue ; for alas few very few are there in high life whose examples either in Public or private we ought to imitate , yet a few there are & it is my boast to be intimately connected wth . them . Was I some years Younger & had seen nothing of ye . World my contempt for what are call 'd its enjoyments wd- not be credited It might be deem 'd that I was romantic & ignorant -- I am neither & You will find me capable of enjoying Retirement & contented wth . the real Luxury of leading a domestic & truly reasonable life , for such my Dr . friend I trust ours will be . - proof of eternal happineſs When Mara left me Handel came in She brought a Sister of hers a pretty Girl of 12 or 13 wth . an engaging Countenance -- they staid wth . me till 4 , I dined at home wth . ye . 2 Sisters sat wth . them till 7 , they went to ye .

I have just dispatch 'd my 2 d . letter to You my Dearest friend -- ye . postman wd . not wait to let me finish what I was talking about , to resume ye . conversation -- wch . I will begin wth- As I was saying -- I went to Mrs. Garrick as soon as I came home -- the Servt . beg 'd me so earnestly to go in that I complied I found her & Mrs. Gar : & a Young Man a Cousin of theirs -- he soon went away -- Lady Stormont came -- after he had seen his patient he neither gave Mrs- hopes , nor did he destroy those she had for she would turn his expreſsions to ye sense she wish 'd -- how natural was this ! -- I talk 'd to her much upon ye . melancholy Subject as I wish to prepare her by degrees to bear up under what must soon happen -- Miſs Hamilton 's Servt . desired I would go & see his Master I complied as I do not think we do right to shrink from such scenes -- it is good for us to be reminded of that later day wch . we must come to . I approach 'd his Bed & took hold of his hand , he look 'd very earnestly at me & when I spoke he immediately recollected me -- ( the Servt . told me yt . I was ye . only person he had seem 'd to know ) He talk 'd a great deal to me & appear 'd to be telling me something -- but his speech was so alter 'd & inarticulate that I could not make out what he said -- except a few words when I was leaving him wch . were “ You are very Good ” -- I staid wth . ye . two friends till within a few Min . of 11 & I obliged Lady Herries to eat some supper as she eats nothing & Miſs Streatfield had told her yt . whether she appetite or no she must take nourishment -- I had ye . comfort of leaving her much more composed than I had found her -- The Sisters came home at ½ past 11 we sat together for ½ an hour .
