Dear Miſs Hamilton I am very sorry It will not be in My Power to come to You tomorrow Evening -- as I Have a Cold in one Eye ; Which May be encreased by going out , as It Is so Cold . If you have only Invited Lady Wallingford , & Lady Caroline Peachy , perhaps You would not dislike , adjourning the Party Here ; but If not convenient to You ; must beg You will excuse me till some Day next Week , as I am engaged If I am well enough to go out ; till after Monday -- If you have not Invited any But those I have Mentioned , or Mrs. Leland , as they are all in My Neighbourhood -- If you determine on coming , Here tomorrow Evening , I can let them know , to save You the Trouble ; I am afraid I can not offer our Carriage , as Sr. Harry Is so particular as to His Horses ; & Is very glad during this Weather that I stay at Home ; I mention this , not to put You to any difficulties , that You May fix accordingly -- I am dear Miſs Hamilton , ever Yrs . Most Affecly -- Frances Harpur Wednesday --
