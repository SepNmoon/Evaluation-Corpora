Hill Street Thursd a y Mg ' My Dear Mrs. Goldsworthy I am much flatter 'd by your kind Letter , & be aſsur e d you do me Justice for I am exactly what you remember me , & do not see why Time & Distance should make any alteration in Friendship , & I hope we shall continue so those Ideas as long as we live -- I beg you will tell Mrs Dickenson I hope her first favorable Opinion of me will be lasting , I will not say how much She struck me , for that is what I supose she must be acustomed to hear but I think her very pleasing both in outwardly , & I am much mistaken if inwardly she is not quite equal -- Now my Dear Miſs Dickenson I will tell you Honestly , that it is not in my power to obey your Commands or rather comply with your wishes in more Friendly Terms , as I would with the greatest pleasure , but I never have , to any of The Princeſses presented any thing ; Mrs Dickenson would certainly be the proper Person to apply to for Lady De Clifford , as to our Dear Princeſs Charlotte of Wales , she is scarcely in this World , but as Lady Charlotte Finch is a friend of Lady Mansfield 's , this Gentleman s Idea of Her , I think very proper , but I must beg you will not name it as my Advice , you see my Dear Princeſs Elizabeth I rely on our Old Friendship respecting a loisir ouvert , as we did in days of Yore -- I your visit did not H arm me but gave me great pleasure -- I am still weak which must plead my excuse for this sad Scrawl , -- I was sorry I could not answer your Letter yesterday , & I hope that you will believe me that I am sorry not to have it in my power to do what you wish -- Yr Affly Mrs Dickenson MC Goldsworthy 18 1 0 1
