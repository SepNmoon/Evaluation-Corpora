4 August 1789 Bath I sent you a Letter yesterday & informed you that I was going to Mrs. Hartley s . at 7 I called to drink Tea with Mrs. Rundell , but she was not returned from some country expedition -- & I found an excuse , & went on to Mrs. H . where I found a Mrs. Campbell & her young Ladies who sang a very pretty duet -- one of them played a very difficult Concerto on the Harpsichord with very great execution -- I do n't know whether my Taste is improved or vitiated but I must confeſs that what is called a Harpsichord Leſson does not gratify me at all -- I have taken a dislike to the instrument -- & what is commonly called fine playing , is to me , an expeditious jumbling of Keys -- Mrs. Holroyd & Miſs Wilberforce came in for half an hour -- Mrs. H . told me that Miſs W . was going the next day to Cowslip Green -- the company went away before ten & Mrs. H.y—— desired me to stay supper -- in five minutes a meſsage came from the Rundells with an invitation to supper wch . I declined of course -- I staid with Mrs. Hartley till near eleven & then called at the Rundells & staid with them till 12 -- As no Letters arrived yesterday from my dearest Mary I was in great doubts what to do , as I knew not what construction might be put upon my letter which gave you an Acct . of the inflammation in my Leg & c -- and as you talked of coming to me , I began to think that might fix your resolution -- however as the weather seemed so fine I thought it better not to defer my journey or rather little tour any longer , as I shd . be at no short distance from Bath ; accordingly this morning at 8 oClock Set out for Bristol and called upon Miſs Mores -- when they told me I had chosen an unlucky time as Hannah was going from home , but when I mentioned Miſs Wilberforce 's intention of going to Cowslip Green , they said , She must be informed of it & preſsed me to go on which I then did not intend to do -- I saw the two eldest only , Patty was engaged in the School I staid about 20 minutes & went to the wells -- Dr. Stonhouse seemed very glad to see me , poor Creature he has suffered excruciating pain lately in having a carbuncle taken off his head , which mortified he never closed his Eyes for ten days & nights -- in the last 48 hours he has had a little sleep & as he can not take any medicine for his old malady the stone now , he is afraid that it may gain too great a head -- he complains that he is obliged to take a pint of Madeira every day which confuses him -- he spoke with great affection of his wife & regard for you -- I desired that I would tell you how happy it made him to see me so much improved in my Looks , which he said were 500 Pr . Cent better than when he saw me 2 years ago . I staid an hour with him , he spoke of a publication of Mr. Hawkins Brownes , which he thought the best thing that has been wrote in our Language for some time -- the Subject is the negligence of the Clergy -- I went from him to Miſs Milnes & had the pleasure of hearing that the old Lady was better -- She gave me a long Acct . of the distreſs she had been in & of her Mother 's illness wch . proved at last to be a Bilious Fever -- I staid with her about half an hour & went on to Cowslip Green -- I was charmed with the view of Clifton from an opposite hill , on the Exeter road , which commands a short view of the river , the rocks , the scattered houses on Clifton , part of Bristol & the adjacent country all round -- I had a most cordial reception from Hannah More & Patty who was arrived here before me -- This little Cottage is exactly what I expected to find -- very neat prettily furnished & c the rooms small -- the little pleasure ground very well planted with shrubs , & an exceſsive pretty Roothouse about 50 yards from the house where they generally breakfast & drink tea it has no pretensions & is exactly what you & I shall like to have in our grove , as it can be made at very little expence -- I made a Sketch of it & the house -- We waited dinner an hour for Miſs Wilberforce but She did not come to day -- I found Hannah very low She attributed it to a disagreeable Accident that had happened which had damped all their summer enjoyment , as there is only one month that the Sisters can live together here -- a Lady who came to pay them a first visit was overturned out of a Phaeton ( luckily by her Husband ) into a little rivulet near the house ; she was nearly suffocated by the Mud & her back was so much injured that she could not be turned in bed for 3 weeks -- She was brought to Miſs Mores , apparently dead , & was taken away upon a litter -- this was a terrible thing upon the Sisters , as they have only one spare bed , & they were obliged to exert themselves to keep up the Husband s spirits , who was almost distracted -- Patty exerted herself and was in good spirits of course very agreeable -- I spoke of Mrs. Garrick s coming to Bath with great glee -- a certain person seemed very cool upon that Subject -- I said : “ I suppose you of course will go to Bath to meet her . ” No , She knows my summer engagements and is so good as to excuse me ” -- this appears to me very odd -- has there been an Eclairciſsement here -- She said “ probably you will find there at your return “ but this is very uncertain ” which was repeated -- was a friend of mine to come to a place so near me on Acct . of Health & I disengaged -- casual engagements would be set aside , I fancy -- 5 / at 9 oClock a Mr- —— who 's name I dont at this moment recollect came to breakfast from Bristol , he is brother to a Clergyman who has wrote a great deal about the Abolition of the Slave Trade , as this is a subject very near Hannah 's heart , of course nothing else was talked of -- a thousand instances of barbarity were spoken of , wch struck me with horror , & I thought it impoſsible for a human being to be so diabolical -- Mr. C . came with me 5 miles when I turned off to go to Lady Fust s -- he is a very pleasant young Man & an enthusiast in the cause -- Miſs More has lately written a very pretty thing which she gave me for you -- the Title of it Bishop Bonner 's Ghost -- I am very much pleased with it -- the whole is a compliment to the Bishop of London -- in forming a confession between the two -- She wrote it at Mrs. Boscawen 's who shewed it to Mr. Walpole -- & he insisted upon printing it at Strawberry Hill -- ( by the way excuse me for saying , I wish that the Roses Strawberries & Cowslips did not always blow -- they are delightful in Season to be sure ) and he has prefixed a print of Strawberry Hill -- a few copies were reserved for his friends & the rest for the author . -- at 12 I took my Leave with many civil things for you -- & arrived at Lady Fust s at 2 -- I traveled thrō a delightful Country and had a friendly reception from Lady F—— who has not been well for several days -- she is very bilious -- Miſs Hamilton was very civil & attentive -- 6 / This is a small house where Lady F . enjoys retirement -- in some respects it is a pleasant situation -- in a fine country and beautiful views from its neighborhood -- but 11 miles from market & post Town , & every thing dear & hardly to be got on any Acct . / 6 / This morning I took a ride upon the downs which command an extensive view of the Severn covered with Ships & small veſsels & a very fine prospect of the Welsh Coast , & Glocestershire Lady F . told me the Story of Miſs Fust 's elopement , which is the blackest affair I ever heard of -- /7/ at one oClock to day I left Capenor Lodge -- Lady F . wished me to stay a few days longer & I shd . have been very glad to have complied with her desire ; but I could not divest my self of my anxiety about you & I had already prolonged my Tour a day longer than I at first intended -- at Clifton I accidentally met Miſs Newton 's Dr. Patten 's nieces , & I promised to dine with them -- I called upon Miſs Milnes & found her in good spirits looking very well -- I had been uneasy about her for she appeared to be flushed & feverish when I saw her before -- I did not see Mrs. M—— who does not yet admit Strangers -- I staid an hour & then went to Dr. Stonehouse -- he poor man was but indifferent , but he keeps up his Spirits wonderfully -- he asked me to dine with him -- & desired me to say many kind things to you and to compliment you upon my good looks -- I dined with the Ladies at their Lodging -- the set was not a pleasant one to me they seemed very well satisfied , which was well enough -- I did not stay Tea -- but proceeded homewards where I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 2 d . Int & my dear Louisa 's too which I kiſsed 20 times -- Indeed my dearest Wife -- we must not be parted any more -- I can bear any thing but a separation from you & no earthly consideration can make me any amends for the loſs of yr- company -- two hearts , so firmly & so affy . united , should be so in every sense -- God bleſs you -- I love you dearly , & shall now tell you so in person very soon -- I have just been to Dr. Fothergill 's -- he was not at home -- I left word that I wd . call upon him in the Evening -- It is my intention to leave this place on Monday 17 th . I shall come leisurely -- to Worcester the first , the second to Birmingham & on Wednesday Eveg- I shall have ye- happineſs of embracing you -- if the Afternoon shd . not be wet , be so good as to send Mira to Buxton -- the Coach , I see , by an advertisement , arrives there at 8 oClock -- I can ride home & it will save me 7/6 -- I am not fond of a Chair from Buxton in the Dark -- & I will not sleep within six Miles of my dear Mary -- Mrs. Garrick is not come yet -- at least I can not hear of her -- I rejoice that my Sisters are going to vary the Scene -- perhaps it may turn out well -- Sir David Murray is here -- I like him -- there seems to be an honest seamanlike Bluntneſs about him -- Adieu God bleſs you I am ever most Affy . & faithfully your JD The harvest is begun & there are yet many hundred acres of Graſs uncut -- the weather is now intensely hot -- we have had No Thunder at all My Compliments to Mr. Gaskell -- I see his Acquaintance strutting about with his pupil every day -- I wish he was in as fair a way to be provided for When Mr. Cooper writes to my Father , how surprised he would be to see two , 00 , s , instead of one -- I might alledge that it was only a small mistake of mine -- To Mrs. Dickenson Taxal Chapel le frith Derbyshire x post
