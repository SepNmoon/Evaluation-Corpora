Mrs. Garrick after having made engagements for every day this week is gone off to Hampton for the rest of the week and has left me to pay them which I am very ill able to do , having been very ill since I saw You . It is indeed an age since I have seen Mrs. Walsingham . I shall be happy to wait on her next tuesday , and so I dare say will Mrs. Garrick ; but for her I never answer as Mrs. W . knows . I will keep myself disengaged for Tuesday till I hear her commands ; & I dont know that Mrs. G . has any engagement ; Wednesday and Thursday we are both engaged I will wait on Mrs. W . the first morning I am able to walk so far . Adieu ! I hope to call on You soon . Glad Baby 's better . Your affectionate H More Wednesday To Mrs. Dickenson N o . 5 George Stre et Han : Squ are
