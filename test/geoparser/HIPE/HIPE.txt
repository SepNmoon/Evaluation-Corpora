FROM A VIRGINIA PAPER . To his EXCELLENCY the GOVERNOR GINIA . NEW - YORK , SEPT . 28 , 1780 . SIR , W E have long waited in anxious expectations , of having it in our power to tranlinit effec ¬ tual Amendments to the Conftitution of the Uni ¬ ted Stares , and it is with grief that we now fend forward propolitions inadequate to the purpofe of real and fubftantial Amendments , and fo far fhort of the wiihes of our country . By perufing the Journal of the Senate , your Excellency will fee , that we did , in vain , bring to view the Amend ¬ ments propofed by our Convention , and approv ¬ ed by the Legiflature . We fltall tranfmit a com ¬ plete let of the Journals of both Houfes of Con - grefsto your addrefs , which with a letter accom panying them , we entreat your Excellency will have the gaodnefs to lay before the Honorable Legillature of the enfuing meeting . We have the honor , of every ( entiment of rc - fpeCt , to be , Sir , your Excellency ’ s moft obedient , and very humble fervants , RICHARD HENRY LEE WILLIAM GRAYSON . PRESIDENT SULL IVAN ’ s MESSAGE . To the Hon . Senate and House ^ / ' Represen ¬ tatives , [ 0 / New - Hampshire . ] Gentlemen , H HVING been informed , that doubts have a - rifen iu the minds of fome , whether my hav ¬ ing accepted the office of Diftricft Judge has not difqualified me from aefling as Prefident of the State , until a new election takes place , I confefs that 1 have never been able to difcover any in ¬ compatibility in the two offices . But as fome have attempted to prove this by urging the words of aConflitution framed for thepurpofe of efta - blifhing over the people of New - Humpfhire a free , fovereign and independent government — 1 mull obferve , that this govennent has [ nice been changed by the voice of the people , who have agreed that their fafety depended on their relinquifhuig many of the powers retained by the people in that Conflitution , to a General Government eflabl ' fbed for the people of each and every State who fnould adopt it ; which to themwai to become the general law of the land . The people of this State did , in the moff folemn manner , a dipt arid ratify that Conflitution ; and from that e - vent , this ceased to be a free , sovereign , andindependent state ; and upon my being elcdled to the office of Prefident , I was only fworn to perform and fulfil the duties incumbent on me as Prefident of a free and confederate State ; and I was at or near the fame time fworn to fupport the Confti union of the United States , by virtue ofalaw enacted by yourfelves . I was appointed under that Conflitution which the people of New - Hampffiire had adopted for themfelves , a Judge of the Federal Court . My own inclinations were far from leading me to wifh to continue in both offices ; but I was put in by the people , and could not devife a way of re - figning the truft committed to me , but into the hands who honoured me with it . I well knew that the time for electing a new Prefident was near at hand , when the people might have an op ¬ portunity of declaring who fhould prefide over them ; and all the public papers having been en - trufted to my care , and the affairs of the State un ¬ folded to me , I could not , without an unpardona - ble breach of truft , negleifl to lay them before you . I alfo confidered , that while I was living in the State , no other perfon could , by your own laws , adminilter the neceffary oaths to you , to qualify you to aeft as Legifiators , while the time for which I was chofen was not expired ; and as I knew that this would probably be the laft feflion of this Court , for the prefent year ; and I had no inclination to propofe myfelf as a candidate for another — I concluded delicacy would have pre ¬ vented fome perfons from purfuing the methods they have adopted , for gratifying a fpirit which ought never to lodge itfelf in the branch of a Legifla - ture . Gentlemen , You will fee the fituation I am in , and may eafily conceive of my feelings upon this fubjeeft , being brought forward , at every opportunity , to fa ’ - tiate that fpirit which has often , before this fejjion of the Court , difplayed itfelf before me , and ufed every effort againfl me . The Prefident and Senate of the United States were , at the time of my appointment , well ac ¬ quainted with my having to finifh my year in prefiding over this State ; but no hint has ever been given tome of my acceptance of an office under the prefent general government , rendering void any State appointment ; even though I have had the honour of being often , fince my accep ¬ tance of the office of Diftridl Judge for New - Hampfttire , in company with the Prefident of the United States , who knew I was the Prefident of this State , and treated me as fuch , although he at the fame time knew that I had long before accept ¬ ed the office of Federal Judge . I know the candour and juftice of the members of both branches ; and I have too high an opinion of their integrity and uprightnefs to fuppofe , that they will fuffer themfelves to be influenced by the efforts of one or more , who cannot avoid at every opportunity , difeovering the fpirit which alhi - ates them in their conduB . I have the honour , & c . & c . JOHN SULLIVAN . Dec . 29 , 1789 . _ _ LONDON , Dec . 31 . The official account of the capture ofBruffels pnbliflied by the Patriots , is as under . It is dated the 12tli of December . “ At length , notwithftanding the armifiice , and every other pretence , joo brave Patriots of Brufiels have dared to engage in battle with 6poo Aullrains . The action commencedyelterday af ¬ ternoon , at four o ’ clock . The firft attenpt was.tp make prifoners of all the loldiers who guarded the Mint , and thofe who were quartered in the different converts . General D ’ Alton did his tu ¬ rnoff from fix o ’ clock in the morning to negociate an armifiice . About ( even o ’ clock , 8co men of Benden - D ’ Aloft entered the city with two pieces of cannon , which they planted on the Grand Pa ¬ lace . About ten o ’ clock General D ’ Alton thought proper to fend a large dctatchment in order to releafe , by forcible means , the ollicers and pri ¬ vates made prifoners in lhe Bafleville . This was the fignal for a new engagement , which will be ever memorable for its victory . The Patriots no longer able to contain themfelves , routed the whole detatchment . To the number of joo , at the utmoft , they invelled the great market , and after a mod obllinatc conflict , they made them ¬ felves mafters of the Coros de Garde , and two pieces of cannon , and took obotlt 400 Auftrians prifoners . About the fame time the engagement re - commenced in all quartersof the city ; and , in lefs than two hours , the Patriots made themfelves matter of the barracks of the military andofthe magazines , in which they found near 2,000 muf - kets , befides cartridges , ammunition , & c . To ¬ wards noon , they attacked the Park and the Pal ¬ ace Royale , where the greateft body of troops were concentered , with 12 pieces or cannon . After a very heavy firing on both fides , D ’ Alton perceiving that the place was no longer tenable againtt fo much bravery , capitulated for the im ¬ mediate retreat of his whole gerrifon ; and the requell having been acceded to , about one o ’ clock they departed , with great precipitation , through the Porte de Namur . But as all the foldieis arc not equally inclined to follow hinj , at the mo ¬ ment this is writing , they are fquabbling among theinlelves , without the city . Already , we have got more than 3,000 prifoners ; buta few killed , and no houfes plundered . For the Gazstte of the Unites States , i Letter I . TO THOMAS JEFFERSON , Vise President of the Unit . ! States , Philad : July 3 , 1800 . AS you are a candidate for the Supreme - Magistracy ot the United States , a know ¬ ledge of your character and qualifications becomes a subject of great importance to every lover of his country . — Had you been content to have moved in the humble walks of private life and never interfered in politi ¬ cal concerns , I would not have troubled you cr the public with these setters , since your vices or your virtues could have had but little relation to our national happiness ; — You might then , Sir , have Aided down the current of Use in obscurity , and at least have had the consolation to know that your de ¬ formities were hidden from the world . But , as , Sir , you have appeared on the stage of public life in a variety of situations , and now offer yourself as a candidate for the Presi - drncy , you will please excuse the liberty I take to investigate a character , which , from a false opinion of , your country may perhitps confide her dearest interest to . It is my duty , as it is my wiffi , to give you credit for every great or good quality you possess , and to speak with gratitude of any services you have rendered America in the course of a long life busied with public cares , — - But , Sir , it is also my duty to speak ot those other qualities of your ' heart and mind which have been also employed in the national ass.irs of our country . Nature , Sir , in profusion , gifted you witli talents , a brilliant fancy , penetrating genius and a native elegance of diction , combined with a thirst for knowledge , formed yqp a man of lea rung and taste , well acquainted with the classics , deeply read in the philoso - phy of natural history , observant of men and things , and attentive in theory to political concerns . But , to balance tin fe singular favors , stie denied you others , which , to “ move in the tempestuous sea of liberty , " or guide the helm of a great nation , are of more utility and absolutely indispensable . — Your fortitude has been often tried and found unequal to the talk — much less arduous than the one you are fa indefatigably striving to impose on yourself ; , your mind is fitted for a sedentary life , and in your closet you may study , with honor to yourself , the works of Nature ; but the fatigues , perseverance and firm Mnper , nectssiry in an Executive sta ¬ tion , would wear out the remains of those delicate nerves which have on former occa ¬ sions so often shrunk from the approach of danger , and rendered an enlightened under ¬ standing useless to its possessor and injurious to his country . Let me conjure you , Sir , to call to your remembrance the history of your political life , and from a regard to your peace and reputation , not involve yourself in that disgrace which must inevitably attend your acceptance of the Presidency . You have been , Sir , a Governor , an Ambassador , and a Secretary of State , and had to desert each of these posts , from that weakness of nerves , want of fortitude and total imbecility of character , which have marked your whole political carier , and most probably will at ¬ tend you to your grave . Remember , Sir , , all the services youevei rendered your coun ¬ try were of the literary kind—The Declara ¬ tion of Independence was penned in , your closet , where you were perfectly secure ; but I do not recollect that you supported that Declaration by any extraordinary exer ¬ tion , or by exposing yourself to any immi ¬ nent danger . When Governor - os Virginia , you sled from your state because a storm was gathering , and declined a foreign appoint ¬ ment by Congress . A ; the danger was visi - ble , you acted consistently with your chr - racter , but surely did liot display either much firmness or patriotism . But , Sir , weakness of nerves and want of fortitude are nayiral defects—they are not faults of your own—tho ’ were you , con ¬ scious of your desects , to accept the impor ¬ tant office of President , when the liberty and rights of millions and the happiness of your country are depending , it would th my opinion , amount to a crime . But I will no longer dwell on these topics—In my next letter I will consider you as the htad of a party devoted to the enemies of America , and a party created for her ruin . COLUMBUS .

TO THE Cultivators oftlieSul THE AMERICA * FARMER . T HE first number of the AMERICAN FARMER , was issued on the 2d of April 1819 . It may now be announced as an es tablisbed National work , adapted to all the varieties of our climate , since many oi the most eminent citizens in all the states , con tribute by their patronage and their pens , to its circulation and its usefulness To make known all discoveries in the sci ence , and all improvements in the practice of Agriculture and Domestic Economy—and to develope the means and designate plans of internal improvements generally , consti tute the chief objects to which the American Farmer is devoted . It takes no concern or interest in party politics , nor inthe transient occurrences of the day . The Farmer is published weekly , on . - heel the size of a large newspaper , and folded o as to make eight pages—and to ad ¬ mit of being conveniently bound up and preserved in volumes . Each volume will consist of fifty - two numbers , a title page and an index ; and numerous Engravings to re ¬ present new implements , and approved sys ¬ tems of husbandry Each number gives a true and accurate statement of the th * m selling prices of coun ¬ try produce , live stock and all tbe principal articles brought for sale in the Baltimore market . .
