finding,0
out,0
the,0
Watch,0

that,0
constantly,0
attends,0
at,0
Pancridge-Church,0
",",0
he,0
made,0
his,0
Complaint,0
to,0
them,0

who,0
immediately,0
went,0
in,0
pursuit,0
of,0
the,0
Rogues,0

in,0
the,0
very,0
next,0
Ground,0
met,0
with,0
Three,0
men,0
on,0
foot,0

which,0
the,0
Gentleman,0
immediately,0
concluded,0
to,0
be,0
those,0
that,0
had,0
Rob,0
'd,0
him,0
",",0
as,0
I,0
think,0
any,0
man,0
would,0
have,0
done,0
in,0
his,0
case,0
.,0
But,0
upon,0
their,0
Tryal,0
it,0
was,0
proved,0
that,0
they,0
were,0
honest,0
Labourers,0

so,0
that,0
no,0
manifest,0
proof,0
coming,0
against,0
them,0

any,0
thing,0
being,0
positively,0
sworn,0
to,0

they,0
were,0
likewise,0
acquitted,0

These,0
two,0
instances,0

though,0
they,0
may,0
not,0
give,0
the,0
Reader,0
that,0
satisfaction,0
he,0
expects,0
",",0
because,0
there,0
is,0
no,0
condemnation,0
or,0
Execution,0
in,0
the,0
case,0
",",0
yet,0
my,0
design,0
in,0
the,0
reciting,0
them,0
is,0
rather,0
to,0
warn,0
all,0
people,0
that,0
they,0
take,0
care,0
how,0
they,0
wander,0
late,0
in,0
the,0
Evening,0
about,0
the,0
out-skirts,0
of,0
the,0
City,0

than,0
to,0
satisfie,0
the,0
curiosity,0
of,0
such,0
as,0
take,0
delight,0
to,0
see,0
and,0
hear,0
of,0
the,0
tragical,0
ends,0
of,0
those,0
miserable,0
wretches,0

that,0
are,0
the,0
Authors,0
of,0
such,0
mischief,0

for,0
the,0
satisfaction,0
of,0
such,0
we,0
come,0
in,0
