went,0
up,0
to,0

went,0
into,0

met,0

was,0
in,0

sat,0
down,0
upon,0

talked,0
over,0

had,0
done,0

I,0
was,0
some,0

it,0
was,0

I,0
do,0
not,0

I,0
parted,0
with,0

walked,0
round,0

an,0
intention,0
of,0
going,0
into,0

when,0
I,0
came,0
I,0
turned,0

walked,0
along,0
the,0
road,0
that,0
leads,0
from,0
Basewater-gate,0

I,0
turned,0
back,0

I,0
came,0
back,0

met,0

walked,0
together,0

came,0
to,0
Grosvenor-gate,0

there,0
we,0
turned,0
back,0

came,0
back,0
together,0
again,0

turned,0

thought,0

came,0

did,0

down,0

crossed,0

seemed,0
much,0
in,0

pushed,0
me,0
off,0

passed,0
on,0
