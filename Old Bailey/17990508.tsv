Mr.,0
Alley,0
.,0
Some,0
observations,0
have,0
been,0
made,0
by,0
the,0
learned,0
Gentleman,0
of,0
so,0
strange,0
a,0
nature,0
",",0
that,0
I,0
think,0
they,0
certainly,0
require,0
an,0
answer,0
.,0
The,0
learned,0
Gentleman,0
began,0
by,0
mentioning,0
the,0
case,0
of,0
Sir,0
Harry,0
Ferrers,0
;,0
he,0
says,0
",",0
it,0
arose,0
on,0
a,0
warrant,0
which,0
stiled,0
him,0
Knight,0
",",0
when,0
it,0
caught,0
to,0
have,0
stiled,0
him,0
Baronet,0
",",0
and,0
that,0
therefore,0
they,0
had,0
no,0
right,0
to,0
take,0
up,0
the,0
person,0
whom,0
they,0
did,0
take,0
up,0
.,0
Now,0
that,0
is,0
exactly,0
what,0
I,0
contend,0
for,0
",",0
and,0
so,0
that,0
case,0
approximates,0
to,0
this,0
;,0
for,0
I,0
say,0
that,0
the,0
officers,0
had,0
no,0
right,0
to,0
take,0
Sullivan,0
while,0
he,0
was,0
demeaning,0
himself,0
peaceably,0
and,0
quietly,0
",",0
nor,0
any,0
of,0
those,0
whom,0
they,0
arrested,0
",",0
for,0
there,0
was,0
not,0
one,0
of,0
them,0
an,0
offender,0
against,0
the,0
statute,0
.,0
Again,0
",",0
as,0
to,0
the,0
other,0
cases,0
",",0
he,0
has,0
argued,0
in,0
myfavour,0
",",0
and,0
drawn,0
the,0
chain,0
tighter,0
",",0
if,0
possible,0
",",0
against,0
himself,0
.,0
He,0
says,0
",",0
the,0
persons,0
taken,0
into,0
custody,0
made,0
no,0
resistance,0
;,0
they,0
were,0
taken,0
",",0
and,0
they,0
submitted,0
as,0
they,0
ought,0
to,0
have,0
submitted,0
.,0
So,0
I,0
might,0
say,0
in,0
the,0
case,0
of,0
Hugget,0
;,0
he,0
had,0
submitted,0
",",0
but,0
said,0
",",0
that,0
did,0
not,0
justify,0
the,0
officers,0
",",0
they,0
were,0
still,0
trespassers,0
:,0
the,0
restraint,0
of,0
liberty,0
was,0
improper,0
and,0
illegal,0
",",0
and,0
therefore,0
it,0
was,0
held,0
to,0
be,0
manslaughter,0
only,0
.,0
The,0
same,0
observation,0
applies,0
in,0
the,0
case,0
of,0
the,0
Queen,0
and,0
Tooley,0
;,0
the,0
woman,0
was,0
in,0
custody,0
at,0
the,0
very,0
time,0

at,0
a,0
distance,0
from,0
the,0
place,0
where,0
the,0
assault,0
was,0
committed,0
",",0
and,0
the,0
prisoners,0
first,0
drew,0
their,0
swords,0
",",0
and,0
attacked,0
the,0
officer,0
",",0
and,0
the,0
heat,0
of,0
passion,0
had,0
abundant,0
time,0
to,0
subside,0
",",0
but,0
what,0
did,0
they,0
do,0
?,0
They,0
made,0
a,0
second,0
attack,0
upon,0
the,0
officers,0
",",0
and,0
drew,0
their,0
swords,0
again,0
;,0
but,0
here,0
the,0
attack,0
is,0
all,0
sudden,0
",",0
no,0
interval,0

no,0
time,0
for,0
the,0
passion,0
of,0
the,0
human,0
mind,0

subside,0

therefore,0
it,0
is,0

of,0
the,0
accused,0
