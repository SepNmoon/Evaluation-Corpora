that	O

had	O
received	O
some	O
blow	O
or	O
injury	O
upon	O
that	O
ruptured	O
part	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
do	O
imagine	O
principally	O
was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
his	O
death	O
,	O
though	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
had	O
a	O
rupture	O
I	O
much	O
question	O
whether	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
his	O
death	O
or	O
not	O

a	O

Bulcock	O

Whether	O
it	O
would	O
