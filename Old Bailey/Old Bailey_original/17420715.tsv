the	O

the	O
State	O
of	O
the	O
Evidence	O
on	O

Now	O
Gentlemen	O

you	O

to	O
consider	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
Fact	O

Murder	O
,	O

or	O
Chance-Medley	O
:	O
Murder	O
,	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
in	O
Point	O
of	O
Law	O
,	O
is	O
,	O
when	O
a	O

another	O
with	O

Malice	O
and	O
Design	O
,	O
or	O
with	O

Malice	O
,	O
as	O
when	O
it	O
is	O
without	O
any	O

if	O
there	O

,	O
a	O
Person	O

killed	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
Manslaughter	O
;	O
now	O
there	O
are	O
several	O
Things	O
in	O
the	O
Course	O
of	O
the	O
Evidence	O
proper	O
to	O
come	O
under	O
your	O
Consideration	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
observe	O
that	O
Egglestone	O
swears	O
Mr	O
Annesley	O
said	O
,	O
Damn	O
your	O
Blood	O
deliver	O
your	O
Net	O
,	O
or	O
you	O
are	O
a	O
dead	O
Man	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
immediately	O
the	O
Gun	O
went	O
off	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Man	O
was	O
shot	O
;	O
if	O
he	O
let	O
the	O
Gun	O
off	O
designedly	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
Case	O
,	O
though	O
on	O
a	O

,	O
he	O
can	O
be	O
guilty	O
of	O
no	O
less	O
than	O
Manslaughter	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
you	O
will	O
consider	O
what	O
different	O
Things	O
the	O
Boy	O
has	O
said	O
;	O
he	O
has	O
declared	O
several	O

not	O
believe	O
he	O
did	O
it	O
designedly	O
,	O
and	O
according	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
Surgeons	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
probable	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
Would	O
could	O
be	O
given	O
in	O
the	O
Situation	O
he	O

Mr	O

in	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

if	O
he	O

the	O
