which	O

therefore	O
it	O
was	O
truly	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
by	O
the	O
Counsel	O
that	O

you	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
guilty	O
of	O
no	O

at	O
all	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
be	O
satisfied	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
this	O
fact	O
was	O
committed	O
,	O
his	O
mind	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
distraction	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
no	O
longer	O
be	O
sensible	O
of	O
the	O
internal	O
distinction	O
between	O
right	O
and	O
wrong	O

more	O

the	O
distinction	O
between	O
the	O
affection	O
that	O
was	O
due	O

wife	O
,	O
and	O
this	O

outrage	O

committed	O
upon	O

that	O
though	O
his	O
hand	O
was	O
guilty	O

free	O

that	O

would	O

no	O

it	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
most	O

that	O
this	O
man	O
is	O
in	O
no	O

habit	O

state	O
of	O
lunacy	O
;	O

has	O
sufficient	O

to	O

to	O

this	O

that	O
which	O

this	O

so	O

this	O

which	O
end	O

;	O
for	O
in	O
those	O

that	O
the	O

here	O

for	O
it	O
is	O

came	O
over	O
from	O

I	O
think	O
you	O
have	O
given	O
sufficient	O
evidence	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Banks	O
that	O
was	O
entitled	O
to	O

I	O

prima	O

though	O
not	O
conclusive	O

that	O

the	O

of	O

the	O
substance	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
the	O

personated	O
that	O
executor	O
in	O

now	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
fact	O
capable	O

direct	O
proof	O

it	O

not	O
a	O
fact	O

like	O
others	O

that	O
must	O
necesrily	O
be	O
collected	O
from	O
circumstances	O
and	O
inferences	O
;	O
the	O
direct	O
and	O
proper	O
proof	O
is	O
to	O
call	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
,	O
whose	O
business	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
wages	O
,	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
done	O
;	O
it	O
therefore	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
circumstance	O

the	O
accident	O
of	O
not	O
being	O
proved	O
by	O
that	O
evidence	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
best	O

from	O
the	O
forgetfulness	O
of	O

no	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O

should	O

which	O

not	O
the	O

;	O
therefore	O
the	O
inclination	O

my	O
opinion	O

,	O
that	O
this	O

not	O

when	O
a	O
