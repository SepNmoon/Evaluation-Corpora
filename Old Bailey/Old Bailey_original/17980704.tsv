from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

this	O

that	O

was	O
founded	O
upon	O
the	O
idea	O

or	O
at	O

the	O
hope	O

that	O
the	O

might	O
see	O
the	O

might	O
afterwards	O
become	O

that	O

policy	O
of	O

it	O
will	O

that	O
if	O

,	O
they	O

the	O

it	O
could	O

of	O
no	O
interest	O

the	O

the	O
interest	O

their	O

Gentlemen	O

I	O
shall	O
state	O
shortly	O
the	O
points	O
to	O
which	O
your	O
attention	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
directed	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
appears	O
by	O
the	O
evidence	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
when	O
the	O
agreement	O
was	O
at	O
an	O
end	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
refused	O
to	O
come	O
to	O

a	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
struck	O
;	O
now	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
strike	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
certainly	O
an	O
act	O
that	O
tended	O
to	O
impoverish	O
the	O
trade	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
so	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
any	O
proceeding	O
which	O
took	O
place	O
by	O
Atkinson	O
,	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
defendants	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O

that	O
took	O

is	O
stated	O
upon	O
the	O
evidence	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
upon	O
this	O
indictment	O

supposing	O
any	O
one	O

them	O

the	O
other	O

the	O
crime	O
is	O
made	O
out	O
against	O
them	O

You	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
that	O
these	O
people	O
have	O
been	O
acting	O
as	O
a	O
benefit	O

;	O
these	O
men	O
might	O
have	O
a	O

but	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
follow	O
,	O
that	O
pursuing	O
that	O

,	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
do	O
the	O
acts	O
stated	O
upon	O
the	O
indictment	O
;	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
taken	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
that	O
meeting	O
to	O
apply	O
it	O
to	O
other	O
purposes	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
illegal	O
,	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
collect	O
from	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
evidence	O
,	O
whether	O
these	O
five	O
persons	O

is	O
imputed	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
fairly	O
draw	O
that	O
conclusion	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
them	O
guilty	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
satisfied	O

that	O
there	O

of	O
