this	O

against	O
a	O

You	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
that	O
this	O
woman	O
has	O
come	O
by	O
her	O
death	O
by	O
a	O
violent	O
outrage	O
committed	O
on	O
her	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
murder	O
in	O
somebody.The	O
next	O
consideration	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
do	O
or	O
do	O
not	O
afford	O
you	O
solid	O
and	O
satisfactory	O
grounds	O
to	O
conclude	O
that	O
she	O
did	O
come	O
by	O
her	O
death	O
by	O
an	O
outrage	O
committed	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
her	O
husband	O
.	O
You	O
see	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
the	O
circumstances	O
are	O
brought	O
to	O
fix	O
it	O
upon	O
him	O
:	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
was	O
last	O
with	O
her	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
undertaken	O
the	O
charge	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
who	O
had	O
appointed	O
her	O
to	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
particular	O
place	O
where	O
she	O
was	O
to	O
town	O
,	O
on	O
a	O
pretence	O
that	O
seems	O
now	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
founded	O
in	O
fact	O
;	O
and	O
having	O
given	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
many	O
other	O
circumstances	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
considerable	O
degree	O
of	O
personal	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
outrage	O
.	O
And	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
whether	O
this	O
is	O
,	O
or	O
is	O
not	O
,	O
equal	O
to	O
that	O
sort	O

thinking	O
it	O

no	O

the	O

considerably	O
worse	O

I	O
found	O

in	O
general	O
unanimous	O
that	O
it	O

as	O
I	O
offered	O
them	O

that	O
in	O

that	O
when	O

left	O

that	O

than	O

;	O
because	O

though	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
such	O
violence	O
as	O
would	O
affect	O
the	O
constancy	O
of	O

standing	O
over	O
her	O

her	O

does	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
equivalent	O
to	O
holding	O
a	O
pistol	O
to	O
the	O
breast	O
of	O
a	O

;	O
therefore	O

I	O
can	O

it	O
to	O

any	O

less	O
than	O
robbery	O
;	O
the	O
consequence	O

that	O

,	O
that	O
they	O

it	O
with	O

Therefore	O
you	O
are	O
to	O
consider	O

whether	O
the	O

sufficiently	O
established	O
against	O
both	O

so	O

that	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O

about	O
it	O

upon	O
the	O

of	O
Mrs	O

the	O

For	O
the	O

of	O
example	O

I	O
can	O
not	O

you	O

if	O
you	O
should	O

opinion	O
that	O

I	O
can	O

you	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
less	O
degree	O
of	O
attrociousness	O
than	O
robbery	O
:	O
the	O
tender	O
years	O
of	O
these	O
persons	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
circumstance	O
to	O
be	O
attended	O
to	O
in	O
other	O
views	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
denomination	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
dangerous	O
thing	O
to	O

,	O
if	O
you	O
were	O
to	O

lower	O
the	O

that	O

that	O
they	O
are	O
both	O

or	O
either	O
of	O

I	O

you	O
