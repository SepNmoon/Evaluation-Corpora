Mr.	O

on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O

contended	O

that	O
the	O

a	O

;	O
that	O
it	O

pays	O

This	O
case	O

by	O
Mr.	O

the	O
part	O

agree	O
,	O
that	O
there	O

The	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
what	O
constitutes	O
a	O
dwelling-house	O
.	O
Now	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
this	O
house	O
as	O
proved	O
?	O
Who	O
takes	O
the	O
house	O
?	O
Mr.	O

;	O
he	O

he	O
divested	O
himself	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
any	O

But	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
has	O
his	O
business	O
carried	O
on	O
in	O
this	O
house	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
contended	O
,	O
that	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
separation	O
of	O
the	O
premisses	O
;	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
agree	O
in	O
that	O
;	O
I	O
consider	O
it	O
as	O
not	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
occupation	O
;	O
he	O
resides	O
there	O
himself	O
and	O
his	O
servants	O
.	O
The	O
next	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
partners	O
have	O
any	O
share	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
?	O
do	O
they	O
contribute	O
to	O

do	O
they	O

to	O
the	O
taxes	O

or	O
to	O
the	O
servants	O
?	O
Now	O
let	O
us	O
see	O
whether	O
the	O
servants	O
of	O
the	O
partnership	O
are	O
confined	O
to	O
this	O
office	O
;	O
so	O
far	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
clerks	O
sleeps	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Welch	O
.	O
That	O
does	O
away	O
the	O
separation	O
:	O
I	O
am	O
of	O
opinion	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
dwelling-house	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Welch	O
,	O
because	O
neither	O
of	O
the	O
partners	O
are	O
bound	O
to	O
pay	O
rent	O
nor	O
taxes	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
consider	O
them	O
as	O
occupiers	O
of	O
this	O
house	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
not	O
only	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
servant	O
sleep	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
rent	O
and	O
taxes	O
;	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
pay	O
rent	O
and	O
taxes	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
sole	O
occupation	O
of	O
Mr.	O

.	O
If	O
it	O
were	O
a	O
fact	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
contribute	O
to	O
the	O
rent	O
and	O
taxes	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
let	O
them	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
second	O
count	O
would	O
apply	O
,	O
for	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
the	O
dwelling-house	O
of	O
the	O
three	O
partners	O
;	O
