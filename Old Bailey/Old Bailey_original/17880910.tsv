the	O

it	O

the	O

of	O
this	O

,	O
in	O
order	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
supported	O
:	O
first	O
it	O
is	O
essential	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
appear	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
those	O
persons	O
were	O
not	O
casually	O
or	O

for	O
the	O

the	O
number	O
of	O
30	O

40	O
on	O

by	O
the	O

,	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
running	O
up	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
strong	O
circumstance	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
of	O
the	O
cart	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
clear	O
symptom	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
sort	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
the	O
common-sense	O
of	O
the	O
thing	O
speaks	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
premeditated	O
design	O
to	O
rescue	O
these	O
goods	O
,	O
both	O
by	O

in	O
which	O
they	O
conducted	O
themselves	O
towards	O
the	O

The	O
next	O
essential	O
ingredient	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
these	O

liable	O
to	O
duty	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O

to	O

for	O

to	O

upon	O

the	O

on	O
the	O

side	O
;	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
paid	O
duty	O
the	O
prisoner	O
will	O
prove	O
it	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
circumstance	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
individual	O
prisoner	O
was	O
armed	O
with	O
an	O
offensive	O
weapon	O
;	O
what	O
an	O

matter	O

my	O

this	O
