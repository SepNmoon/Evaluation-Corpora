under	O

with	O

look	O
in	O
the	O

could	O
not	O

any	O

me	O
what	O
quantity	O
of	O
that	O

edging	O
would	O
trim	O
a	O
little	O
cap	O
;	O

upon	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O

it	O
was	O

cut	O
me	O
three-quarters	O

then	O
she	O
said	O
no	O
half	O
an	O
ell	O
will	O
be	O
enough	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
cut	O
off	O
;	O
she	O
then	O
asked	O
me	O
for	O
some	O
coarse	O
cat-gut	O
;	O
I	O
think	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
yard	O

a	O
quarter	O

a	O
half	O
of	O
coarse	O
cat-gut	O
:	O
we	O
keep	O
the	O
cat-gut	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
asked	O
her	O
to	O
lift	O
the	O
parcel	O
off	O

I	O
lifted	O
up	O
the	O
counter	O

took	O
the	O

kept	O
my	O

upon	O

the	O
parcel	O

she	O
took	O
in	O
her	O

immediately	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
quick	O
motion	O
under	O
her	O
apron	O
;	O
the	O
moment	O
she	O
had	O
disengaged	O
her	O

from	O
her	O

her	O
hand	O
went	O
into	O
her	O
pocket	O
immediately	O
,	O

she	O
took	O
out	O
some	O
money	O
;	O
then	O
this	O
parcel	O
which	O
was	O
so	O
stiff	O
before	O
in	O
her	O

was	O
hung	O
very	O
carelessly	O
upon	O
her	O

threw	O
down	O
the	O

cat-gut	O
came	O
to	O

which	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
7	O
1/2	O
d.	O
seeing	O
all	O
these	O
operations	O
confirmed	O
me	O
very	O
strongly	O
in	O
my	O
suspicion	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
card	O
of	O

she	O
said	O

is	O
that	O
the	O

I	O
said	O
