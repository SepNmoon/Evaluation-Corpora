exactly	O

that	O
one	O
M'Cartey	O

he	O
not	O

that	O
at	O
a	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
by	O
the	O
gimblet	O

crow	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
they	O
were	O
bought	O
in	O
Wapping	O
,	O
and	O
mentioned	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
I	O

that	O
eighteen-pence	O

for	O
the	O

three	O

that	O
M'Cartey	O
bought	O
them	O
.	O
The	O
young	O
woman	O
being	O
asked	O
very	O
particularly	O
,	O
said	O
she	O
was	O
sure	O
nobody	O
had	O
assisted	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
robbery	O
;	O
that	O
she	O

a	O
man	O

who	O
had	O
a	O
slight	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
the	O

;	O
but	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
together	O
for	O
some	O
time	O

I	O
sent	O
to	O
Wapping	O
to	O
enquire	O
after	O
M'Cartey	O
,	O

was	O
told	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
in	O
town	O
for	O
several	O
weeks	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O

was	O
in	O
some	O
jail	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
(	O
800	O
dollars	O

weighed	O
1200	O

The	O
prisoner	O
said	O
,	O
upon	O
his	O
examination	O
,	O
that	O
M'Cartey	O
told	O
him	O
how	O
he	O
broke	O
