this	O

the	O
nature	O

to	O

it	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
take	O
leave	O
shortly	O
to	O
state	O
to	O
you	O
what	O
I	O
conceive	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
law	O
upon	O
this	O
subject	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
do	O
the	O
more	O
readily	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
honour	O
to	O
speak	O
before	O
judges	O
of	O
known	O
and	O
consummate	O
abilities	O
.	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
settled	O
principle	O
of	O
criminal	O
law	O
,	O
that	O
wherever	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
voluntary	O
felonious	O
homicide	O
,	O
without	O
provocation	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
amount	O
to	O
murder	O
.	O
If	O
it	O
turns	O
out	O
in	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
constable	O
and	O
his	O
assistant	O
were	O
strictly	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
their	O
duty	O
and	O
their	O
office	O
,	O
there	O
then	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
question	O
at	O
all	O
made	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
this	O
must	O
necessarily	O
amount	O
to	O
the	O
offence	O
of	O
murder	O
.	O
But	O
I	O
own	O
I	O
doubt	O
,	O
myself	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
constable	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
due	O
execution	O
of	O
his	O
office	O
,	O
for	O
though	O
he	O
was	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
warrant	O
which	O
authorised	O
him	O
to	O
search	O
for	O
people	O
of	O
a	O
certain	O
description	O
,	O
I	O
confess	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
that	O
search	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
who	O
fell	O
within	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
that	O
law	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
the	O
constable	O
received	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
information	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
conceive	O
a	O
constable	O
is	O
always	O
acting	O
at	O
his	O
peril	O
in	O
that	O
respect	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
doubt	O
extremely	O
whether	O
he	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
his	O
office	O
.	O
But	O
supposing	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
his	O
office	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
constable	O
and	O
this	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
his	O
assistant	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
considered	O
in	O
the	O
light	O
of	O
trespassers	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
persons	O
who	O
without	O
any	O
legal	O
authority	O
,	O
got	O
into	O
the	O
room	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
so	O
doing	O
have	O
barely	O
committed	O
a	O
trespass	O
;	O
for	O
you	O
will	O
observe	O
that	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
arrest	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
nor	O
any	O
attempt	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
made	O
before	O
the	O
blow	O
was	O
given	O
,	O
they	O
had	O
proceeded	O
no	O
farther	O
than	O
a	O
menace	O
of	O
taking	O
up	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
expression	O
,	O
``	O
you	O
must	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
me	O
;	O
''	O
so	O
they	O
were	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
barely	O
trespassers	O
.	O
Now	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
decided	O
cases	O
,	O
that	O
where	O
a	O
trespasser	O
is	O
found	O
upon	O
the	O
land	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
with	O
a	O
dangerous	O
weapon	O
,	O
likely	O
from	O
its	O
nature	O
to	O
kill	O
,	O
gives	O
him	O
a	O
blow	O
which	O
occasions	O
his	O
death	O
,	O
the	O
law	O
says	O
it	O
is	O
such	O
an	O
indication	O
of	O
that	O
brutal	O
conduct	O
which	O
implies	O
malice	O
,	O
that	O
such	O
offence	O
in	O
the	O
eye	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
amounts	O
to	O
murder	O
.	O
Now	O
considering	O
this	O
case	O
in	O
that	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
and	O
considering	O
these	O
men	O
as	O
barely	O
trespassers	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
of	O
Farmello	O
,	O
without	O
doing	O
any	O
thing	O
more	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
conceive	O
that	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
that	O
unfortunate	O
woman	O
such	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
subjects	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
the	O
charge	O
against	O
her	O
,	O
namely	O
that	O
of	O
wilful	O
murder	O
.	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
there	O
seems	O
another	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
matter	O
may	O
be	O
considered	O
also	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
supposing	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
legal	O
execution	O
of	O
their	O
office	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
constable	O
and	O
his	O
assistant	O
had	O
actually	O
attempted	O
to	O
apprehend	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
I	O
conceive	O
then	O
if	O
the	O
man	O
himself	O
,	O
whose	O
liberty	O
was	O
so	O
attempted	O
to	O
be	O
invaded	O
,	O
had	O
resisted	O
and	O
killed	O
the	O
constable	O
or	O
his	O
assistant	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
clearly	O
amount	O
to	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
manslaughter	O
.	O
But	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
great	O
doubt	O
and	O
worthy	O
of	O
consideration	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
law	O
gives	O
that	O
favour	O
to	O
any	O
other	O
persons	O
except	O
the	O
person	O
whose	O
liberty	O
was	O
actually	O
attempted	O
to	O
be	O
invaded	O
.	O
Here	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
menace	O
or	O
threat	O
against	O
the	O
prisoner	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
object	O
of	O
their	O
warrant	O
or	O
search	O
,	O
nor	O
was	O
meant	O
to	O
be	O
apprehended	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
merely	O
a	O
person	O
standing	O
by	O
upon	O
whom	O
no	O
attack	O
was	O
made	O
.	O
It	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
therefore	O
,	O
considered	O
in	O
either	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
,	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
her	O
