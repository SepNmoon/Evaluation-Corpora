at	O
Pancridge-Church	O

he	O
made	O
his	O
Complaint	O
to	O
them	O

who	O
immediately	O
went	O
in	O
pursuit	O
of	O
the	O
Rogues	O

in	O
the	O

met	O
with	O
Three	O
men	O
on	O

which	O
the	O
Gentleman	O
immediately	O
concluded	O
to	O
be	O
those	O
that	O
had	O
Rob	O
'd	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
think	O
any	O
man	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
in	O
his	O
case	O
.	O
But	O
upon	O
their	O
Tryal	O
it	O
was	O
proved	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
honest	O
Labourers	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
no	O
manifest	O
proof	O
coming	O
against	O
them	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
thing	O
being	O
positively	O
sworn	O
to	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
likewise	O
acquitted	O
.	O
These	O
two	O
instances	O
,	O
though	O
they	O
may	O
not	O
give	O
the	O
Reader	O
that	O
satisfaction	O
he	O
expects	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
condemnation	O
or	O
Execution	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
yet	O
my	O
design	O
in	O
the	O
reciting	O
them	O
is	O
rather	O
to	O
warn	O
all	O
people	O
that	O
they	O
take	O
care	O
how	O
they	O
wander	O
late	O
in	O
the	O
Evening	O
about	O
the	O
out-skirts	O
of	O
the	O
City	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
satisfie	O
the	O
curiosity	O
of	O
such	O
as	O
take	O
delight	O
to	O
see	O
and	O
hear	O
of	O
the	O
tragical	O
ends	O
of	O
those	O
miserable	O
wretches	O
,	O
that	O
are	O
the	O
Authors	O
of	O
such	O
mischief	O
.	O
But	O
for	O
the	O
satisfaction	O
of	O
such	O
we	O
come	O
in	O
the	O
next	O

to	O
speak	O
