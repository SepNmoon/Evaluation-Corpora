whether	O

may	O
strike	O
you	O

can	O

,	O
a	O
Gentleman	O

You	O
will	O
naturally	O
enquire	O
his	O
history	O
,	O
which	O
his	O
ignorance	O
of	O
our	O
language	O
will	O
prevent	O
him	O
from	O
stating	O

Permit	O
me	O
therefore	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
outline	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
reasons	O
which	O
induced	O
him	O
to	O
settle	O
in	O
this	O
country	O
.	O
In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
the	O
last	O

he	O
served	O
his	O
country	O
with	O
honour	O

colonel	O
of	O
the	O

When	O
the	O

broke	O

and	O
of	O
course	O
some	O
part	O
of	O
his	O

diminished	O
:	O
he	O
had	O
then	O
to	O
retire	O
to	O
his	O
own	O
estate	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
situated	O
in	O
Alsace	O

which	O
communicated	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
barony	O
of	O
D'Akerman	O

Here	O
let	O
me	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
Mr	O

Le	O
Cointe	O
informed	O
you	O

that	O
he	O
sometimes	O
wrote	O
D'Akerman	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
other	O
times	O
De	O

Motte	O
.	O
These	O
different	O
signatures	O
might	O
induce	O
you	O
to	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
passed	O
under	O
fictitious	O
names	O
:	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
easily	O
reconcile	O
;	O
for	O
titles	O
of	O
honour	O
in	O
France	O
differ	O
in	O
many	O
instances	O
from	O
titles	O
in	O
England	O
:	O
here	O
they	O
descend	O
from	O
father	O
to	O
son	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
enjoys	O
the	O
title	O
from	O
his	O
blood	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
it	O
belongs	O
to	O
the	O
particular	O
estate	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
who	O
is	O
the	O
possessor	O
of	O
the	O
land	O
often	O
possesses	O
the	O
title	O
.	O
When	O
I	O
say	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
mean	O
that	O
every	O
estate	O
in	O
France	O
communicates	O
a	O
title	O
to	O
its	O
possessor	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
wish	O
to	O
be	O
understood	O

that	O

lived	O
at	O
an	O
expence	O
beyond	O

the	O
natural	O
consequence	O
was	O

that	O

in	O

that	O

though	O

continued	O
in	O
that	O
character	O
about	O
twelve	O

for	O
the	O

the	O

of	O
his	O

was	O
d	O
estined	O
for	O
his	O

:	O
the	O
residue	O
was	O
sufficiently	O
ample	O
for	O
him	O

live	O
here	O
in	O

and	O
in	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O

was	O

in	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
he	O

before	O

perhaps	O
it	O
will	O
be	O

recall	O

We	O
had	O
some	O

it	O
may	O
be	O
necessary	O
now	O

me	O

the	O
less	O
upon	O

mention	O
this	O

first	O

to	O
observe	O
the	O

him	O

I	O

you	O
very	O

the	O
crime	O
with	O

the	O

the	O
Prisoner	O

the	O
crime	O
of	O
high	O
treason	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
described	O
in	O
two	O
different	O
ways	O
:	O
one	O
is	O
what	O
the	O
law	O
calls	O
compassing	O
or	O
imagining	O
the	O

King	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
adhering	O
to	O
the	O
enemies	O
of	O
the	O

The	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O
in	O
general	O
is	O
giving	O

I	O

they	O
may	O
be	O
reduced	O

four	O

The	O
second	O
is	O
,	O
collecting	O
materials	O
,	O
in	O

to	O
send	O

-	O
A	O
third	O
is	O

hiring	O

the	O
purpose	O

a	O
fourth	O

it	O
did	O
not	O

how	O
this	O

I	O
have	O

of	O
the	O
cheapness	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
I	O
never	O
before	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
Baron	O

an	O
officer	O
of	O
a	O

coming	O

never	O

of	O

to	O

to	O
deal	O
in	O

The	O
whole	O
of	O
that	O
is	O
so	O
extremely	O
ridiculous	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
read	O
it	O
in	O
a	O
romance	O
you	O
would	O
laugh	O
at	O
it	O

as	O
being	O
too	O
absurd	O
for	O
that	O
species	O
of	O

is	O
hardly	O

for	O

that	O
you	O

that	O
the	O

I	O

there	O

On	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

it	O
is	O

that	O
this	O
man	O
was	O
employed	O
only	O
to	O
send	O

which	O
the	O

most	O
undoubtedly	O
that	O

hired	O

the	O

to	O

:	O
but	O
you	O
will	O
consider	O
the	O
sums	O
which	O
were	O
allowed	O
to	O
him	O
for	O
the	O
trips	O
which	O
he	O
made	O
,	O
the	O
agreement	O
which	O
is	O
proved	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
regularity	O

the	O

of	O

reason	O
I	O

him	O
with	O
