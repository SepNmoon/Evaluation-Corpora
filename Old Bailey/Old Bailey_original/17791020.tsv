complaint	O

not	O

the	O
moment	O
I	O
saw	O
his	O
complaint	O
I	O
suspected	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
venereal	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
a	O
few	O
questions	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
convinced	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
every	O
symptom	O
of	O
a	O
recent	O
gonorrhoea	O

I	O
asked	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
contracted	O
it	O

they	O
told	O

this	O

it	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
or	O
more	O

it	O
was	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
once	O
before	O
the	O

The	O
father	O
then	O
called	O
upon	O
me	O

told	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
committed	O
for	O
a	O
further	O
examination	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
kind	O
enough	O
to	O
attend	O
;	O
I	O
enquired	O
into	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
my	O
attendance	O
;	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
difficulty	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
the	O
commission	O
of	O

;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
objection	O
to	O
attend	O
;	O
accordingly	O
I	O
did	O
attend	O
the	O
magistrate	O

Before	O
the	O
magistrate	O
heard	O
the	O
business	O
at	O
all	O
I	O
asked	O
Mr.	O
Hunter	O
if	O
he	O
thought	O
the	O
prisoner	O
would	O
submit	O
to	O
an	O
examination	O
;	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
wish	O
to	O
put	O
the	O
question	O
to	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
for	O
fear	O
he	O
might	O
decline	O
it	O

therefore	O
I	O
asked	O
Mr.	O
Hunter	O
,	O
who	O
came	O
on	O

of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Hunter	O
said	O
he	O
dared	O
say	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
should	O
do	O
it	O
or	O
he	O
would	O
take	O
no	O
further	O
notice	O
of	O
him	O
,	O
or	O
to	O
that	O
effect	O

Mr.	O
Hunter	O
had	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
to	O
let	O
us	O
see	O
his	O
private	O
parts	O
;	O
I	O
examined	O
his	O
penis	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
perfectly	O
clean	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
saw	O
a	O
cleaner	O
in	O
my	O
life	O

I	O
then	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
turn	O
round	O
and	O
let	O
us	O
see	O
his	O
anus	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
examined	O
very	O
carefully	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
clean	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
clean	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
believe	O
he	O
had	O
had	O
any	O
complaint	O

You	O
looked	O
upon	O
his	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

or	O
not	O

but	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
been	O
any	O
thing	O
there	O
I	O
must	O
have	O

it	O

that	O
circumstance	O
struck	O
you	O
as	O
material	O
?	O
-	O
Very	O
material	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
when	O
before	O
the	O

I	O
desired	O
to	O
ask	O
the	O
boy	O
a	O
few	O
questions	O
before	O
I	O
gave	O
my	O
evidence	O

I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
long	O
it	O
was	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
man	O
before	O
he	O
perceived	O
this	O
complaint	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
I	O
can	O
recollect	O
precisely	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
month	O
within	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
after	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
connected	O
with	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
his	O
perceiving	O
this	O
upon	O
him	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
he	O
lay	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
Justice	O
's	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
;	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
he	O
lay	O
when	O
they	O
were	O
together	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
then	O
he	O
he	O
lay	O
with	O
his	O

Upon	O
finding	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
clean	O
did	O
you	O
then	O
say	O
any	O
thing	O
of	O
examining	O
the	O
boy	O
again	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
had	O
examined	O
him	O
again	O
that	O
very	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suggested	O
before	O
the	O
magistrate	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O
improbable	O
that	O
the	O
disease	O
which	O
the	O
boy	O
had	O
,	O
supposing	O
,	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
venereal	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
suppose	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
now	O
suppose	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
improbable	O
that	O
the	O
man	O
should	O
have	O
given	O
a	O
disease	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
himself	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
very	O
probable	O
that	O
the	O
disease	O
should	O
have	O
subsisted	O
a	O
month	O
without	O
shewing	O
itself	O
.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
that	O
happen	O
;	O
I	O
know	O
there	O
are	O
surgeons	O
who	O
say	O
they	O
have	O
seen	O
it	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
month	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
so	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
always	O
suspect	O
patients	O
when	O
they	O
tell	O
me	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
so	O
long	O

Upon	O
this	O
occasion	O

after	O
you	O

Mr.	O

you	O
when	O

to	O

your	O

upon	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

whether	O
we	O
did	O

not	O

I	O
recollect	O
now	O
from	O
what	O
the	O

was	O
on	O
the	O
13th	O
of	O

the	O
formation	O
and	O

of	O
the	O

you	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

Now	O
might	O
the	O
appearances	O
upon	O

not	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O

it	O
appear	O

you	O
upon	O
your	O

I	O
staid	O
some	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
gentleman	O
who	O
I	O
thought	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
desire	O
of	O
conversing	O
with	O
me	O
from	O
his	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
him	O

but	O
did	O
not	O

him	O

and	O
therefore	O
inclined	O
to	O
a	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O

walk	O
off	O

him	O
take	O

went	O
towards	O
the	O

joined	O
in	O

and	O
began	O
to	O
talk	O
concerning	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O

up	O

aside	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
looked	O
