for	O
two	O
of	O

The	O
character	O
of	O

extremely	O

it	O
occurred	O

that	O

for	O

Mr.	O

and	O
if	O

would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O

he	O
would	O
show	O
him	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
if	O
Morris	O

believed	O

there	O
is	O
no	O

there	O

for	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O

sent	O
them	O
by	O
Morris	O

so	O
that	O
Morris	O
became	O
known	O
at	O
the	O

Morris	O
became	O
stripped	O
of	O
every	O

the	O

he	O

the	O
genuine	O

Mr.	O
Moore	O
by	O
Morris	O
,	O
he	O
sends	O
his	O
own	O
draft	O
by	O
Morris	O
,	O
therefore	O
Morris	O
becomes	O
known	O
at	O
the	O

had	O
a	O
reason	O
to	O

it	O
will	O

whenever	O
a	O
genuine	O

was	O
presented	O
at	O
the	O
banking-house	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
waited	O

the	O

it	O
;	O
there	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
money	O

upon	O
other	O
occasions	O

where	O
possibly	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
reasons	O
to	O

that	O

did	O
not	O

upon	O
any	O

at	O
a	O
little	O
distance	O

where	O
perhaps	O
the	O
fair	O
inference	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
an	O
opportunity	O
of	O
seeing	O
whether	O
he	O
came	O
alone	O

had	O
some	O

the	O

put	O
a	O

or	O
can	O
be	O
a	O
material	O

I	O

inclined	O
at	O

be	O
of	O

that	O
what	O
is	O
in	O

part	O
of	O
the	O

stated	O
that	O
Radenhurst	O
swore	O

it	O
can	O
not	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
possibility	O
be	O
material	O
;	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
the	O
woman	O
swore	O
before	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
admissible	O

if	O
it	O

come	O
out	O

state	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
could	O
affect	O
the	O

I	O
should	O

but	O
on	O
looking	O
over	O
the	O
short	O

,	O
I	O
find	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
such	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
but	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
desired	O
by	O
the	O
Prisoner	O
himself	O
;	O
for	O
previous	O
to	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
declared	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
that	O
supposing	O
all	O
that	O
Radenhurst	O
swore	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
true	O
,	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
amount	O
to	O
felony	O
at	O
all	O
;	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
before	O
that	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
acquitted	O
;	O
it	O
therefore	O
became	O
unnecessary	O
for	O
the	O
Court	O
,	O
to	O
watch	O
with	O
any	O
degree	O
of	O
accuracy	O
,	O
whether	O
what	O

strictly	O
admissible	O

or	O
not	O

I	O
doubt	O
even	O
this	O

whether	O
any	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
clear	O
opinion	O
of	O
that	O

and	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
that	O
on	O

that	O
that	O
