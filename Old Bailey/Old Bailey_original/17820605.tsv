Mr.	O

with	O

I	O

go	O
into	O

out	O

no	O

asked	O
Mr.	O

to	O
lend	O
him	O
his	O

which	O
he	O
refused	O

Mr.	O
Morris	O
then	O
said	O
they	O
must	O
go	O
down	O
to	O
Mr.	O

(	O
I	O

a	O

in	O
the	O

a	O

Mr.	O

I	O
believe	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O

Mr.	O

in	O
another	O

We	O
drove	O
to	O
the	O

Mr.	O

to	O
the	O

told	O
us	O
that	O
Wogdon	O

I	O
shall	O
mention	O
one	O
circumstance	O

had	O

before	O

Mr.	O

upon	O
want	O
of	O

Mr.	O

expressed	O
great	O
uneasiness	O
at	O
the	O

When	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Wogdon	O
's	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
said	O
Mr.	O
Wogdon	O
had	O
no	O
balls	O
to	O
fit	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O
's	O
pistols	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
must	O
have	O
some	O
cast	O
,	O
which	O
would	O
take	O
up	O
six	O
minutes	O
.	O
Here	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
expressed	O
great	O
uneasiness	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
coming	O
on	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
dilatoriness	O
of	O
the	O
proceedings	O

Some	O
time	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
exactly	O
recollect	O
the	O
time	O

Mr.	O
Morris	O
came	O
and	O
said	O
the	O
balls	O
were	O
cast	O

and	O
he	O
desired	O
I	O
would	O
come	O
into	O
Wogdon	O
's	O
,	O
and	O
see	O
the	O
pistols	O
loaded	O
;	O
which	O
I	O
objected	O
to	O

refused	O

He	O
came	O
also	O
a	O
second	O

and	O
I	O
objected	O
to	O
it	O
still	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
this	O

the	O
balls	O
were	O
cast	O
,	O
or	O
before	O
the	O
balls	O
were	O
cast	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
remember	O
particularly	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
proposed	O
then	O
also	O
deferring	O
the	O
matter	O
till	O
the	O
morning	O
;	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
objected	O
to	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
light	O
enough	O
to	O
finish	O
it	O
.	O
After	O
this	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
came	O
and	O
told	O
us	O
they	O
were	O
ready	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
then	O
drove	O
off	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
coaches	O
to	O
Grosvenor-gate	O
,	O
Hyde-park	O
.	O
Our	O
coach	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
went	O
first	O

We	O
then	O
got	O
out	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
coach	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
and	O
I	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
walked	O
across	O
the	O
Park	O

where	O
the	O
troops	O
generally	O
exercise	O
,	O
towards	O
a	O
large	O
tree	O

In	O
our	O
passage	O
there	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
and	O
I	O
were	O
speaking	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
.	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
mentioned	O
that	O
the	O
common	O
distance	O
,	O
from	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
been	O
concerned	O
in	O
a	O
duel	O
myself	O
,	O
was	O
twelve	O
yards	O

Mr.	O
Morris	O
said	O
eight	O

This	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
did	O
not	O
object	O
to	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
dark	O
.	O
I	O
mentioned	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
heard	O
it	O
was	O
common	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
larger	O
distance	O
,	O
and	O
advance	O
firing	O

That	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
also	O
objected	O
to	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
certainly	O
come	O
nearer	O
than	O
eight	O
yards	O
.	O
Can	O
you	O
tell	O
what	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
arrived	O
at	O
Grosvenor-gate	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
between	O
nine	O
and	O
ten	O
.	O
How	O
light	O
or	O
dark	O
was	O
it	O
?	O
-	O
It	O
was	O
rather	O
darkish	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
dark	O
;	O
one	O
could	O
not	O
see	O
at	O
any	O
great	O
distance	O
,	O
but	O
yet	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
dark	O
but	O
a	O
person	O
might	O
see	O
another	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
the	O
court	O
.	O
What	O
other	O
conversation	O
passed	O
between	O
you	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
?	O
-	O
No	O
conversation	O
but	O
about	O
the	O
distance	O
.	O
As	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
acquiesced	O
in	O
the	O
distance	O
they	O
mentioned	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
agreed	O
on	O
.	O
We	O
then	O
crossed	O
over	O
by	O
that	O
tree	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
across	O
what	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
Ring	O
,	O
into	O
a	O
place	O
called	O
the	O
Deer-park	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
about	O
twenty	O
yards	O
beyond	O
the	O
rail	O
.	O
Did	O
any	O
farther	O
conversation	O
pass	O
between	O
you	O
and	O
him	O
,	O
before	O
you	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O

I	O

When	O
you	O
arrived	O
at	O
the	O

upon	O

how	O
far	O
might	O
that	O
be	O
from	O
Grosvenor-gate	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
fancy	O
not	O
quite	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
a	O
mile	O

Being	O
arrived	O
there	O

how	O

How	O
was	O
it	O
marked	O
out	O

I	O
think	O
Mr.	O

stopped	O
it	O
first	O
:	O
I	O
stepped	O
it	O
afterwards	O
.	O
My	O
steps	O
were	O
large	O

I	O

I	O
made	O
it	O
about	O
seven	O

a	O
half	O

I	O
made	O
it	O
short	O
of	O
Mr.	O

Mr.	O

it	O

That	O
was	O
the	O
ground	O
they	O
took	O

Mr.	O
Dulany	O
then	O
loaded	O
his	O
own	O
pistols	O

I	O
mentioned	O
before	O

that	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O

pistols	O
were	O
loaded	O
at	O
the	O
gunsmith	O

which	O
I	O
objected	O

and	O
thought	O
not	O
proper	O

Mr.	O
Dulany	O
's	O
pistols	O
were	O
screw-barrels	O
,	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O
's	O
were	O
plain	O
pistols	O

If	O
any	O
thing	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
Mr.	O

were	O
rather	O
the	O
longest	O
;	O

there	O
was	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
immaterial	O
difference	O
between	O
them	O

You	O
have	O

I	O
suppose	O

had	O
an	O
opportunity	O

the	O

-	O
No	O

I	O
have	O
not	O

Did	O
any	O

at	O
this	O
time	O
?	O
-	O
While	O
we	O
were	O
there	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O
mentioned	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
cold	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
ground	O
was	O
wet	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
move	O
from	O
that	O

over	O
to	O
the	O
dry	O
ground	O

Did	O
they	O
move	O
to	O
any	O

-	O
No	O

Mr.	O
Dulany	O
objected	O
to	O
it	O

said	O
,	O
We	O
had	O
better	O
finish	O
the	O
matter	O
where	O
we	O
are	O

Then	O
the	O
ground	O
that	O
had	O

stepped	O
out	O

you	O

Mr.	O

was	O

Yes	O

After	O
Mr.	O

's	O
pistols	O
were	O
loaded	O
,	O
they	O
took	O
their	O
ground	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Morris	O
proposed	O
that	O
the	O
signal	O
for	O
their	O
preparing	O
should	O
be	O
the	O
pulling	O
off	O
our	O
hats	O

That	O
signal	O
was	O
given	O

I	O

to	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
my	O
recollection	O
,	O
after	O
the	O
signal	O
was	O
given	O

Mr.	O

called	O
to	O
Mr.	O

to	O
pull	O
off	O
his	O

and	O
he	O
would	O
pull	O
off	O

they	O
did	O

off	O
their	O

that	O

not	O

I	O
remember	O
the	O

Do	O
you	O

what	O
passed	O

upon	O
your	O
giving	O
the	O
signal	O

-	O
Very	O
soon	O
after	O
,	O
they	O
both	O
fired	O
,	O
as	O
near	O
together	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
as	O
possible	O

Did	O
you	O
both	O
pull	O
off	O
your	O

at	O
the	O

time	O
?	O
-	O
As	O
near	O

There	O
was	O
some	O
short	O
interval	O
between	O
my	O
hearing	O
the	O
report	O
of	O
the	O

Mr.	O
Dulany	O
's	O
falling	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
thought	O

at	O
first	O

that	O
they	O
had	O
both	O
missed	O
one	O
another	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
sudden	O
.	O
I	O
saw	O
Mr.	O
Dulany	O
fall	O
.	O
I	O
then	O
immediately	O
ran	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
My	O
dear	O
Lloyd	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
much	O
hurt	O

My	O
dear	O
Jemmy	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
I	O
am	O
done	O
for	O

I	O
then	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
get	O
him	O
upon	O
his	O
legs	O
;	O
which	O
,	O
after	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
him	O
up	O
,	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
walk	O
tolerably	O
strong	O
;	O
so	O
much	O
so	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
assist	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
away	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
after	O
carrying	O
him	O
pretty	O
near	O
the	O
rails	O
,	O
he	O
fell	O
again	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
hands	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
got	O
him	O
up	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
circumstance	O

should	O

after	O
I	O

Mr.	O

,	O
upon	O
that	O

expressed	O
some	O

that	O

we	O
breakfasted	O
at	O
eight	O

It	O
then	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
Mr.	O

had	O
been	O
my	O
Chaplain	O
near	O
a	O
year	O

,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

to	O
him	O
that	O
is	O
allowed	O
by	O
the	O
charter	O
of	O
the	O
Hospital	O
:	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Allen	O
,	O
though	O
the	O
chapel	O
has	O
not	O
had	O
service	O
in	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
laying	O
out	O
money	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
no	O
reason	O
why	O
you	O
should	O
not	O
have	O
your	O
stipend	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
settle	O
with	O
you	O
for	O
the	O
year	O
.	O
I	O
shewed	O
him	O
a	O

the	O
18th	O
of	O

Do	O

it	O
the	O
25th	O

as	O
due	O
on	O

He	O
breakfasted	O
with	O
me	O

As	O

entered	O
into	O
the	O

of	O

I	O

had	O
the	O

a	O
man	O
of	O
malignity	O
?	O
-	O
So	O
far	O
from	O
it	O

that	O
the	O
most	O

part	O
of	O
his	O

was	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
very	O

he	O
had	O
that	O

I	O
knew	O
to	O

him	O

Whether	O
the	O

caused	O
him	O

-	O
Yes	O

I	O
have	O
