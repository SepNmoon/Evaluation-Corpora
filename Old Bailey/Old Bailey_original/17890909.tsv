it	O
very	O

it	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
committed	O

Mr.	O

asked	O
me	O
what	O
was	O

how	O
many	O
minutes	O

Mr.	O

;	O
in	O
the	O

,	O
Mr.	O

again	O
called	O
me	O
aside	O
in	O
the	O

asked	O
me	O
over	O
again	O
,	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
prosecution	O
would	O
be	O
;	O

whether	O
I	O

the	O

him	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
told	O
him	O
she	O
would	O
positively	O
swear	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
Mr.	O
Newman	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
a	O
neighbour	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
an	O
intire	O
stranger	O
to	O
the	O
people	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
;	O
and	O
never	O

conversed	O
with	O
them	O
before	O
;	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
truth	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
advise	O
her	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
positive	O
in	O
her	O
assertions	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
she	O
did	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
serious	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Newman	O
seemed	O
very	O
much	O
distressed	O
indeed	O
,	O
and	O
mentioned	O
his	O
character	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
said	O
would	O
suffer	O
very	O
much	O
by	O
a	O
publick	O
prosecution	O

by	O
a	O

under	O

and	O
seemingly	O
underthe	O
idea	O
of	O
getting	O
rid	O
of	O
a	O

he	O
offered	O
to	O
pay	O
for	O
the	O
things	O

on	O

of	O
some	O

he	O
had	O
in	O

,	O
and	O
the	O
honor	O
of	O
his	O

;	O
but	O
all	O
the	O

asserting	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
solemn	O
manner	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
every	O
intent	O
and	O
purpose	O
innocent	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
as	O
a	O
constable	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

it	O

for	O
me	O
to	O

of	O
any	O

I	O

it	O
safe	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
any	O
;	O

if	O
it	O

,	O
it	O

himself	O

to	O
recollect	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
spent	O
the	O
Tuesday	O
,	O
assuring	O
him	O
my	O
time	O
was	O
not	O
so	O
precious	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
ready	O

to	O

the	O
man	O
of	O
the	O

Mr.	O

in	O
a	O
very	O

at	O
a	O

a	O
brother	O
of	O

in	O
some	O

;	O
I	O
can	O
not	O

particular	O
to	O
the	O
