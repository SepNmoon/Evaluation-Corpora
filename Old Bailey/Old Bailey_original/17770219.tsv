and	O
your	O

fact	O
of	O

the	O

a	O

he	O
takes	O
a	O
recognizance	O
from	O
him	O

appear	O

the	O
Court	O

acted	O
so	O
properly	O

to	O

this	O
is	O
the	O
first	O

that	O
I	O

the	O

for	O

to	O

the	O
law	O
of	O
England	O
so	O
changed	O

that	O
it	O
might	O

upon	O
the	O
discretion	O
of	O

not	O
upon	O
the	O

the	O

that	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
urgent	O
necessity	O
had	O
pressed	O
him	O
to	O
it	O
.	O
He	O

gave	O
some	O
reasons	O
,	O
some	O
tradesmens	O

I	O
think	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
to	O

;	O
that	O
he	O
meant	O
no	O
injury	O
to	O
Lord	O
Chesterfield	O

any	O
one	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
meant	O
to	O
pay	O
the	O
money	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
resources	O
by	O
which	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
;	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

it	O

did	O
not	O
pretend	O
to	O
deny	O
it	O
;	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
insinuate	O
that	O
he	O

innocent	O
of	O
the	O
charge	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
tell	O
you	O
,	O
gave	O
some	O
reasons	O

by	O
way	O
of	O
palliating	O
the	O
crime	O

for	O
his	O
having	O

this	O

Dr.	O

did	O
not	O
then	O
deny	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
applied	O
for	O
mercy	O
,	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
willing	O
to	O
make	O
every	O
restitution	O
in	O
his	O
power	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
regard	O
for	O
Lord	O
Chesterfield	O
,	O
and	O
applying	O
to	O
Lord	O
Chesterfield	O
's	O
compassion	O

hoped	O
there	O
might	O

neither	O
then	O
,	O

when	O
Mr.	O

first	O
charged	O
him	O
,	O
did	O
he	O
at	O
all	O
deny	O
the	O
crime	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
you	O
see	O
,	O
held	O
language	O

which	O
did	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
express	O

admit	O
his	O
guilt	O

This	O
is	O
in	O

of	O

this	O

Mr.	O

was	O

the	O

I	O
must	O
,	O
in	O
justice	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Robertson	O
,	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
being	O
himself	O
perfectly	O
satisfied	O
by	O
the	O
representations	O
of	O
Dr.	O
Dodd	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
bond	O
of	O
Lord	O
Chesterfield	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
more	O
reason	O
to	O
say	O
this	O
,	O
because	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
interview	O
,	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
Mr.	O

,	O
when	O

,	O
Mr.	O
Robertson	O
called	O
out	O
upon	O
Dr.	O
Dodd	O
to	O
say	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
perfectly	O
innocent	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
justice	O
to	O
Dr.	O
Dodd	O
,	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
Mr.	O
Robertson	O
,	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
upon	O
that	O
occasion	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
emphatic	O

terms	O
,	O
acquit	O
Mr.	O

of	O

the	O
forgery	O
or	O
having	O
any	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
it	O
:	O
this	O
he	O
did	O
more	O
than	O
once	O
in	O
terms	O
very	O
explicit	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
convince	O
every	O
one	O
that	O
had	O
any	O
thing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
this	O
affair	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
concerned	O
in	O
this	O
prosecution	O

that	O
though	O
Robertson	O
was	O
certainly	O
blameable	O
in	O
suffering	O
his	O
name	O
to	O
appear	O
as	O
a	O

an	O
instrument	O
