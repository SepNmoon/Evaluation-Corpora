the	O
Cause	O
of	O
her	O

.	O
It	O
had	O
penetrated	O

Shot	O

there	O
are	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
left	O
behind	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
apprehend	O
the	O
Pistol	O
must	O
be	O
held	O
quite	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
Body	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
such	O
a	O
Wound	O
as	O
this	O
;	O
for	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
two	O
Reasons	O
;	O
the	O
first	O
is	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
Pistol	O
had	O
been	O
at	O
some	O
Distance	O
from	O
the	O
Body	O
,	O
the	O
Shot	O
would	O
have	O
seperated	O
,	O
whereas	O
they	O
all	O
went	O
in	O
at	O
one	O
Orifice	O
:	O
My	O
other	O
Reason	O
is	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
Lips	O
of	O
the	O
Wound	O
were	O
actually	O
burnt	O
with	O
the	O
Powder	O
.	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
Pistol	O
must	O
likewise	O
be	O
held	O
upwards	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
Wound	O
penetrated	O
obliquely	O
downwards	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
under	O
his	O
Arm	O
,	O
but	O
even	O
with	O
this	O
