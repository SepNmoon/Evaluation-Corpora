if	O

,	O
you	O
must	O
have	O

we	O
have	O
no	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
satisfied	O
with	O
that	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
your	O
pocket	O
books	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
pocket	O
books	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
pulled	O
out	O
a	O
red	O

,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
you	O
;	O
surely	O
will	O
not	O
take	O

I	O
was	O

in	O

Look	O
at	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
and	O
tell	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
whether	O
you	O
can	O
swear	O
positively	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
committed	O
this	O
robbery	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
do	O
verily	O
believe	O
the	O
prisoner	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
committed	O
the	O
robbery	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
him	O
before	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
struck	O
with	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
his	O
saying	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
me	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
recollect	O
what	O
highwayman	O
it	O
was	O
likely	O
I	O
should	O
know	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
York	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
once	O
or	O
twice	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
of	O
doing	O
;	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
gentleman	O
that	O
was	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
sure	O
that	O
D'Arcy	B-pers
Wentworth	I-pers
was	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
kingdom	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
sure	O
it	O
was	O
him	O
;	O
I	O
knew	O
that	O
considerable	O
pains	O
had	O
been	O
taken	O
by	O
myself	O
,	O
and	O
others	O
to	O
get	O
him	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
kingdom	O
;	O
I	O
did	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
think	O
he	O
was	O
abroad	O
:	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
reason	O
to	O
think	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
arguing	O
with	O
me	O
about	O
my	O
watch	O
,	O
he	O
held	O
the	O
pistol	O
to	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
Sir	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
totally	O
unarmed	O
,	O
and	O
can	O
make	O
no	O
defence	O
,	O
therefore	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
you	O
to	O
point	O
the	O
pistol	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
he	O
turned	O
his	O
horse	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
and	O
either	O
by	O
accident	O
or	O
the	O
wind	O
,	O
the	O
crape	O
flew	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
lower	O
part	O
of	O
hisface	O
very	O
distinctly	O
,	O
about	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
his	O
nose	O
;	O
I	O
saw	O
across	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
the	O
lower	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
very	O
distinctly	O
.	O
Then	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
positively	O
say	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
?	O
-	O
Whatever	O
strong	O
belief	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
in	O
my	O
own	O
mind	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
his	O
face	O
,	O
I	O
certainly	O
would	O
only	O
chuse	O
to	O
say	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
his	O
face	O
;	O
he	O
has	O
a	O
pretty	O

as	O
you	O
will	O

You	O

in	O

of	O
your	O

,	O
a	O
circumstance	O
has	O
come	O
out	O

it	O
explains	O
what	O
you	O
said	O
of	O
knowing	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
York	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
when	O
Barristers	O
talk	O
of	O
knowing	O
a	O
prisoner	O
at	O
York	O
,	O
it	O
makes	O
impressions	O
;	O
I	O
believe	O
when	O
you	O
knew	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
visiting	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
respectable	O
house	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

Certainly	O

it	O
was	O

very	O

;	O
I	O
thought	O
him	O
a	O
very	O
agreeable	O
young	O
gentleman	O
;	O
I	O
know	O
he	O
was	O
introduced	O
by	O
a	O
very	O
respectable	O
gentleman	O
;	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
is	O
of	O
an	O
excessive	O
good	O
family	O
in	O
Ireland	O

You	O

is	O
not	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
the	O

exceedingly	O
altered	O
from	O

which	O

?	O
-	O
Yes	O

he	O
is	O
grown	O
much	O

stouter	O

opinion	O

took	O
up	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O

him	O

Yes	O

which	O
circumstance	O

I	O

made	O

much	O
greater	O
impression	O
upon	O
me	O

of	O

his	O
money	O
privily	O

I	O
state	O
this	O
so	O
precisely	O
,	O
because	O
you	O

find	O
the	O
case	O
involves	O
two	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
case	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
what	O
the	O
prisoner	O
has	O
done	O
,	O
amounts	O
to	O
what	O
is	O
commonly	O
called	O
,	O
picking	O
of	O

it	O
may	O
not	O
be	O

which	O
brings	O
the	O
prisoner	O
under	O
the	O
most	O
penal	O
part	O
of	O
this	O

;	O
you	O
will	O
therefore	O
keep	O
your	O
attention	O
to	O
these	O
two	O
circumstances	O
:	O
you	O
are	O
first	O
to	O
determine	O
whether	O

the	O
money	O
of	O
the	O

from	O

it	O

soon	O
after	O
the	O

should	O

to	O

to	O
you	O
a	O

that	O
you	O
would	O
have	O
thought	O
very	O
material	O

state	O
this	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
incumbent	O
on	O
the	O

in	O
every	O
case	O
to	O
remove	O
all	O
doubt	O

and	O
to	O

can	O
assist	O
in	O

will	O
attend	O
likewise	O
to	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O

the	O

must	O
say	O
that	O
that	O
imprisonment	O
has	O
been	O
continued	O
by	O
theprisoner	O
himself	O

to	O
your	O

that	O
you	O

give	O
it	O
no	O

where	O

that	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O

I	O
then	O
asked	O
him	O
whether	O
he	O
was	O
certain	O
that	O
the	O

in	O
the	O

led	O
us	O
to	O

told	O
me	O
I	O
might	O

for	O
that	O
