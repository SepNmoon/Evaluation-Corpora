to	O
your	O

that	O
it	O

it	O

that	O

itself	O
with	O
which	O

Court	O
.	O
According	O
to	O
my	O
recollection	O
it	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
shew	O
that	O

as	O
Excise	O
officers	O

Mr.	O

My	O

be	O
proved	O
by	O
some	O
other	O
persons	O
to	O
be	O
Excise	O
officers	O

that	O
they	O

that	O
they	O
acted	O

from	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

themselves	O

then	O
another	O
allegation	O
necessary	O
to	O

proved	O
is	O
,	O
that	O

are	O
stated	O
to	O

there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
of	O
it	O

the	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
they	O
have	O
not	O
?	O
Mr.	O
Sheppard	O
.	O
I	O
shall	O
submit	O
the	O
same	O
proof	O
is	O
necessary	O
,	O
as	O
there	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
condemnation	O
of	O
goods	O
;	O
they	O
have	O
not	O
told	O
your	O

what	O

this	O
tea	O

whether	O

place	O
without	O
a	O
permit	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
an	O

simply	O
that	O
they	O
got	O
into	O
possession	O
this	O
tea	O
,	O
nor	O
have	O
they	O
produced	O
any	O
thing	O
to	O
shew	O
your	O
Lordship	O
that	O
the	O
tea	O
was	O
under	O
condemnation	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
tea	O
had	O
been	O
subsequently	O
condemned	O
,	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
shew	O
that	O
condemnation	O
:	O
by	O
their	O
own	O
evidence	O
they	O
have	O
shewn	O
that	O
the	O
cart	O
was	O
actually	O
recovered	O
,	O

that	O
the	O
parties	O
they	O
took	O
it	O

had	O
it	O
in	O
their	O
custody	O
afterwards	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
therefore	O
warranted	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
this	O
tea	O
was	O
returned	O
into	O
the	O
Exchequer	O
;	O
why	O
then	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
the	O

situation	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
if	O
we	O
were	O
now	O
trying	O
an	O
information	O

that	O

exhibit	O
certain	O
charges	O

,	O
it	O
is	O
sufficient	O
you	O

that	O
the	O

be	O
put	O
on	O
you	O

the	O

it	O

Mr.	O

My	O

it	O

usual	O
in	O

state	O
particular	O
reasons	O
why	O

side	O

in	O
support	O
of	O
both	O

I	O

my	O

opinion	O
(	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
my	O
duty	O
to	O

to	O
your	O

)	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
is	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
the	O
weakest	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
objections	O
;	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
answer	O
this	O
by	O
saying	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
this	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
proof	O
against	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
in	O
an	O
information	O
or	O
at	O
law	O
,	O
yet	O
that	O
the	O
strict	O
rigidity	O
of	O
proof	O
is	O
dispensed	O
with	O
in	O
the	O
Excise	O
laws	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
proved	O
through	O
some	O

medium	O
;	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
on	O
which	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
ground	O
their	O
answer	O
to	O
our	O
objections	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
11th	O
of	O
George	B-pers
I.	O
it	O
is	O
pretty	O
easily	O
discovered	O
what	O
the	O
spirit	O
and	O
intention	O
of	O
that	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
was	O
;	O
it	O
sets	O
out	O
with	O
saying	O
,	O
that	O
whereas	O
it	O
very	O
often	O
happens	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
strict	O
rules	O
of	O
evidence	O
through	O
defect	O
of	O
proof	O
in	O
actions	O
,	O
and	O
prosecutions	O
against	O
persons	O
under	O
the	O
revenue	O
laws	O
,	O
such	O
persons	O
have	O
escaped	O
conviction	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
the	O
legislature	O
dispenses	O
with	O
the	O
strict	O
rule	O
of	O
proof	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
it	O
goes	O
on	O
seemingly	O
rather	O
inattentively	O
,	O
and	O
rather	O
inaccurately	O
to	O
indictments	O
;	O
it	O
goes	O
to	O
indictments	O
against	O
persons	O
for	O
rescuing	O
the	O
seizure	O
of	O
goods	O
:	O
what	O
was	O
the	O
offence	O
at	O
that	O
day	O
?	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
a	O
misdemeanor	O
,	O
a	O
common	O
assault	O
punishable	O
by	O
fine	O
and	O
imprisonment	O
;	O
but	O
then	O
afterwards	O
by	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
the	O
19th	O
of	O
George	B-pers
II	I-pers
.	O
at	O
the	O
distance	O
of	O
a	O
whole	O
reign	O
,	O
comes	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
which	O
makes	O
this	O
which	O
was	O
before	O
a	O
misdemeanor	O
,	O
a	O
capital	O
offence	O
,	O
punishable	O
without	O
benefit	O
of	O
clergy	O
.	O
Now	O
I	O
contend	O
that	O
the	O
11th	O
of	O
George	B-pers
I.	O
can	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
possible	O
construction	O
be	O
extended	O
to	O
the	O
proof	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
;	O
how	O
easy	O
would	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
at	O
the	O
passing	O
the	O
second	O
act	O
,	O
if	O
they	O
meant	O
to	O
extend	O
the	O
first	O
act	O
to	O
this	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
provided	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
all	O
these	O
things	O
mentioned	O
in	O
the	O
former	O
act	O
shall	O
be	O
applicable	O
to	O
this	O
high	O
offence	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
certain	O
your	O
Lordship	O
will	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
extended	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
;	O
is	O
it	O
the	O
bare	O
saying	O
of	O
these	O

that	O
they	O
are	O

you	O
will	O
not	O

in	O

what	O

But	O
my	O
Lord	O
,	O
I	O
humbly	O
submit	O
that	O
the	O
second	O
objection	O
is	O
unanswerable	O
;	O
they	O
must	O
be	O
unaccustomed	O
goods	O

must	O
be	O
liable	O
to	O
the	O
payment	O

can	O
the	O

upon	O
their	O
oaths	O

in	O
their	O

that	O
the	O

never	O

nothing	O

it	O

your	O

the	O

than	O
that	O
the	O
