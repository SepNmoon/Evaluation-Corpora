a	O
noise	O
above	O

that	O
if	O

the	O
best	O
way	O

as	O
the	O
people	O
were	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
house	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O

was	O
backwards	O

up	O
the	O

over	O

them	O
the	O
way	O

They	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

opened	O
from	O
the	O

where	O
I	O
lay	O
into	O
the	O

them	O
unlock	O
it	O

in	O

to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
area	O
and	O
make	O
their	O
escape	O
:	O
immediately	O
I	O
heard	O
them	O
go	O
up	O
the	O

the	O
area	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
gone	O
,	O
I	O
got	O
up	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
street	O

let	O
in	O
the	O
watchmen	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
at	O
the	O

I	O
directed	O
them	O
to	O
go	O
round	O
to	O
the	O

and	O
they	O
might	O
find	O
some	O

over	O
the	O

I	O
went	O
up	O

to	O
my	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
stay	O
long	O
there	O
;	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
observed	O
the	O

pursuing	O
one	O
man	O

but	O
none	O
were	O
taken	O
at	O

about	O
half	O

then	O
I	O
