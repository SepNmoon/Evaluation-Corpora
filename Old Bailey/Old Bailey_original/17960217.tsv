at	O

arose	O
the	O

terminated	O
in	O
his	O

I	O
think	O
it	O

in	O

from	O

relate	O
the	O

another	O

the	O

question	O
for	O
you	O
to	O

whether	O
that	O

the	O

whether	O

nothing	O
that	O

to	O

the	O

in	O
general	O
suspicions	O

can	O
have	O
the	O

effect	O
;	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
doubtful	O
whether	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
genuine	O
instrument	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
prisoner	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
outset	O
called	O
upon	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
genuine	O
instrument	O
;	O
God	O

that	O
he	O
should	O
;	O
but	O
we	O
are	O
called	O
upon	O
to	O
prove	O
,	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
something	O
which	O
partakes	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
a	O
negative	O

which	O
is	O

of	O

that	O
it	O

The	O
first	O
point	O

therefore	O
,	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
consider	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
genuine	O
will	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Lewis	O

or	O
whether	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
forgery	O
;	O

,	O
if	O
we	O
should	O
establish	O
beyond	O
any	O
reasonable	O
ground	O
of	O
doubt	O
,	O
for	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
expect	O
mathematical	O
demonstration	O
in	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
the	O
administration	O
of	O
justice	O
;	O
but	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
pronounce	O
him	O
guilty	O
of	O
a	O
forgery	O

if	O

out	O

that	O

it	O

no	O
evidence	O

that	O

that	O
Holland	O

,	O
brought	O
to	O

a	O

the	O

of	O
Henry	O

;	O
and	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
after	O
the	O

of	O
Mr.	O
Lewis	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
produced	O
a	O
sheet	O
of	O
paper	O
with	O
the	O
name	O
Henry	O
Lewis	O
written	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
Holland	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
paper	O
was	O
old	O
enough	O
;	O
you	O

the	O

of	O
that	O
;	O
that	O
the	O

four	O

if	O

upon	O
the	O
piece	O
of	O
paper	O
so	O
prepared	O
he	O

he	O
sent	O
it	O
by	O
the	O

with	O
a	O
direction	O
that	O
he	O
received	O
from	O
Holland	O
;	O
that	O
Sir	O
John	O
Briggs	O
called	O
upon	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
will	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
so	O
sent	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
that	O
will	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
that	O
the	O
testator	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
particular	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
certainly	O
would	O
not	O
have	O

that	O

Sir	O
John	O
took	O
it	O
away	O

,	O
afterwards	O
,	O
Holland	O
called	O
again	O
with	O
the	O

copy	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
could	O
find	O
a	O
witness	O
who	O
could	O
make	O
good	O
marks	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
he	O
soon	O
after	O
saw	O
William	O
Austin	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
witness	O
to	O
the	O
will	O
in	O
question	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O

knew	O
how	O
to	O
put	O
him	O
,	O
Austin	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
getting	O
100l	O
.	O
that	O
he	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
put	O
his	O
name	O
to	O
a	O
will	O
;	O
and	O
Austin	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
Holland	O
,	O
Austin	O
,	O
and	O
himself	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
public-house	O
in	O
Bath	O
,	O
where	O
Holland	O
produced	O
the	O
will	O
so	O
copied	O
;	O
and	O
Holland	O
himself	O
then	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
publishing	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
will	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
gave	O
Austin	O
a	O
note	O
for	O
100l	O
.	O
for	O
value	O
received	O
,	O
payable	O
at	O
Nando	O
's	O
coffee-house	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
that	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
afterwards	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
his	O
original	O
account	O
,	O
given	O
before	O
the	O
Mayor	O
of	O
Hereford	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
he	O
saw	O
Sir	O
John	B-pers
Briggs	I-pers
was	O
the	O
first	O
of	O
May	O
;	O
that	O
must	O
be	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
,	O
a	O
mistake	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
time	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
give	O
that	O
circumstance	O
as	O
much	O
weight	O
as	O
you	O
may	O
think	O
it	O
deserves	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
fact	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
transaction	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
month	O
of	O
March	O
;	O
Sir	O
John	O
Briggs	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
will	O
will	O
not	O
do	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
have	O
it	O
done	O
another	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
then	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
fellow	O
Holland	O
brought	O
me	O
one	O
George	B-pers
Crossley	I-pers
,	O
and	O
asked	O
the	O
witness	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
Crossley	O
;	O
the	O
witness	O
answered	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
Sir	O
John	O
Briggs	O
then	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
believed	O
Holland	O
had	O
let	O
him	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
his	O
ruin	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
that	O
Holland	O
had	O
managed	O
this	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
bungling	O
way	O
up	O
to	O
this	O
time	O
;	O
he	O
asked	O
the	O
witness	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
to	O
London	O
to	O
Crossley	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
Austin	O
would	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
that	O
Austin	O
and	O
he	O
consented	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
clear	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
month	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
mistake	O
,	O
and	O
probably	O
not	O
an	O
intentional	O
mistake	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
witness	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
,	O
that	O
Austin	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
go	O
to	O
London	O
together	O
,	O
about	O
the	O
25th	O
,	O
or	O
26th	O
,	O
of	O
March	O

from	O

the	O

this	O
evidence	O
of	O
Isgar	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
consumed	O
.	O
Then	O
,	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
material	O
thing	O
that	O
Isgar	O
states	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
Richard	B-pers
Holland	I-pers
brought	O
him	O
the	O
draft	O
of	O
a	O
will	O
prepared	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
states	O
Sir	O
John	B-pers
Briggs	I-pers
subsequent	O
application	O
;	O
now	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
confirmed	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
clear	O
and	O
satisfactory	O
manner	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
fabricated	O
draft	O
,	O
uponwhich	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
observed	O
;	O
with	O
that	O
number	O
of	O
names	O
to	O
it	O
,	O
found	O
in	O
Holland	O
's	O
house	O
;	O
that	O
therefore	O
Holland	O
was	O
possessed	O
of	O
a	O
paper	O
,	O
as	O
described	O
by	O
Isgar	O
,	O
is	O
certainly	O
true	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
is	O
proved	O
beyond	O
a	O
possibility	O
of	O
doubt	O
.	O
Another	O
very	O
particular	O
circumstance	O
that	O
confirms	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
very	O
paper	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
hand-writing	O
of	O
Isgar	O
,	O
who	O
says	O
he	O
wrote	O
it	O
.	O
Another	O
very	O
remarkable	O
thing	O
is	O
,	O
Holland	O
saying	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
paper	O
was	O
old	O
enough	O
;	O
now	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
a	O
letter	O
found	O
at	O
Crossley	O
's	O
house	O
,	O
from	O
Clarke	O
,	O
couched	O
in	O
very	O
mysterious	O
terms	O
,	O
which	O
indicated	O
pretty	O
strongly	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
engaged	O
in	O
some	O
nesarious	O
transactions	O
together	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
concludes	O
with	O
this	O
remarkable	O
expression	O
,	O
''	O
I	O
have	O
some	O
very	O
choice	O
paper	O
forty	O
years	O
old	O
:	O
''	O
so	O
said	O
Clarke	O
to	O
Crossley	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
6th	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
1795	O
.	O
The	O
other	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
are	O
so	O
unintelligible	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
ingenuity	O
enough	O
to	O
apply	O
them	O
to	O
this	O
or	O
any	O
other	O
transaction	O
.	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
find	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
the	O
other	O
correspondence	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
produced	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
between	O
Clarke	O
,	O
Crossley	O
,	O
and	O
Holland	O
,	O
writing	O
to	O
one	O
another	O
in	O
this	O
enigmatical	O
manner	O
,	O
will	O
confirm	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
Isgar	O
.	O
The	O
next	O
point	O
in	O
which	O
Isgar	O
's	O
testimony	O
is	O
confirmed	O
will	O
be	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
after	O
Austin	O
had	O
subscribed	O
his	O
name	O
to	O
the	O
paper	O
produced	O
by	O
Holland	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
agreed	O
to	O
become	O
a	O
witness	O
,	O
Holland	O
gave	O
Austin	O
a	O
note	O
for	O
100l	O
.	O
payable	O
at	O
Nando	O
's	O
coffee-house	O
,	O
for	O
value	O
received	O
.	O
I	O
will	O
give	O
you	O
unquestionable	O
proof	O
that	O
that	O
part	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
Isgar	O
's	O
testimony	O
is	O
true	O
,	O
because	O
that	O
when	O
Austin	O
was	O
apprehended	O
at	O
Hereford	O
,	O
that	O
very	O
note	O
was	O
found	O
in	O
Austin	O
's	O
hat	O

That	O
note	O
is	O
antedated	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
stated	O
by	O
Isgar	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
March	O
,	O
1795	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
note	O
is	O
dated	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
1794	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
that	O
note	O
is	O
produced	O
,	O
you	O
shall	O
have	O
the	O
examination	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
you	O
shall	O
hold	O
it	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
light	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
very	O
clearly	O
,	O
that	O
though	O
it	O
bears	O
date	O
upon	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
1794	O
,	O
the	O
note	O
was	O
written	O
some	O
time	O
in	O
1795	O
;	O
because	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
figure	O
4	O
is	O
written	O
over	O
a	O
5	O
;	O
that	O
therefore	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
written	O
in	O
1795	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
delivered	O
to	O
Austin	O
in	O
March	O
1795	O
;	O
the	O
12th	O
of	O
December	O
,	O
1794	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
it	O
.	O
That	O
part	O
of	O
Isgar	O
's	O
testimony	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
is	O
true	O
beyond	O
all	O
doubt	O
.	O
The	O
next	O
confirmation	O
of	O
Isgar	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
April	O
he	O
and	O
Austin	O
came	O
up	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
desire	O
of	O
Sir	O
John	B-pers
Briggs	I-pers
,	O
to	O
London	O
,	O
to	O
meet	O
Crossley	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
forgery	O
was	O
committed	O
.	O
Now	O
I	O
shall	O
prove	O
that	O
Austin	O
and	O
he	O
appeared	O
in	O
London	O
together	O
about	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
proved	O
by	O
the	O
person	O
with	O
whom	O
Isgar	O
lodged	O
,	O
in	O
St.	O
Martin's-lane	O
;	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
sister	O
of	O
Austin	O
,	O
who	O
will	O
prove	O
that	O
Austin	O
was	O
in	O
town	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
person	O
with	O
whom	O
Isgar	O
lodged	O
will	O
prove	O
that	O
Austin	O
came	O
to	O
him	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
there	O
:	O
that	O
is	O
another	O
confirmation	O
of	O
Isgar	O
's	O
evidence	O
.	O
His	O
connexion	O
with	O
Crossley	O
will	O
also	O
be	O
proved	O
;	O
from	O
some	O
very	O
material	O
circumstances	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
Crossley	O
was	O
seen	O
with	O
these	O
men	O
,	O
by	O
credible	O
witnesses	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
witness	O
says	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Crossley	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
expression	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
Holland	O
had	O
before	O
done	O
,	O
in	O
telling	O
the	O
witness	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
care	O
in	O
seeing	O
that	O
the	O
paper	O
was	O
old	O
enough	O
for	O
these	O
purposes	O
;	O
there	O
it	O
is	O
only	O
necessary	O
to	O
remind	O
you	O
again	O
of	O
Clarke	O
's	O
letter	O
to	O
Crossley	O
,	O
stating	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
choice	O
paper	O
forty	O
years	O
old	O
.	O
He	O
says	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Crossley	O
dictated	O
the	O
letter	O
he	O
wrote	O
to	O
Monmouth	O
,	O
respecting	O
the	O
will	O
;	O
that	O
may	O
or	O
not	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
no	O
further	O
confirmed	O
than	O
shewing	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
together	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
letter	O
was	O
received	O
is	O
certain	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
bears	O
date	O
upon	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
antedated	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
received	O
till	O
a	O
period	O
late	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
written	O
after	O
the	O
time	O
he	O
met	O
.	O
Crossley	O
in	O
London	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
actually	O
received	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
till	O
the	O
latter	O
end	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
some	O
days	O
after	O
Isgar	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
town	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
seen	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Crossley	O
.	O
Then	O
Isgar	O
states	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
have	O
500l	O
.	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
received	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
501.	O
which	O
he	O
paid	O
to	O
Crossley	O
,	O
and	O
10l	O
.	O
;	O
in	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
him	O
confirmed	O
by	O
a	O
letter	O
of	O
Crossley	O
's	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
to	O
Holland	O
;	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
states	O
that	O
fact	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
another	O
letter	O
of	O
the	O
2d	O
of	O
June	O
to	O
Holland	O
,	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
``	O
I	O
have	O
now	O
advanced	O
70l	O

So	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
proof	O
that	O
Mr.	O

paid	O
10l	O

and	O
this	O
bill	O
for	O

exactly	O
the	O

in	O
which	O
Mr.	O

himself	O
states	O

that	O

of	O

that	O

my	O

I	O

have	O

up	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
will	O
make	O
this	O
observation	O
upon	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
Isgar	O
;	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
an	O
accomplice	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
slender	O
,	O
trifling	O
evidence	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
that	O
accomplice	O
is	O
corroborated	O
materially	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
in	O
question	O
,	O
it	O
certainly	O
will	O
have	O
considerable	O
weight	O
.	O
If	O
an	O
accomplice	O
is	O
confirmed	O
in	O
certain	O
particulars	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
as	O
to	O
all	O
the	O
circumstances	O
which	O
affect	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
he	O
standing	O
uncorroborated	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
many	O
respects	O
contradicted	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	O
as	O
that	O
,	O
whether	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
Isgar	O
's	O
testimony	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
believed	O
.	O
Now	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
recollect	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
any	O
one	O
circumstance	O
in	O
which	O
Isgar	O
swears	O

respecting	O
the	O
personal	O
interference	O
of	O
Crossley	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
this	O
will	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
corroborated	O
either	O
by	O
any	O
one	O

on	O
his	O
side	O
,	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O

but	O
he	O
is	O
contradicted	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
is	O
by	O
witnesses	O
,	O
who	O
labour	O
under	O
a	O
very	O
strong	O
degree	O
of	O
suspicion	O
;	O
for	O
those	O
witnesses	O
do	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
respects	O
contradict	O
each	O
other	O
.	O
It	O
would	O
be	O
idle	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
brother	O
Adair	O
has	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
to	O
call	O
a	O
witness	O

tell	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
law	O
allows	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
admitted	O
,	O
and	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
law	O
will	O
not	O
allow	O
you	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
credit	O
;	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
tell	O
you	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
you	O
will	O
consider	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
stands	O
;	O
you	O
heard	O
the	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
gave	O
his	O
evidence	O
;	O
he	O
now	O
tells	O
you	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
sorry	O
for	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
what	O
he	O
said	O
last	O
is	O
the	O
true	O
state	O
of	O
the	O
case	O
;	O

he	O
is	O
corroborated	O
in	O
many	O
of	O

but	O
as	O
to	O
the	O

of	O

Gentlemen	O

with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
first	O

as	O
to	O
whether	O
this	O

is	O
forged	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
perhaps	O
I	O
ought	O
to	O
say	O
something	O
to	O
you	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
will	O
itself	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
seen	O
so	O
much	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
trial	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
granted	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
forged	O
will	O
;	O
there	O
are	O
several	O

who	O
do	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
writing	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Lewis	O
;	O
the	O
circumstances	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
recollect	O
immediately	O
what	O

circumstances	O
;	O
but	O
these	O
two	O
circumstances	O
do	O
make	O
such	O
an	O
impression	O
upon	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
lead	O
me	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
conclusion	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
will	O
is	O
a	O
forged	O
will	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
question	O
remains	O
still	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
decide	O
,	O
whether	O
Mr.	O
Crossley	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
forging	O
it	O
,	O
assisting	O
to	O
forge	O
it	O
,	O
or	O
in	O
causing	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
forged	O
;	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
nothing	O
but	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
Isgar	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
what	O
passed	O
upon	O
the	O
26th	O

observed	O

at	O
the	O
date	O
of	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
very	O

that	O

when	O

I	O
need	O
hardly	O
tell	O
your	O

that	O
a	O

is	O
intrinsically	O
worth	O
nothing	O

no	O

value	O

as	O
derived	O
from	O

therefore	O
I	O
submit	O
it	O

not	O

value	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O

the	O

that	O
even	O
now	O
the	O

that	O

no	O

it	O
is	O
clear	O
in	O
Hammond	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

it	O

that	O
this	O

to	O

it	O

to	O

no	O
