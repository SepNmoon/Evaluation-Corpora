to	O

when	O
I	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O

my	O
thoughts	O
was	O
to	O
trace	O
it	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
that	O
struck	O
me	O
was	O
the	O
description	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
;	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
the	O
note	O

I	O
thought	O
a	O
note	O
of	O
that	O
magnitude	O
might	O
easily	O
be	O
traced	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
enquired	O
into	O
that	O
;	O
Mr.	O

had	O
received	O
three	O

did	O
allow	O

,	O
and	O
he	O
traced	O
out	O
two	O

them	O
,	O

the	O
third	O
must	O
be	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
;	O
I	O
sent	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
stop	O
that	O

heard	O
,	O
to	O
my	O
great	O
surprize	O
,	O
that	O
that	O
note	O
had	O
been	O
brought	O
to	O
the	O

the	O
morning	O
of	O

thought	O
of	O

it	O

sort	O
