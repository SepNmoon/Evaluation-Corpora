Bartholomew	O

you	O
take	O
one	O

I	O
will	O
take	O
the	O

;	O
that	O

I	O
think	O

implicates	O
him	O
in	O
the	O

The	O

will	O
be	O
for	O
the	O

that	O

that	O

up	O

the	O

the	O
question	O
will	O

quo	O

he	O
shut	O

if	O
he	O
shut	O
that	O
door	O
with	O
the	O

of	O
keeping	O
these	O

then	O
he	O
took	O
a	O
part	O

if	O
that	O

the	O
opinion	O

there	O
will	O
be	O
very	O
little	O
difficulty	O
in	O

for	O
he	O
then	O
becomes	O
directly	O

act	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
judgment	O

is	O
answerable	O

much	O
as	O
they	O
are	O

if	O
a	O

Mr.	O
Justice	O

I	O
am	O
very	O
much	O
of	O
the	O

opinion	O
.	O
To	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
murder	O
,	O
malice	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
to	O
be	O
determined	O
by	O
the	O
Court	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
it	O
must	O
result	O
from	O
the	O
facts	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
province	O
of	O
the	O
Jury	O
,	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
a	O
Judge	O
can	O
do	O
,	O
is	O
to	O
sum	O
up	O
those	O
facts	O
to	O
the	O
Jury	O
,	O
with	O
such	O
admonitions	O
as	O
he	O
thinks	O
proper	O
;	O
taking	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
those	O
facts	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
thing	O
it	O
is	O
murder	O
,	O
taking	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
another	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
murder	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
complicated	O
case	O
of	O
law	O
and	O
fact	O
.	O
Now	O
to	O
apply	O
that	O
maxim	O
to	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
here	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
proved	O
,	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
parties	O
did	O
come	O
there	O
with	O
an	O
intention	O
to	O
settle	O
an	O
account	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
may	O
happen	O
that	O
he	O
afterwards	O
combined	O
with	O
others	O
to	O
do	O
an	O
illegal	O
act	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
he	O
shall	O
not	O
protect	O
himself	O
under	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
he	O
came	O
there	O
originally	O
for	O
a	O
legal	O
purpose	O
.	O
Here	O
it	O
is	O
stated	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
place	O
,	O
that	O
every	O
animosity	O
was	O
entirely	O
laid	O
aside	O
,	O
they	O
shake	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
supposed	O
that	O
every	O
thing	O
was	O
over	O
;	O
afterwards	O
one	O
of	O
these	O
men	O
cries	O
out	O
chiac	O
,	O
you	O
take	O
one	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
take	O
the	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
other	O
quarrel	O
,	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
fighting	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
every	O
animosity	O
was	O
laid	O
aside	O
;	O
the	O
third	O
man	O
shuts	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
keeps	O
it	O
shut	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
likewise	O
to	O
be	O
left	O
to	O
a	O
Jury	O
to	O
say	O
whether	O
that	O
act	O
of	O
shutting	O
the	O
door	O
did	O
or	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
facilitate	O
that	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
peace	O
that	O
the	O
others	O
were	O
engaged	O
in	O
;	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
,	O
that	O
will	O
implicate	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
.	O
Therefore	O
it	O
does	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
this	O
case	O
should	O
be	O
summed	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
Jury	O
with	O
such	O
observations	O
as	O
occur	O
to	O
the	O
learned	O
Judge	O

Mr.	O

Rooke	O

I	O
am	O
clearly	O
of	O
opinion	O
this	O

a	O
case	O
to	O
go	O
the	O

and	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
Court	O
to	O
decide	O
upon	O
;	O
these	O
three	O
men	O
are	O
implicated	O
together	O
:	O
the	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
how	O
far	O
they	O
are	O
implicated	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
the	O
bad	O
intent	O
was	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
in	O
view	O
;	O
one	O
cried	O
,	O
chiac	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
and	O
held	O
it	O
that	O
they	O
might	O
not	O
escape	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
clear	O
upon	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
the	O
evidence	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
a	O
bad	O
intention	O
towards	O
Wilson	O
and	O
Wakefield	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
they	O
had	O
,	O
they	O
must	O
answer	O
for	O
all	O
the	O
consequences	O
in	O
pursuance	O
of	O
that	O
bad	O
intention	O
.	O
Now	O
the	O
case	O
put	O
by	O
the	O
Counsel	O
is	O
this	O
-	O
Suppose	O
,	O
instead	O
of	O
making	O
the	O
attack	O
upon	O
Hayes	O

the	O
attack	O
had	O
been	O
made	O
upon	O
the	O
landlady	O
or	O
the	O
maid	O
,	O
would	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
murder	O
?	O
The	O
answer	O
I	O
give	O
to	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
depend	O
upon	O
what	O
the	O
landlady	O
or	O
the	O
maid	O
were	O
doing	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
:	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
sitting	O
still	O
in	O
the	O
bar	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

it	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
pursuance	O
of	O
the	O
attack	O
upon	O
the	O
soldiers	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
the	O
attack	O
upon	O
this	O
poor	O
man	O
,	O
Hayes	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
off	O
his	O
seat	O
when	O
he	O
found	O
the	O
two	O
soldiers	O
knocked	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
considered	O
by	O
Symonds	O
as	O
coming	O
to	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
the	O

for	O

him	O

The	O
case	O
in	O
Keyling	O
appears	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
point	O
against	O
the	O
prisoners	O
;	O
for	O
there	O
it	O
was	O
admitted	O
by	O
all	O

that	O

at	O
the	O

the	O

that	O

here	O
it	O
is	O
for	O

of	O

that	O
when	O

there	O
can	O
not	O

a	O
doubt	O
that	O
they	O
are	O

on	O

the	O

The	O
crime	O
with	O

is	O
forging	O

that	O

created	O
by	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
created	O
by	O
no	O

The	O
24th	O
of	O
the	O

had	O
ordered	O

to	O
be	O

the	O

found	O
to	O
be	O
open	O
to	O
considerable	O
evasion	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
the	O
36th	O
repealed	O
that	O
mode	O
of	O
impressing	O
the	O
stamps	O

To	O
denote	O
the	O
duty	O

it	O
says	O

that	O

to	O

Then	O
comes	O
the	O

any	O

There	O

no	O

that	O

Mr.	O

therefore	O
the	O
