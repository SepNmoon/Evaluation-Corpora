the	O

a	O
small	O
part	O

to	O
whom	O
they	O

for	O
payment	O
upon	O
that	O

material	O
for	O

extremely	O
important	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
the	O
letter	O
contained	O
bills	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
upwards	O
of	O
500l	O
.	O
-	O
530l	O
.	O
and	O
a	O
fraction	O
;	O
we	O
have	O
been	O
able	O
only	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
one	O
bill	O
of	O
44l	O
.	O
and	O
another	O
of	O
180l	O

both	O
payable	O
upon	O
this	O
8th	O
of	O
August	O
,	O
the	O
very	O
day	O
the	O

arrived	O
in	O
London	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
bills	O
were	O
of	O
later	O
dates	O
;	O
therefore	O
you	O
will	O
perhaps	O
think	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
fell	O
into	O
improper	O
hands	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
improbable	O
that	O
that	O
should	O
have	O
happened	O
,	O
which	O
did	O
happen	O
,	O
precautions	O
being	O
taken	O
for	O
stopping	O
the	O
payment	O
,	O
and	O
arresting	O
them	O
in	O
their	O
progress	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
never	O

hand	O
;	O
those	O

we	O

trace	O
,	O
were	O
payable	O
the	O
very	O
day	O
of	O
their	O
arrival	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
extremely	O
natural	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
had	O
the	O
fate	O
which	O
these	O
two	O
bills	O
had	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
upon	O
that	O
day	O
paid	O
.	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
not	O
be	O
able	O
to	O

clearly	O
to	O
whom	O
these	O
bills	O
were	O
paid	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
paid	O
by	O
bankers	O

clerks	O

who	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
great	O
multiplicity	O
of	O
their	O

can	O
not	O
identify	O
the	O

whom	O
they	O
pay	O
every	O
bill	O
that	O
is	O
paid	O
at	O
their	O
house	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
paid	O
them	O
is	O
important	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
that	O
each	O
time	O
the	O
party	O
receiving	O
it	O
was	O
desired	O
to	O
write	O
his	O
name	O

in	O

the	O
name	O

a	O

somebody	O
;	O
from	O
thence	O
I	O
suppose	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
think	O
it	O
harsh	O
to	O
infer	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
party	O
who	O
received	O
each	O
of	O
these	O
bills	O
,	O
was	O
conscious	O
he	O
had	O
no	O

had	O
not	O

it	O
in	O
the	O
fair	O
course	O
of	O
business	O

and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
something	O
that	O
he	O
thought	O
sit	O
to	O

;	O
in	O
each	O
of	O
these	O
instances	O

the	O
party	O

to	O

in	O
his	O

I	O
shall	O

to	O
you	O

there	O

the	O

that	O
such	O

is	O
equal	O

the	O

a	O

that	O

the	O

that	O
if	O

my	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
a	O

it	O
is	O
no	O
felony	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
certainly	O
a	O
bad	O
offence	O

and	O
the	O
parties	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
be	O
severely	O
punished	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
nobody	O
will	O
lament	O
it	O
:	O

how	O
is	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
larceny	O
to	O
take	O
place	O
here	O
;	O
larceny	O
is	O
,	O
a	O
taking	O
,	O
against	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
owner	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
my	O
Lord	O
,	O
here	O
is	O
no	O
taking	O
,	O
here	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
actual	O
delivery	O
;	O
if	O
that	O
delivery	O
is	O
so	O
far	O
forced	O
from	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
delivering	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
as	O
if	O
you	O
take	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
pocket	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
will	O
constitute	O
a	O
robbery	O
,	O
because	O
you	O
make	O
him	O
deliver	O
that	O
money	O
through	O
fear	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
humbly	O

that	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
shade	O
of	O
difference	O
between	O
a	O
violent	O
taking	O
,	O

a	O
taking	O

it	O

arising	O

to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
so	O

that	O
it	O
would	O

the	O
