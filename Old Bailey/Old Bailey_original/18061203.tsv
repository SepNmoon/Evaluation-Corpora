I	O
found	O
that	O

took	O
him	O

charged	O

of	O

in	O

whatever	O

this	O

of	O
Nardi	O
produced	O

would	O

the	O

to	O
me	O

I	O

I	O
see	O
my	O
way	O
clear	O

when	O
I	O
state	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O

goes	O
near	O
to	O
the	O
exculpation	O
of	O
Grandi	O
;	O
and	O
here	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
paying	O
my	O
attention	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
evidence	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
the	O
testimony	O
that	O
is	O
borne	O
of	O
the	O
general	O
good	O
character	O
of	O
this	O
man	O
by	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
respectable	O
characters	O
that	O
are	O
known	O
in	O
society	O

and	O
when	O
I	O
give	O
him	O
and	O
them	O
the	O
benefit	O
of	O
that	O
evidence	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
repeat	O
what	O
they	O
have	O
said	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
with	O
one	O
mouth	O
have	O
borne	O
this	O
testimony	O
,	O
that	O
his	O
conduct	O
was	O
marked	O
by	O
familiar	O
honesty	O

the	O
most	O

not	O
in	O

approve	O
of	O
him	O

himself	O

the	O
fantastical	O
conduct	O
of	O

you	O

there	O

no	O
circumstance	O

to	O
this	O

we	O
can	O
make	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
it	O
than	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
easily	O
duped	O
to	O
do	O
this	O

to	O
dress	O
himself	O
in	O
this	O
fantastical	O
way	O
in	O

You	O
will	O
recollect	O
from	O
the	O

that	O
somebody	O
did	O
call	O
out	O
in	O
Italian	O
,	O
yet	O
no	O
man	O
has	O
said	O
what	O
that	O

was	O

it	O
is	O
reasonable	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
called	O
in	O
that	O
language	O

he	O
meaned	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
to	O
call	O
his	O

to	O

agreement	O
in	O

of	O
one	O
side	O

on	O
the	O

this	O

upon	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
From	O
whatever	O
motive	O
it	O
was	O

it	O
appears	O
from	O
the	O
evidence	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
Nardi	O
did	O
inflict	O
this	O
wound	O
in	O

and	O
that	O

the	O

of	O

here	O

whether	O
upon	O

whether	O
you	O

perfectly	O
sure	O

a	O

without	O
that	O
sufficient	O
provocation	O
that	O
the	O

would	O
allow	O

or	O
whether	O
he	O
did	O
it	O
under	O

of	O

not	O

under	O

may	O

as	O
we	O

to	O

to	O

If	O
you	O
should	O
be	O
clearly	O
of	O
opinion	O
at	O
the	O

this	O
fatal	O
stroke	O

by	O

by	O
this	O

which	O
you	O
