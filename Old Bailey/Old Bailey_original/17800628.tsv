I	O
really	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
Mr.	O

It	O
was	O
the	O
tone	O
of	O
his	O

but	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
so	O
positively	O
swear	O
that	O
it	O
absolutely	O
was	O
his	O

I	O
most	O
firmly	O
believe	O
it	O

What	O
became	O

of	O
those	O

you	O
near	O
enough	O
to	O
distinguish	O
whether	O
the	O
voice	O
which	O
made	O
that	O

Duke	O
was	O
either	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
Mr.	O

of	O
somebody	O

might	O
have	O

I	O
most	O
firmly	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
voice	O
from	O
the	O
tone	O

and	O
the	O
impression	O
that	O

On	O

of	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O

in	O

the	O

marched	O
down	O
Broad-street	O
with	O
Mr.	O

Pugh	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
came	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
fire	O

which	O
wa	O

kindled	O
and	O
consuming	O
the	O
goods	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Donavan	O
,	O
I	O
halted	O
them	O
;	O
I	O
left	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
about	O
a	O
hundred	O
yards	O
from	O
the	O
mob	O
;	O
I	O
advanced	O
about	O
thirty	O
or	O
forty	O
yards	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
exhorted	O
the	O
mob	O
to	O
disperse	O
.	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
convince	O
them	O
of	O
the	O
danger	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
.	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
sheriff	O
's	O
order	O
to	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
we	O
were	O

should	O
certainly	O
fire	O
upon	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
immediately	O
disperse	O

The	O
mob	O
seemed	O
rather	O
more	O
riotous	O
after	O
my	O
speaking	O
to	O
them	O
;	O
and	O
seeing	O
my	O
admonition	O
had	O
no	O
effect	O
,	O
I	O
returned	O
to	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
of	O
the	O
Association	O
and	O
marched	O
them	O
within	O
forty	O
yards	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
guessed	O
,	O
of	O
the	O
mob	O
;	O
from	O
that	O
second	O
position	O
I	O
advanced	O
a	O
little	O
way	O
farther	O
and	O
again	O
exhorted	O
the	O
mob	O
to	O
disperse	O
,	O
the	O
mob	O
however	O
,	O
paid	O
no	O
attention	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
and	O
continued	O
demolishing	O
the	O
furniture	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Donavan	O
's	O
house	O
with	O
more	O
fury	O
that	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
done	O
before	O
;	O
after	O
having	O
desired	O
those	O
whom	O
I	O
thought	O
were	O
only	O
spectators	O
to	O
disperse	O
,	O
which	O
however	O
,	O
like	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
said	O
before	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
no	O
effect	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
to	O
fire	O
from	O
the	O
right	O
by	O
files	O
,	O
thinking	O
that	O
if	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
shots	O
would	O
have	O
dispersed	O
the	O
mob	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
pleasing	O
to	O
us	O
than	O
firing	O
more	O
.	O
The	O
mob	O
being	O
armed	O
with	O
bludgeons	O
and	O
other	O
weapons	O
,	O
and	O
seeming	O
to	O
become	O
more	O
furious	O
from	O
the	O
little	O
effect	O
of	O
these	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
shots	O
,	O
I	O
ordered	O
the	O
gentlemen	O
to	O
continue	O
their	O
file	O
firing	O
;	O
as	O
near	O
as	O
I	O
can	O
recollect	O
,	O
about	O
twenty	O
shots	O
were	O
fired	O
before	O
the	O
mob	O
dispersed	O

As	O
soon	O
as	O
the	O
mob	O
were	O
dispersed	O

I	O
ordered	O
the	O

to	O
advance	O
,	O
and	O
form	O
a	O
square	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
mob	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
fire	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
;	O
I	O
placed	O
a	O
company	O
in	O
each	O
of	O
those	O
avenues	O
securing	O
the	O

went	O

two	O
or	O
three	O
gentlemen	O
followed	O
me	O
immediately	O
;	O
on	O
entering	O
the	O

I	O
saw	O
a	O
stout	O

fellow	O
behind	O
the	O

with	O
a	O
lighted	O
candle	O
in	O
