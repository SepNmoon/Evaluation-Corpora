round	O
with	O
an	O
intention	O
of	O
going	O
into	O
the	O

,	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
I	O
turned	O
and	O
walked	O
along	O
the	O
road	O
that	O
leads	O
from	O

a	O
Mr.	O
Wood	O
,	O
a	O

I	O
thought	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
to	O
his	O

it	O
probably	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
soon	O
for	O
him	O

so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

I	O
went	O
down	O

to	O
Piccadilly	O
,	O
with	O
intention	O
to	O
call	O
at	O
the	O
White	O
Horse	O

,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
some	O
things	O
a	O
coming	O
from	O

at	O
Bath	O
to	O
know	O
when	O
he	O
might	O
expect	O
some	O
books	O
I	O
had	O
sent	O
him	O
;	O
just	O

I	O
crossed	O
over	O
I	O

two	O
men	O

a	O
woman	O
in	O

;	O
they	O
seemed	O
much	O
in	O
liquor	O
;	O
one	O
fell	O
against	O
me	O
and	O
pushed	O
me	O
off	O
the	O
pavement	O
;	O
I	O
passed	O
on	O
and	O
took	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O

one	O
of	O
the	O

came	O
up	O
