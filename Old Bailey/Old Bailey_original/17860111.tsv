the	O
most	O

object	O
that	O

conceived	O
:	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
first	O
suspicion	O
was	O
that	O
this	O

that	O

concluded	O
that	O
from	O
that	O
the	O
fracture	O
of	O
the	O
head	O
had	O
come	O
;	O
they	O
found	O
on	O
the	O
next	O

the	O
blade	O

in	O
a	O

who	O

I	O
ran	O
immediately	O
for	O
a	O
surgeon	O

a	O
Mr.	O

,	O
a	O
gentleman	O
who	O
lives	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
street	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
five	O
minutes	O
,	O
I	O
brought	O
him	O
to	O
my	O
house	O
,	O
he	O
looked	O
at	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
,	O
she	O
certainly	O
can	O
not	O
survive	O
,	O
she	O
is	O
most	O
exceedingly	O
mangled	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
kitchen	O
being	O
dark	O
,	O
we	O
could	O
scarcely	O
see	O
in	O
what	O
state	O
she	O
was	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Pooley	O
then	O
took	O
hold	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
assistance	O
to	O
remove	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
kitchen	O
,	O
to	O
give	O
a	O
better	O
light	O
,	O
we	O
then	O
saw	O
she	O
had	O
her	O
throat	O
cut	O
very	O
much	O
in	O
several	O
places	O
,	O
the	O
throat	O
and	O

were	O
cut	O
very	O
much	O

and	O
a	O
wound	O
on	O
the	O
head	O
over	O
her	O
left	O
eye	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Pooley	O
then	O
advised	O
me	O
immediately	O
to	O
get	O
her	O
to	O
the	O
Middlesex	O
hospital	O
,	O
by	O
reason	O
that	O
there	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
more	O
assistance	O
to	O
save	O
her	O
life	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
her	O
removed	O
to	O
the	O
hospital	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
in	O
twenty-five	O
minutes	O
from	O
the	O
finding	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
her	O
placed	O
in	O
a	O
bed	O
at	O
the	O
hospital	O
;	O
on	O
being	O
examined	O
by	O
the	O
surgeons	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Pooley	O
,	O
we	O
found	O
a	O
large	O
fracture	O
on	O
the	O
scull	O
over	O
the	O
left	O
eye	O
,	O
the	O
eye	O
was	O
swelled	O
and	O
stood	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
was	O
shocking	O
,	O
the	O
bones	O
of	O
the	O

were	O

very	O
much	O
cut	O
on	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
the	O

as	O
we	O
then	O
supposed	O
by	O
guarding	O
her	O
throat	O
;	O
the	O
fourth	O
finger	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
hand	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
broken	O

but	O
the	O
surgeon	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
not	O

that	O
the	O

with	O

was	O
immediately	O
concluded	O

then	O
supposed	O
some	O

that	O
she	O
was	O

finding	O
this	O

to	O

I	O
could	O
not	O

we	O
took	O
three	O

that	O

;	O
on	O
the	O
Tuesday	O

the	O
prisoner	O

Upon	O
the	O

I	O
looked	O
earnestly	O
at	O
him	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
recollect	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
his	O
waistcoat	O
I	O
observed	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
spots	O
of	O
blood	O
,	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
few	O
other	O
marks	O
upon	O

have	O
been	O
done	O
with	O
stain	O
from	O
chairs	O

they	O
were	O
red	O

it	O
was	O
easy	O
to	O
distinguish	O
between	O
these	O
red	O
stain	O
marks	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
marks	O
of	O
blood	O
;	O
I	O
likewise	O

he	O
had	O
on	O

had	O
been	O
washed	O

as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
dirtied	O
a	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
the	O
man	O
in	O
the	O

up	O
to	O
Charlotte-street	O

Now	O
before	O
we	O

this	O

will	O
you	O
examine	O
the	O
impressions	O
of	O
your	O

whether	O
you	O
recollect	O
the	O
observation	O
of	O
the	O

at	O
the	O
time	O

arose	O
from	O
what	O
you	O
observed	O

from	O
what	O
has	O
occurred	O
to	O
your	O
recollection	O
since	O

It	O
instantly	O
struck	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sight	O
of	O
him	O

at	O
the	O
moment	O
I	O

You	O

it	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
that	O
it	O
struck	O
me	O

Did	O
the	O

or	O
wholly	O
so	O
?	O
-	O
Wholly	O
washed	O

the	O

was	O
from	O

or	O
whether	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
more	O
washed	O

I	O
then	O
took	O
him	O
down	O
to	O
Bow-street	O

into	O
the	O

to	O
enquire	O
out	O

where	O
this	O

-	O
Yes	O

at	O
a	O

I	O
took	O
him	O
out	O

with	O
one	O
Pugh	O
a	O
witness	O
;	O
when	O
I	O
reapprehended	O
him	O

myself	O
scrambled	O
up	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
returned	O
to	O
Bow-street	O

we	O
had	O
a	O
long	O
examination	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
make	O
nothing	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
under	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
discharging	O
him	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
evidence	O
;	O
I	O
took	O
him	O
up	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
see	O
if	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
any	O

I	O
took	O

and	O
put	O
many	O
questions	O
to	O
him	O

to	O
some	O

that	O
were	O
very	O

some	O
that	O
shewed	O

upon	O
her	O

he	O
put	O
his	O
hand	O
on	O

and	O
shewed	O
less	O
sense	O

horror	O
than	O
I	O
should	O
suppose	O
any	O
innocent	O

my	O

I	O
do	O

you	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
I	O
never	O
did	O
you	O
any	O

I	O
said	O
what	O

I	O
then	O
asked	O
him	O
whether	O

he	O

he	O
used	O
to	O
write	O
:	O
after	O
the	O
15th	O
of	O

I	O
believe	O
he	O
was	O
never	O
out	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
better	O
and	O
worse	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
,	O
going	O
to	O

early	O
indeed	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
his	O
liquor	O
was	O
brandy	O
and	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
his	O
common	O
liquor	O
when	O
he	O
grew	O
more	O
infirm	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
equal	O
strength	O
or	O
greater	O
as	O
he	O
found	O
the	O
want	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
was	O
generally	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
incapable	O
of	O
doing	O
any	O
solemn	O

that	O
having	O

equally	O
a	O

in	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

from	O

,	O
that	O
very	O

Yes	O

Then	O
that	O
which	O

the	O
draught	O

the	O
will	O
in	O

-	O
Yes	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
some	O
little	O
inaccuracy	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
can	O
explain	O

?	O
-	O
Yes	O
.	O
Then	O
that	O
paper	O
in	O

becomes	O
the	O

Mr.	O

I	O

my	O

every	O

I	O
can	O
when	O

upon	O

therefore	O
I	O
answer	O
thus	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Garrow	O
has	O
stated	O
a	O
case	O
which	O
must	O
be	O
in	O
all	O

;	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
put	O
this	O

as	O
a	O
similar	O
one	O
to	O
Underwood	O
's	O
by	O
any	O

but	O
what	O
dropped	O
from	O
your	O

to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
authority	O
to	O
found	O
my	O
objection	O
upon	O
;	O
you	O
there	O
determined	O
that	O
the	O
question	O
as	O
to	O
competency	O
,	O
is	O
not	O
whether	O
a	O
man	O
may	O
be	O
believed	O
after	O
he	O
has	O
told	O
a	O
story	O
,	O

whether	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
legal	O
bar	O
to	O
his	O
being	O
heard	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Garrow	O
has	O
said	O
where	O
any	O
man	O
goes	O
to	O
a	O
witness	O
,	O
and	O
deprives	O
the	O
King	O
of	O
his	O
witness	O
;	O
not	O
in	O
every	O
case	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
got	O
from	O
Mr.	O
Griffin	O
's	O
mouth	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
materiality	O
of	O
his	O
answer	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
suggested	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
the	O
objection	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
an	O
expectation	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
witness	O
states	O
on	O
his	O
oath	O
that	O
he	O
expects	O
something	O
will	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
interest	O
:	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Mrs.	O
Rudd	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
heard	O
that	O
when	O
Mrs.	O
Perreau	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
examined	O
as	O
a	O

she	O
was	O
asked	O
on	O
the	O

whether	O
she	O

not	O

that	O

Mrs.	O
Rudd	O
was	O
convicted	O
,	O
her	O

would	O
be	O

;	O
I	O
will	O
put	O
another	O
case	O

which	O
appears	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
point	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
,	O
soon	O
after	O
the	O

the	O
only	O
answer	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
that	O
that	O

did	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O

;	O
I	O
am	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
was	O

to	O
further	O
the	O
conviction	O
of	O

it	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
in	O

who	O

if	O

against	O
him	O

which	O
he	O
had	O
in	O
contemplation	O

I	O
do	O
submit	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
given	O
him	O
a	O
direct	O

in	O

of	O
this	O

which	O
would	O

it	O

that	O
an	O

that	O
