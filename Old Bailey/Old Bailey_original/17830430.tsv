says	O
he	O
,	O
you	O
had	O
better	O
deliver	O

up	O

now	O
she	O
had	O

this	O

in	O

that	O

ought	O
to	O

to	O
support	O
his	O

those	O
persons	O
who	O
could	O
support	O
it	O

by	O

that	O
though	O
the	O

that	O

not	O

a	O
charge	O
against	O

the	O

a	O

neither	O

if	O
the	O

the	O

that	O

the	O

Allen	O
immediately	O
flew	O
from	O

prevented	O
his	O
taking	O
any	O

at	O
to	O
that	O

:	O
Mr.	O

had	O
now	O
very	O
little	O
doubt	O

upon	O
this	O

and	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
recollection	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

,	O
he	O
soon	O
obtained	O
it	O
from	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
soon	O
afterwards	O
discovered	O

,	O
this	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
8th	O
of	O

1782	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
it	O
contains	O
figures	O

himself	O
,	O
therefore	O
he	O
knows	O
that	O
the	O
original	O

,	O
were	O
of	O
his	O

;	O
he	O

an	O

of	O
one	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
of	O
his	O

and	O
which	O
therefore	O
must	O
be	O
made	O
since	O
the	O
note	O
was	O

,	O
he	O
says	O
further	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
examined	O
his	O
books	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
appears	O
from	O

that	O

not	O
any	O
such	O

as	O

on	O

therefore	O
this	O
can	O
not	O
be	O

a	O
true	O
note	O
,	O
but	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
altered	O
from	O

for	O
two	O
reasons	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
himself	O
made	O
it	O
and	O
issued	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
alone	O
is	O
decisive	O
if	O
it	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
other	O
reason	O
is	O
,	O
because	O
there	O
appears	O
to	O
be	O
no	O
note	O
of	O
that	O
date	O
of	O
1245	O
;	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
know	O
who	O
made	O
out	O
the	O
other	O
notes	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
knows	O
there	O
were	O

and	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
note	O
K	B-pers
.	I-pers
1210	O
;	O
therefore	O
he	O
supposes	O
there	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
addition	O
of	O
a	O
figure	O
of	O
one	O
in	O
that	O
note	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
says	O
also	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
note	O
K	B-pers

1152	O
issued	O
but	O
no	O
note	O
of	O
K	B-pers

11152	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
further	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
such	O
note	O
as	O
that	O
last	O
issued	O
by	O
circumstance	O
of	O
the	O
alteration	O
of	O
the	O
figure	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
giving	O
no	O
account	O
how	O
he	O
came	O
by	O
these	O
notes	O
;	O
that	O
he	O

a	O
possibility	O

to	O
him	O

by	O
two	O

in	O
the	O

that	O

that	O

the	O
tendency	O
of	O

of	O
Mrs.	O
Leach	O
.	O
In	O
almost	O
every	O
case	O
that	O
comes	O
before	O
you	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
strict	O
possibility	O
where	O
the	O
positive	O
fact	O
itself	O
is	O
not	O
proved	O
by	O
witnesses	O
,	O
who	O
saw	O
the	O
fact	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
strict	O
possibility	O
,	O
that	O
somebody	O
else	O
might	O
have	O
committed	O
it	O
:	O
But	O
that	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
evidence	O
requires	O
,	O
that	O
Juries	O
should	O
not	O
govern	O
themselves	O
,	O
in	O
questions	O
of	O
evidence	O
,	O
that	O
come	O
before	O
them	O
,	O
by	O
that	O
strictness	O
,	O
is	O
most	O
evident	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
possible	O
that	O
offenders	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
should	O
be	O
brought	O
to	O
Justice	O
.	O
Where	O
there	O
is	O
reasonable	O
probability	O
,	O
that	O
not	O
withstanding	O
the	O
appearances	O
a	O
man	O
may	O
be	O
innocent	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
fair	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
of	O
them	O
:	O
But	O
if	O
it	O
goes	O
further	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
there	O
is	O
nothing	O
but	O
absolute	O
possibility	O
,	O
where	O
all	O
the	O
moral	O
probabilities	O
of	O
evidence	O
are	O
against	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
where	O
nothing	O
can	O
save	O
but	O
absolute	O
possibility	O
that	O
he	O
may	O
be	O
innocent	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
going	O
too	O
far	O
to	O
conclude	O
him	O
innocent	O
from	O
that	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
make	O
it	O
impossible	O
that	O
public	O
Justice	O
should	O
take	O
its	O
course	O

Therefore	O
,	O
the	O
true	O
question	O
for	O
your	O

that	O

then	O
the	O

is	O
guilty	O

and	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
your	O
duty	O

on	O
