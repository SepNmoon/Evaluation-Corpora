that	O

on	O
that	O

the	O

on	O
which	O
the	O

another	O
circumstance	O
that	O

this	O

a	O
few	O
minutes	O
before	O

on	O
Sir	O
Thomas	B-pers

,	O
these	O
two	O
men	O
were	O
seen	O
on	O
that	O
road	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
therefore	O
be	O
to	O
judge	O
,	O
whether	O
or	O
no	O
these	O
are	O
,	O
or	O
are	O
not	O
the	O
men	O
that	O
committed	O
the	O

,	O
you	O
will	O
judge	O
by	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
the	O
place	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
above	O
forty	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
Wood	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
exactly	O
seven	O

therefore	O
it	O
is	O
possible	O
he	O

gone	O
from	O
his	O
house	O
at	O
four	O

and	O
returned	O
at	O
six	O

therefore	O
the	O
only	O
question	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
will	O
be	O
between	O
the	O
hours	O
of	O

you	O
will	O

your	O

from	O
the	O
hour	O

if	O

you	O
will	O
conceive	O

,	O
and	O
he	O
pulled	O
it	O
up	O

it	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
held	O
it	O
at	O
a	O
little	O

from	O
his	O

that	O

position	O
as	O
to	O
see	O
whether	O
any	O

was	O
concealed	O

not	O
,	O
therefore	O
I	O

he	O

observed	O
my	O

the	O

said	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
to	O

something	O

and	O
he	O
called	O
to	O

come	O
here	O

my	O

out	O

it	O
struck	O
me	O
so	O
forcibly	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
observed	O
their	O
height	O

one	O
was	O
about	O
five	O

now	O
that	O

the	O

My	O
Lord	O

I	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
principle	O

and	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
practice	O
of	O
the	O

of	O

that	O
all	O

may	O
be	O

to	O

by	O
your	O

many	O

no	O
point	O
will	O
be	O
pressed	O
against	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
am	O
perfectly	O
convinced	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
this	O
case	O
depends	O
on	O
the	O
question	O
,	O
whether	O
half	O
an	O
inch	O
or	O
a	O
quarter	O
of	O
an	O

of	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
am	O
to	O
address	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
law	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
endeavour	O
to	O
confine	O
myself	O
very	O
strictly	O
to	O
that	O
question	O
:	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
stating	O
with	O
great	O
submission	O
,	O
that	O
according	O
to	O
the	O
ancient	O
common	O
law	O
notion	O
of	O
burglary	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
indispensibly	O
necessary	O
that	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
breaking	O
,	O
accompanied	O
by	O
an	O
actual	O
entry	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
ancient	O
common	O
law	O
of	O
England	O
;	O
the	O
reason	O
that	O
burglary	O
is	O
considered	O
as	O
an	O
offence	O
highly	O
criminal	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
invasion	O
of	O
the	O
security	O
of	O
the	O
subject	O
in	O
his	O
castle	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
aware	O
that	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
some	O
determinations	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
that	O
ancient	O
principle	O
has	O
certainly	O
been	O
considered	O
with	O
a	O
degree	O
of	O
latitude	O
in	O
the	O
construction	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
always	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
determinations	O
of	O
the	O
Judges	O
,	O
in	O
questions	O
of	O
life	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
aware	O
of	O
those	O
decisions	O
which	O
hold	O
,	O
that	O
where	O
a	O
pane	O
of	O
glass	O
is	O
broken	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
instrument	O
introduced	O
noctanter	O
,	O
that	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
burglary	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
I	O
may	O
say	O
without	O
offence	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
very	O
great	O
authorities	O

who	O
wish	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
new	O
question	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
so	O
held	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
all	O
these	O
new	O
determinations	O
is	O
this	O

there	O
is	O
such	O
a	O
breaking	O
of	O

his	O

may	O
be	O
taken	O
out	O

I	O
take	O
the	O
principle	O
of	O
those	O
determinations	O
,	O
which	O
speaks	O
of	O
an	O
instrument	O
introduced	O

to	O
mean	O
not	O
the	O
instrument	O
by	O
which	O
the	O

an	O

here	O
the	O
introduction	O
of	O
the	O

part	O
of	O
the	O

no	O
man	O

can	O
say	O

that	O
this	O
