,	O
that	O
the	O
indictment	O

upon	O
the	O
face	O

Mr.	O

,	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O

relied	O

to	O
support	O
the	O
objection	O

to	O
the	O
indictment	O

The	O
indictment	O
in	O
that	O

in	O
breaking	O
the	O

commanding	O
the	O

did	O
not	O

the	O

decision	O

that	O

,	O
the	O
command	O
precedes	O

the	O
averment	O

The	O

made	O
objections	O

first	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

was	O

compleated	O
,	O
because	O
it	O

not	O

,	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
transfer	O
to	O
Harrison	O
;	O
and	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
transfer	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
made	O
or	O
attempted	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
and	O
his	O
son	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
valid	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
attested	O
by	O
any	O
witness	O
.	O
These	O
two	O
questions	O
were	O
argued	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Jackson	O
,	O
on	O
behalf	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
before	O
all	O
the	O
Judges	O
.	O
The	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
observed	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
transfer	O
of	O
the	O
stock	O
made	O
to	O
William	B-pers
Harrison	I-pers
was	O
not	O
accepted	O
by	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
contended	O
that	O
William	B-pers
Harrison	I-pers
was	O
not	O
the	O
proprietor	O
,	O
nor	O
capable	O
of	O
transferring	O
the	O
stock	O
.	O
But	O
to	O
this	O
there	O
are	O
two	O
answers	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
transfer	O
the	O
property	O
did	O
vest	O
in	O
William	B-pers
Harrison	I-pers
;	O
and	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
died	O
before	O
he	O
had	O
accepted	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
stock	O
would	O
have	O
gone	O
to	O
his	O
executors	O
,	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
personal	O
estate	O
;	O
secondly	O
,	O
if	O
William	B-pers
Harrison	I-pers
had	O
no	O
stock	O
,	O
that	O
would	O
not	O
vary	O
this	O
case	O
;	O
for	O
the	O

forged	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
is	O
compleat	O
on	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
it	O
imports	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
such	O
stock	O
to	O
be	O
transferred	O
;	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
stock	O
in	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
William	B-pers
Harrison	I-pers
the	O
attempt	O
to	O
transfer	O
such	O
stock	O
is	O
more	O
daring	O

impudent	O
,	O
but	O
neither	O
the	O

or	O
the	O

are	O
less	O

The	O
other	O
objection	O
was	O

that	O
the	O
signing	O
of	O
a	O

the	O

the	O

we	O

agreed	O
he	O
might	O
be	O

,	O
in	O
stealing	O
the	O

they	O

he	O

this	O

before	O

so	O
he	O
was	O
indicted	O
;	O
and	O

I	O
told	O
my	O
Lord	O

what	O
we	O

Now	O
that	O

no	O

for	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
not	O
indicted	O
a	O
second	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
burglary	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
merely	O
a	O
direction	O
from	O
the	O
Judges	O
to	O
the	O
officer	O
of	O
the	O
Court	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
second	O
indictment	O

and	O
it	O
proceeded	O
upon	O
a	O
mistake	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
shall	O
shew	O
presently	O
.	O
If	O
the	O
Judges	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
exercised	O
a	O
little	O
lenity	O
before	O
the	O
indictment	O
,	O
which	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
more	O
properly	O
done	O
after	O
the	O
conviction	O
,	O
much	O
censure	O
could	O
not	O
fall	O
on	O
them	O
;	O
but	O
they	O
proceeded	O
on	O
the	O
ground	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
having	O
been	O
indicted	O
of	O
burglary	O
,	O
in	O
breaking	O
the	O
house	O
of	O
Mr.	O

he	O
could	O
not	O

,	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
indicted	O
for	O
stealing	O
the	O
money	O
of	O
Hill	O
.	O
So	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
the	O
Judges	O
went	O
upon	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
the	O
breaking	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
stealing	O
the	O
goods	O
were	O
two	O
distinct	O
offences	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
breaking	O
the	O

only	O
constituted	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
burglary	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
manifest	O
mistake	O
;	O
it	O
consisted	O
of	O
breaking	O
the	O
house	O

stealing	O
the	O
goods	O

and	O
if	O
stealing	O
the	O
goods	O
of	O

was	O
a	O
dictinct	O

from	O
stealing	O

it	O

for	O
stealing	O
the	O
money	O
of	O
Tryon	O
,	O
and	O
breaking	O
his	O
house	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
's	O
life	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
jeopardy	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
the	O
Judges	O
held	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
be	O
tried	O
for	O
stealing	O
the	O

and	O
if	O

convicted	O
upon	O
this	O
indictment	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
the	O
verdict	O
,	O
two	O
objections	O
were	O
made	O
by	O
the	O
Counsel	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
First	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
statute	O
did	O
not	O
extend	O
to	O
any	O
case	O
in	O
which	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
actual	O
escape	O
,	O
And	O
secondly	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
indictment	O
,	O
upon	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
was	O
informal	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
,	O
in	O
words	O
,	O
state	O
that	O
Isdwell	O
ever	O
attempted	O
to	O
make	O
his	O
escape	O
.	O
These	O
two	O
questions	O
have	O
been	O
argued	O
very	O
fully	O
before	O
all	O
the	O
Judges	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
that	O
argument	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Knowlys	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prisoners	O
,	O
relied	O
upon	O
a	O
case	O
reported	O
in	O
Keilwey	O
,	O
87.	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
objection	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
to	O
the	O
indictment	O
.	O
The	O
indictment	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
was	O
for	O
felony	O
,	O
in	O
breaking	O
the	O
prison	O
,	O
and	O
abetting	O
and	O
commanding	O
the	O
prisoner	O
to	O
go	O
at	O
large	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
state	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
actually	O
did	O
go	O
at	O
large	O
.	O
The	O
decision	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
escape	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
felony	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
abetting	O
and	O
commanding	O
did	O
not	O
import	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
escape	O
;	O
but	O
upon	O
this	O
case	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
observed	O
,	O
that	O
abetting	O
and	O
commanding	O
to	O
do	O
an	O
act	O
are	O
very	O
different	O
from	O
aiding	O
and	O
assisting	O
in	O
the	O
act	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
that	O
case	O
will	O
not	O
govern	O
the	O
present	O
;	O
a	O
man	O
may	O
command	O
another	O
to	O
do	O
an	O
act	O
which	O
is	O
never	O
done	O
;	O
where	O
the	O
act	O
is	O
done	O
,	O
the	O
command	O
precedes	O
the	O
act	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
averment	O
of	O
a	O
command	O
does	O
not	O
simply	O
a	O
subsequent	O
execution	O
of	O
that	O
demand	O
;	O
but	O
no	O
man	O
can	O
aid	O
or	O
assist	O
another	O
in	O
an	O
act	O
unless	O
the	O
act	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
averment	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
aided	O
and	O
assisted	O
in	O
the	O
attempt	O
necessarily	O
implies	O
that	O
the	O
attempt	O
was	O
made	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
make	O
sense	O
of	O

to	O

the	O

it	O
proceeded	O

If	O
the	O
Judges	O
in	O

a	O
little	O

So	O
in	O
that	O

the	O

goods	O
were	O
two	O

is	O

it	O
consisted	O
