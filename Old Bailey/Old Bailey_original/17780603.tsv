I	O
went	O

called	O
out	O

My	O
first	O
idea	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
my	O
lawyer	O
;	O
I	O
recollected	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
weak	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
him	O
money	O
,	O
for	O
before	O
I	O
parted	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
be	O

remember	O
you	O
have	O

me	O

you	O
come	O
,	O
remember	O
you	O
have	O

I	O
went	O
part	O

the	O
way	O
next	O

to	O
my	O
attorney	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
upon	O
reflecting	O
how	O
weak	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
better	O
to	O
comply	O
with	O
my	O
appointment	O
;	O
accordingly	O
I	O
wrapped	O
up	O
five	O
guineas	O
in	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
paper	O
;	O
I	O
passed	O
the	O

looked	O
into	O
it	O

and	O
turned	O
up	O
a	O
little	O
alley	O
;	O
he	O
presently	O
followed	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
gave	O
him	O
the	O
five	O
guineas	O
.	O
Sir	O
,	O
said	O
I	O
,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
wretched	O
way	O
of	O
getting	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
wretched	O
fool	O
for	O

it	O
you	O

as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
fool	O
in	O
the	O
first	O

,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
must	O
pay	O
for	O
my	O
folly	O
;	O
he	O
received	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
thanks	O
;	O
he	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
shillings	O
to	O
buy	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
breeches	O
;	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
extremely	O
poor	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
manner	O
of	O
living	O

his	O
creditors	O
were	O
numerous	O

he	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
this	O

I	O
said	O

I	O

a	O

would	O

asked	O
me	O
