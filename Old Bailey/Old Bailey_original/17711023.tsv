the	O

on	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
about	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O

came	O
for	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
gone	O

I	O
cedded	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
wound	O
;	O
upon	O
drawing	O
up	O
his	O

I	O
found	O
a	O
wound	O
a	O
full	O
inch	O
in	O
length	O
passing	O
from	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
spine	O
,	O
evidently	O
made	O
with	O
a	O
cutting	O
instrument	O

Q	O

Do	O
you	O
mean	O
a	O
pointed	O
as	O
well	O

cutting	O
instrument	O
?	O
Jessamin	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
hardly	O
possible	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
breadth	O
of	O
the	O
wound	O
.	O
The	O
wound	O
passed	O
across	O
from	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
to	O
the	O
left	O
,	O
where	O
it	O
went	O
in	O
to	O
a	O
considerable	O
depth	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
dilate	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
immediately	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
to	O
discover	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
injury	O
;	O
with	O
my	O
finger	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O
rib	O
bare	O
at	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
wound	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
prodigious	O
quantity	O
of	O
blood	O
flowing	O
from	O
the	O
wound	O
;	O
from	O
which	O
circumstances	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
depth	O
of	O
the	O
wound	O
.	O
I	O
judged	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
have	O
penetrated	O
the	O
cavity	O
of	O
the	O
chest	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
certain	O
of	O
this	O
point	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
.	O
I	O
desired	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
instrument	O
with	O
which	O
the	O
wound	O
was	O
inflicted	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
might	O
form	O
some	O
prognostic	O
from	O
that	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
produced	O
at	O
that	O

saw	O
the	O

again	O

was	O
a	O
cut	O
in	O
his	O
coat	O

corresponding	O
to	O
the	O
wound	O
.	O
I	O
attended	O
him	O
regularly	O
,	O
and	O
finding	O
his	O
pulse	O
raged	O
,	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
bleed	O
him	O
and	O
keep	O
him	O
low	O

I	O
imagined	O
there	O
was	O
mischief	O
within	O

In	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
treatment	O
,	O
I	O
separated	O
some	O
splinters	O
of	O
bone	O
that	O
I	O
found	O
loose	O
in	O
the	O
wound	O

On	O
the	O
Friday	O
after	O

received	O
the	O
