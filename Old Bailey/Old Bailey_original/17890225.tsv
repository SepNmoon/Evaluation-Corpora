I	O

it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
29th	O

the	O
day	O

He	O
came	O

enquired	O
for	O
Mr.	O
Young	O
,	O
who	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
home	O
;	O
therefore	O
the	O
servant	O
called	O
me	O
to	O
him	O

he	O
wished	O
to	O
dispose	O
of	O
the	O

who	O
died	O

it	O
was	O
a	O
female	O

she	O
had	O
been	O
with	O
him	O
eleven	O

twelve	O

the	O

had	O
refused	O

he	O

it	O

right	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
get	O
something	O
for	O
her	O
body	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
afford	O
to	O

her	O
himself	O

was	O
about	O

about	O
six	O

saw	O
the	O

not	O

it	O

I	O
never	O

him	O

that	O

that	O

the	O

transaction	O
respecting	O
the	O

at	O

told	O
me	O
that	O
the	O

brought	O
to	O

about	O
two	O

on	O

with	O
very	O

the	O

found	O
a	O

that	O

Gentlemen	O
you	O
would	O
naturally	O

thought	O
she	O

now	O
got	O
rid	O
of	O
these	O

she	O
was	O
bitterly	O
disappointed	O

for	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
her	O
house	O

made	O
disturbances	O
there	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

there	O

done	O

before	O

it	O

of	O
the	O

a	O
certain	O
sum	O

her	O

who	O
knew	O
herself	O
very	O
little	O
of	O

I	O
dare	O

that	O
if	O
the	O

was	O
taken	O
up	O
for	O
those	O
costs	O

they	O
would	O
feel	O
it	O
in	O

as	O
to	O

them	O
to	O
desist	O
in	O

from	O
such	O
an	O
interruption	O

I	O

on	O
this	O

such	O

by	O
the	O

it	O
was	O

an	O

some	O

in	O
the	O

December	O
we	O
issued	O
a	O

Lady	O
Juliana	O
at	O
first	O
did	O
not	O

it	O

this	O
miserable	O

woman	O
for	O
the	O

she	O
did	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
means	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
nuisance	O
?	O
-	O
We	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
her	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
.	O
Had	O
you	O
any	O
conversation	O
with	O
the	O

after	O
the	O
arrest	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
know	O
nothing	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
she	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

all	O

she	O
has	O
claimed	O
a	O

due	O
to	O
her	O
from	O
Lady	O
Juliana	O
as	O
executrix	O
;	O
and	O
after	O
this	O

another	O

in	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

I	O
understand	O
from	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
poor	O
woman	O
being	O
troublesome	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
sent	O
to	O

for	O

-	O
Yes	O
.	O
And	O
this	O
woman	O
being	O
troublesome	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
indicted	O
for	O
the	O
perjury	O
?	O
-	O
To	O
be	O
sure	O
.	O
That	O
is	O
the	O
history	O
of	O

I	O
believe	O
?	O
-	O
Compassion	O
might	O
have	O
induced	O
Lady	O
Juliana	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
troublesome	O
.	O
You	O
never	O
understood	O
she	O
had	O
any	O
other	O
demand	O
?	O
-	O
She	O
always	O
pretended	O
that	O
the	O
judgment	O
Lady	O
Howard	O
had	O
recovered	O
against	O
her	O
was	O
for	O
want	O
of	O
assets	O
;	O
therefore	O
she	O
must	O
continue	O
that	O
demand	O
against	O
her	O
executrix	O
.	O
Do	O
you	O
look	O
upon	O
her	O
as	O
a	O
mad-woman	O
?	O
-	O
I	O
do	O
not	O

;	O
her	O
conduct	O

certainly	O
curious	O

Mr.	O

She	O
has	O
often	O
insisted	O
on	O
her	O
former	O
demand	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
thought	O
her	O
defeat	O
arose	O
from	O
want	O
of	O

?	O
-	O
Yes	O

My	O
learned	O

that	O
because	O
that	O

it	O
was	O
in	O
the	O

her	O
for	O
the	O

clearly	O

Out	O
of	O
