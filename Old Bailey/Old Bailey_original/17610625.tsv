with	O
him	O
;	O
Dr.	O

I	O
was	O
introduced	O

as	O
a	O
person	O
sent	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Brice	O
;	O
he	O
received	O
me	O
with	O
great	O
satisfaction	O
;	O
I	O
thought	O

satisfaction	O

received	O
me	O
with	O
kindness	O

Mr.	O

This	O

Was	O
he	O
sensible	O

I	O

before	O
that	O
time	O
dressed	O
by	O
the	O
surgeons	O
that	O
attended	O
him	O

so	O
that	O
I	O
only	O
felt	O
his	O

and	O
asked	O
him	O
a	O

questions	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O

Then	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
with	O

who	O
had	O
attended	O
him	O
before	O
,	O
to	O
be	O
particularly	O
informed	O
.	O
It	O
appeared	O
unnecessary	O
to	O
vary	O
the	O
method	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
agreed	O
to	O
meet	O
again	O
that	O
night	O
at	O
ten	O
o'clock	O

Dr.	O

proposed	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
some	O
questions	O
relative	O

were	O
asked	O
him	O

answers	O
were	O
much	O
the	O

as	O

observed	O
,	O
when	O
the	O

asked	O
him	O
if	O
Mr.	O
Brice	O
was	O
the	O
aggressor	O

looked	O
up	O
with	O

No	O

I	O
was	O

He	O
spoke	O
it	O
with	O
such	O
particular	O
emphasis	O
,	O
that	O
conveyed	O
more	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
mere	O
words	O
.	O
It	O
was	O
spoke	O
with	O
great	O
earnestness	O
.	O
I	O
observed	O
his	O
countenance	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
exceedingly	O
expressive	O
;	O
he	O
confirmed	O
by	O
his	O
looks	O

seemed	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
understood	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
