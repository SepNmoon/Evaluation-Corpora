that	O

nothing	O

nothing	O

therefore	O
,	O
the	O
enquiry	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O

was	O
to	O

how	O
far	O
we	O
could	O
,	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
support	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
assertion	O
contained	O
in	O
the	O
memorial	O
;	O
we	O
made	O
enquiries	O
,	O
and	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
owing	O
to	O
a	O
great	O
number	O
of	O
persons	O
being	O
creditors	O
,	O
or	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
the	O
affection	O
that	O
the	O
people	O
in	O
that	O
neighbourhood	O
have	O
for	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
this	O
respectable	O
gentleman	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
considerable	O
difficulty	O
in	O
procuring	O
any	O
intelligence	O
;	O
it	O
then	O
became	O
a	O
question	O
,	O
not	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
these	O
receipts	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
found	O
among	O
Mr.	O
Collinridge	O
's	O
papers	O
,	O
whether	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
proper	O
that	O
this	O
prosecution	O
should	O
be	O
instituted	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
exercise	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
direction	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
should	O
not	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
so	O
felt	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
proper	O
to	O
give	O
Mr.	O
Thomas	B-pers
the	O
earliest	O
intelligence	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
intention	O
of	O
the	O
Navy	O

to	O
prosecute	O
him	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
hardly	O
given	O
this	O
pleasing	O
information	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Thomas	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
procured	O
intelligence	O
of	O
extreme	O
importance	O

which	O
will	O
be	O
laid	O
before	O

,	O
upon	O

he	O
says	O
to	O
Mr.	O

this	O
can	O
not	O

I	O

With	O

I	O
should	O

to	O

though	O
Mr.	O

might	O
believe	O
that	O
these	O

were	O
so	O
actually	O

no	O
man	O
can	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
obtaining	O

would	O
amount	O
to	O
the	O
