the	O
4th	O
of	O
October	O

,	O
I	O
shall	O
be	O
able	O
to	O

by	O
the	O
testimony	O
of	O
a	O
Mr.	O
Watman	O
,	O
an	O
eminent	O
paper-maker	O
,	O

I	O
should	O
rather	O
you	O
would	O
hear	O
from	O
him	O
the	O
manner	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
distinguishes	O
it	O

which	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

the	O

of	O

by	O

the	O

it	O
is	O

times	O
;	O
Mr.	O

then	O
is	O
the	O
result	O
?	O
Here	O
is	O
a	O
bill	O
dated	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
October	O
1780	O
,	O
written	O
upon	O
paper	O
which	O
did	O
not	O
exist	O
till	O
the	O
17th	O
of	O
May	O
1782	O
:	O
Then	O
can	O
that	O
be	O
genuine	O
?	O
If	O
it	O
stood	O
on	O
the	O
paper	O
only	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
decisive	O
piece	O
of	O
evidence	O
;	O
that	O
that	O
bill	O
is	O
not	O
genuine	O
;	O
for	O
if	O
that	O
paper	O
did	O
not	O
exist	O
till	O
May	O
1783	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
any	O
bill	O
of	O
exchange	O
should	O
be	O
written	O
upon	O
that	O
so	O
early	O
as	O
October	O
1780	O
;	O
to	O
suppose	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
genuine	O
bill	O
,	O
that	O
paper	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
here	O
early	O
enough	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
sent	O
to	O
India	O
,	O
previous	O
to	O
that	O
date	O
:	O
Now	O
the	O
paper	O
maker	O
says	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
mould	O
did	O
not	O
exist	O
,	O
or	O
was	O
not	O
used	O
till	O
after	O
that	O
time	O
;	O
if	O
therefore	O
you	O
are	O
satisfied	O
of	O
that	O
fact	O
,	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
no	O
doubt	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
papers	O
now	O
produced	O
is	O
the	O
false	O
one	O
:	O
The	O
first	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
call	O
the	O
true	O
bill	O
,	O
was	O
received	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Archibald	B-pers
Campbell	I-pers
from	O
India	O
,	O
accepted	O
by	O
the	O
Company	O
about	O
the	O
29th	O
of	O
August	O
1781	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
bills	O
which	O
is	O
now	O
produced	O
is	O
ascertained	O
to	O
be	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
received	O
by	O
Archibald	B-pers
Campbell	I-pers
,	O
by	O
two	O
circumstances	O
;	O
first	O
the	O
figures	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
their	O
being	O
all	O
sewed	O
together	O
by	O
the	O
witness	O
Homer	O
.	O
These	O
facts	O
if	O
true	O
,	O
distinguish	O
that	O
bill	O
from	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
has	O
not	O
such	O
a	O
mark	O
as	O
this	O
has	O
by	O
the	O
sewing	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
it	O
has	O
the	O
same	O
words	O
upon	O
it	O
,	O
yet	O
the	O
witness	O
says	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
his	O
manner	O
of	O
writing	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
can	O
take	O
upon	O
himself	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
his	O
manner	O
of	O
writing	O
:	O
this	O
true	O
bill	O
is	O
proved	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
and	O
had	O
until	O
after	O
that	O
16th	O
of	O
May	O
,	O
1782	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
evidence	O
that	O
more	O
than	O
one	O
bill	O
existed	O
:	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
forged	O
bill	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
account	O
of	O
it	O
whatever	O
,	O
nor	O
is	O
it	O
ever	O
seen	O
till	O
the	O
4th	O
of	O
November	O
,	O
1782	O
,	O
on	O
that	O
day	O
the	O
prisoner	O
left	O
such	O
a	O
bill	O
with	O
Ransom	O
and	O
Co.	O
therefore	O
you	O
see	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
has	O
negotiated	O
two	O
bills	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
tenor	O
and	O
date	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
asking	O
what	O
account	O
is	O
given	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
how	O
he	O
got	O
the	O
two	O
bills	O
,	O
because	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
proved	O
to	O
have	O
had	O
both	O
,	O
but	O
how	O
he	O
became	O
possessed	O
of	O
both	O
the	O
bills	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
evidence	O
at	O
all	O
:	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
proved	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
negotiated	O
both	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
is	O
false	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
strong	O
degree	O
of	O
proof	O
that	O
he	O
knew	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
made	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
proved	O
that	O
he	O

the	O
the	O

bill	O
,	O
and	O
knew	O
how	O

it	O
was	O
made	O
.	O
The	O
only	O
remaining	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
bill	O
now	O
produced	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
given	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
to	O
Ransom	O

the	O
28th	O
of	O

1783	O

and	O
another	O
bill	O
was	O
delivered	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
;	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Morland	O
and	O
his	O
clerk	O
both	O
swear	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
bill	O
of	O
210	O
l.	O
payable	O
the	O
28th	O
of	O
April	O
,	O
1783	O
,	O

this	O
bill	O
which	O
they	O
received	O
from	O
the	O
prisoner	O

they	O
put	O

and	O
for	O
the	O

any	O
of	O

that	O
