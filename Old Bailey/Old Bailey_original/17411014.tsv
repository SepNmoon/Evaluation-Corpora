Buquois	O
took	O
out	O
of	O

and	O
this	O
disputable	O
six	O

where	O
I	O
usually	O

my	O

When	O
they	O
first	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
make	O
some	O
resistance	O
with	O
my	O
cane	O
:	O
They	O
had	O
each	O
of	O
them	O

they	O
asked	O
me	O
how	O
I	O
could	O

when	O
I	O
saw	O

me	O
have	O
my	O
key	O
again	O

which	O
they	O
had	O
taken	O

Upon	O

twirled	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
fell	O
in	O
the	O
grass	O

I	O
then	O
desired	O
the	O
prisoners	O
to	O
come	O
back	O

look	O
for	O
it	O
;	O
they	O
did	O
so	O

pursued	O
them	O
,	O

met	O
a	O

told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
robb	O

but	O
he	O
like	O
a	O
coward	O
would	O
not	O
assist	O
me	O

Upon	O
this	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
'till	O
my	O
spirits	O
were	O
much	O

I	O
met	O

desired	O
him	O
to	O
assist	O
me	O

die	O

when	O
I	O
had	O
run	O
with	O
him	O
about	O
two	O

thought	O

have	O
burst	O

was	O

I	O
knew	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
persons	O
that	O
robbed	O
me	O

I	O
desired	O
Buquois	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
see	O
what	O
money	O
he	O
had	O
in	O
his	O
pocket	O

he	O
pulled	O
out	O
two	O

this	O
very	O
sixpence	O

It	O
is	O
a	O

it	O
a	O
great	O
while	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
