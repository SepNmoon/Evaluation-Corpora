that	O

the	O

they	O
observed	O

that	O
the	O

considered	O
as	O
a	O
continuation	O

it	O
is	O
fair	O

that	O

these	O
grounds	O
it	O
is	O
I	O
submit	O
first	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
offence	O

not	O

not	O
of	O

more	O

the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O

than	O
any	O

:	O
the	O

upon	O
the	O
facts	O

for	O

this	O

that	O

that	O

,	O
I	O

go	O
rather	O
to	O
the	O
form	O
of	O
the	O
indictment	O
than	O
the	O
circumstances	O
which	O
appear	O
in	O

one	O
question	O
that	O
has	O

is	O

that	O
this	O

,	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
objection	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
clear	O

from	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
Mr.	O

that	O
the	O

personally	O
to	O
Mr.	O

,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
it	O
under	O

personal	O
care	O
and	O
custody	O
;	O
and	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
under	O
the	O

not	O
,	O
may	O
be	O

be	O
under	O

Then	O
the	O
great	O
objection	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
stated	O
whether	O
this	O
robbery	O
was	O
in	O

,	O
is	O
an	O
objection	O
upon	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

itself	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
is	O

here	O
you	O
have	O
only	O
to	O
apply	O
the	O

upon	O
