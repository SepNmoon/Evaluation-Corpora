as	O
an	O

this	O
sort	O

I	O
undertake	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O

a	O
sort	O
of	O
fact	O
that	O
carries	O
with	O
it	O
some	O
evidence	O
against	O
the	O
prisoner	O

we	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
melancholy	O
instance	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
defence	O
of	O
insanity	O
has	O
been	O
proposed	O
as	O
an	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
commission	O
of	O
the	O
greatest	O
offence	O
,	O
that	O
of	O
murder	O
;	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
asked	O
of	O
the	O
witnesses	O

whether	O
they	O
had	O
observed	O
any	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
party	O

that	O
induced	O
them	O
to	O
form	O
an	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
that	O
party	O
was	O
disordered	O

you	O
can	O
not	O

that	O
question	O

to	O
any	O
one	O
single	O
fact	O
,	O
whether	O
at	O
that	O
instant	O
his	O
mind	O
was	O
under	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
insanity	O
;	O
but	O
you	O
are	O
to	O
lay	O
before	O
the	O
Jury	O
,	O
a	O
sufficient	O
quantity	O
of	O
acts	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
inference	O
for	O
the	O
Jury	O
to	O
presume	O
that	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
not	O
accountable	O
;	O
we	O
therefore	O
always	O
ask	O
what	O
has	O
the	O
party	O
done	O
and	O
said	O
;	O
and	O
conducted	O
himself	O
;	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
your	O
observation	O
on	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
originally	O
?	O

it	O
is	O
upon	O
that	O
idea	O
I	O
state	O
to	O
your	O
Lordship	O
the	O
principle	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
produce	O
this	O
as	O
evidence	O
;	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
evidence	O
for	O
him	O

because	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
framed	O
and	O
fabricated	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
defence	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
insanity	O
differs	O
from	O
all	O
other	O
cases	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
law	O
presumes	O
that	O
these	O
are	O
not	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
does	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
as	O
much	O
a	O
mere	O
machine	O
in	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
something	O
that	O
governs	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
the	O

in	O
that	O

all	O

at	O

am	O
of	O
opinion	O

that	O
the	O

your	O

is	O
extremely	O
different	O
;	O
the	O
misfortune	O
of	O
the	O
younger	O

seems	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
that	O
of	O
having	O
a	O
very	O
abandoned	O
and	O
wicked	O
father	O

instead	O

and	O
training	O
him	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
paths	O
of	O
honesty	O
and	O
virtue	O
,	O
has	O
been	O
unquestionably	O
the	O
means	O
of	O
bringing	O
his	O
son	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
himself	O
into	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
stand	O

in	O
such	O
a	O
situation	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
son	O
deserves	O
compassion	O
,	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
father	O
deserves	O
none	O
;	O
and	O
if	O
the	O
law	O
had	O
made	O
it	O
a	O
capital	O
crime	O
,	O
few	O
would	O
have	O
deserved	O
that	O
sentence	O
more	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
law	O
has	O
not	O
made	O
it	O
a	O
capital	O
offence	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
punishment	O
of	O
the	O
father	O
,	O
wicked	O
as	O
he	O
is	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
short	O
of	O
death	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
we	O
consider	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
instigator	O
of	O
his	O
son	O
to	O
commit	O
this	O
crime	O
,	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
partaker	O
,	O
and	O
has	O
afterwards	O
sought	O
to	O
cover	O
that	O
crime	O
,	O
by	O
bringing	O
a	O
perjured	O
witness	O
into	O
Court	O
;	O
it	O
appears	O
that	O
no	O
punishment	O
short	O
of	O
death	O
can	O
be	O
too	O
great	O
for	O
that	O
offence	O
;	O
the	O
offence	O
of	O
the	O
son	O
,	O
would	O
under	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
father	O
alone	O
,	O
call	O
for	O
a	O
milder	O
degree	O
of	O
punishment	O
than	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
will	O
now	O
admit	O
of	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
committed	O
with	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
a	O
breach	O
of	O
trust	O
,	O
rising	O

robbing	O

took	O
out	O
a	O
half	O

I	O
only	O

a	O

the	O
shilling	O
he	O

taken	O
out	O

I	O
conceived	O
one	O

might	O
be	O

another	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
decisive	O
in	O
my	O

not	O
withstanding	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
