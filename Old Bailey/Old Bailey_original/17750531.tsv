the	O

to	O

him	O
have	O
the	O
loan	O

fourteen	O

that	O
he	O

as	O
he	O
had	O
lately	O
made	O
a	O

,	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
twelve	O

fourteen	O
thousand	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
title	O

of	O
such	O
an	O
estate	O
were	O
a	O
good	O

leave	O
them	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
have	O
the	O
money	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Perreau	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
purchase-money	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
paid	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
.	O
Then	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
a	O
bond	O
of	O
a	O
gentleman	O
whose	O
name	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
liberty	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
to	O
mention	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
I	O
knew	O
the	O
person	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
sure	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
objection	O
to	O
it	O
.	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
every	O
thing	O
depends	O
upon	O
the	O
name	O
,	O
for	O
some	O
mens	O
bonds	O
are	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
other	O
mens	O
mortgages	O
.	O
Then	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
house	O
in	O
Harley	O
Street	O
,	O
Cavendish	O
Square	O
,	O
which	O
cost	O
four	O
thousand	O

:	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
leave	O
with	O
me	O
the	O
deeds	O
of	O
that	O
house	O
and	O
the	O
insurance	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
security	O
for	O
this	O
fourteen	O

accordingly	O
he	O
came	O
the	O
next	O

did	O
leave	O
the	O
deeds	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
as	O
a	O
security	O
;	O

the	O

to	O
do	O
every	O

that	O
was	O
necessary	O
:	O
but	O
as	O
he	O
only	O
wanted	O
it	O
for	O
ten	O
days	O
,	O
I	O
only	O
took	O
a	O
note	O
for	O
it	O
,	O
without	O
any	O
further	O
promise	O
:	O
this	O
was	O
about	O
the	O
15th	O
or	O
16th	O
of	O
January	O
.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
him	O
again	O
till	O
Tuesday	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
March	O
.	O
I	O
was	O
acquainted	O
with	O
him	O
before	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
apothecary	O

having	O
known	O

him	O

When	O
he	O
came	O
upon	O
the	O
7th	O
of	O
March	O
,	O
he	O
made	O
an	O
apology	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
kept	O
his	O
word	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
fourteen	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
borrowed	O
but	O
for	O
about	O
ten	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
came	O
then	O
to	O
borrow	O
five	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
,	O
out	O
of	O
which	O
he	O
was	O
to	O
pay	O
this	O
fourteen	O
hundred	O

.	O
He	O
then	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
got	O
leave	O
of	O
the	O
gentleman	O
,	O
whose	O
bond	O
he	O
formerly	O
mentioned	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
his	O
name	O

I	O
asked	O
my	O
brother	O
Robert	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
to	O
consult	O
about	O
the	O
propriety	O
of	O
lending	O
such	O
a	O
sum	O
as	O
that	O
;	O
the	O
prisoner	O
then	O
produced	O
this	O
bond	O
;	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
saw	O
it	O
,	O
we	O
both	O
expressed	O
a	O
disbelief	O
of	O
its	O
being	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
's	O
bond	O
;	O
and	O
asked	O
the	O
prisoner	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
Mr.	O
William	B-pers
Adair	I-pers
's	O
,	O
the	O
late	O
agent	O
,	O
that	O
lived	O
in	O
Pall-Mall	O
?	O
He	O
said	O
,	O
yes	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
could	O
be	O
no	O
doubt	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
that	O
Arthur	O
Jones	O

who	O
was	O
the	O
solicitor	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
,	O
was	O
a	O
witness	O
,	O
and	O
Start	O
was	O
his	O
servant	O
.	O
I	O
still	O
expressed	O
my	O
doubts	O
about	O
the	O
authenticity	O
of	O
the	O
bond	O
:	O
upon	O
which	O
the	O
prisoner	O
said	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
was	O
his	O
particular	O
friend	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
family	O
connexious	O
between	O
them	O
;	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
had	O
money	O
of	O
his	O
in	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
allowed	O
him	O
interest	O
for	O
it	O
.	O
I	O
understood	O
likewise	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
certain	O
of	O
that	O
particular	O
fact	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
bond	O
was	O
given	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
to	O
him	O
as	O
the	O
balance	O
of	O
the	O
account	O
subsisting	O
between	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
and	O
him	O
.	O
Notwithstanding	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
believe	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
hand-writing	O
of	O
Mr.	O
William	B-pers
Adair	I-pers
,	O
because	O
we	O
had	O
had	O
dealings	O
with	O
him	O
a	O
good	O
while	O
age	O
,	O
and	O
seen	O
his	O
draughts	O
;	O
and	O
we	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
call	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
.	O
He	O
accordingly	O
took	O
the	O
bond	O
with	O
him	O
and	O
went	O
away	O
:	O
but	O
in	O
about	O
two	O
hours	O
,	O
he	O
returned	O
;	O
my	O
brother	O
was	O
then	O
gone	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
saw	O
him	O
alone	O
.	O
He	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
what	O
my	O
brother	O
and	O
I	O
had	O
thrown	O
out	O
respecting	O
the	O
signature	O
to	O
the	O
bond	O
,	O
had	O
alarmed	O
him	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
easy	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
mind	O
till	O
he	O
had	O
called	O
upon	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
luckily	O
met	O
before	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
take	O
his	O
ride	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
produced	O
the	O
bond	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
;	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
said	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
his	O
signature	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
possibly	O
have	O
altered	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
time	O
we	O
had	O
formerly	O
seen	O
him	O
write	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
we	O
might	O
let	O
him	O
have	O
the	O
five	O
thousand	O
pounds	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Adair	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
pay	O
the	O
bond	O
in	O
May	O
;	O
though	O
in	O
fact	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
payable	O
till	O
July	O
.	O
Notwithstanding	O
all	O
this	O
,	O
I	O
still	O
had	O
my	O
doubts	O
;	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
express	O
them	O
so	O
strong	O
,	O
but	O
told	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
leave	O
the	O
bond	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
assignment	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
desirous	O
to	O
get	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
bond	O
,	O
in	O

to	O
find	O
out	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
really	O
a	O

you	O

it	O
was	O
surely	O
no	O
time	O

Mr.	O

Mr.	O

asked	O
her	O

I	O
believe	O
,	O
whether	O
she	O
did	O
not	O
give	O
it	O
him	O
?	O
she	O
admitted	O
she	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
in	O

took	O
the	O
whole	O
upon	O

to	O
be	O
the	O
forger	O
of	O
the	O

every	O
thing	O
.	O
I	O
asked	O
him	O
how	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
say	O
he	O
had	O
received	O
a	O

Mr.	O

in	O

from	O
a	O
man	O

did	O
not	O
so	O

I	O
desired	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
letter	O

which	O
he	O
produced	O
;	O
which	O
letter	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
very	O
material	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
the	O
bond	O
,	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
my	O
possession	O
.	O
We	O
could	O
get	O
nothing	O
from	O
him	O

that	O
he	O

an	O

he	O
did	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
impose	O

that	O

it	O
upon	O

for	O
Robert	B-pers

and	O
begged	O
that	O
an	O
innocent	O
man	O
who	O
had	O
a	O

might	O
not	O
suffer	O
;	O
that	O
he	O

a	O
very	O
good	O

was	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
respectable	O

that	O
she	O
was	O
the	O

She	O
desired	O
at	O
first	O
to	O

in	O
a	O

that	O
Mr.	O

nothing	O

cleared	O
up	O

I	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
of	O

up	O
those	O

would	O
be	O
to	O
