Mr.	O

took	O
a	O
counting	O
house	O
of	O

for	O
himself	O
and	O
partner	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Roche	O

;	O

after	O

some	O

,	O
Mr.	O

solicited	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
some	O
of	O

they	O
had	O
a	O

About	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
1806	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hitchen	O
informed	O
me	O
that	O
some	O
differences	O
had	O
arisen	O
between	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
partner	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
made	O
up	O
his	O
mind	O
to	O
discontinue	O
his	O
connection	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
overtures	O
from	O
a	O
gentleman	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Holden	O
,	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
long	O
known	O
in	O
Liverpool	O
,	O
to	O
join	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
corn	O
and	O
provision	O
trade	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
if	O
they	O
could	O
settle	O
their	O
plan	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
shortly	O
dissolve	O
his	O
copartnership	O
with	O
Roche	O
.	O
Soon	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
learnt	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Hitchen	O
and	O
Roche	O
had	O
agreed	O
to	O
dissolve	O
their	O
copartnership	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Hitchen	O
had	O
joined	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Holden	O
and	O
others	O
in	O
a	O
mercantile	O
concern	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
were	O
about	O
to	O
establish	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
requested	O
to	O
take	O
their	O
consignments	O
in	O
addition	O
to	O
my	O
other	O
concerns	O
in	O
the	O

line	O
.	O
I	O
agreed	O
to	O
take	O
them	O
,	O
without	O
thinking	O
it	O
at	O
all	O
necessary	O
to	O
make	O
those	O
enquiries	O
as	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Holden	O
or	O
Saunders	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
done	O
had	O
it	O
been	O
to	O
trust	O
them	O
.	O
I	O
received	O
several	O
large	O
lots	O
of	O
cheese	O
into	O
my	O
warehouse	O
in	O
October	O
last	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
sold	O
on	O
their	O
account	O
.	O
I	O
afterwards	O
received	O
heavy	O
consignments	O
of	O
cargoes	O
of	O
oats	O
and	O
other	O
goods	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
transfer	O
some	O
to	O
cornfactors	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
generally	O
left	O
a	O
profit	O
.	O
They	O
afterwards	O
consigned	O
direct	O
to	O
houses	O
on	O
the	O
corn	O
exchange	O
.	O
After	O
they	O
got	O
established	O
at	O
Ipswich	O
,	O
I	O
received	O
an	O
intimation	O
from	O
Mr.	O
Hitchen	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
it	O
in	O
contemplation	O
to	O
issue	O
their	O
own	O
notes	O
payable	O
on	O
demand	O
in	O
London	O
,	O
similar	O
to	O
country	O
banks	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
would	O
materially	O
tend	O
to	O
the	O
advantage	O
of	O
their	O
mercantile	O
concerns	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
stated	O
that	O
they	O
found	O
a	O
difficulty	O
in	O
prevailing	O
on	O
the	O
London	O
bankers	O
to	O
pay	O
them	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
issued	O
for	O
so	O
small	O
an	O
amount	O
as	O
one	O
pound	O
;	O
and	O
they	O
requested	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
house	O
for	O
them	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
instance	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
supposed	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
that	O
one	O
of	O
their	O
own	O
partners	O
would	O
superintend	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
afterwards	O
,	O
for	O
various	O
reasons	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
prevailed	O
upon	O
to	O
become	O
the	O
payer	O
,	O
they	O
promising	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
always	O
have	O
sufficient	O
assets	O
to	O
answer	O
any	O
demand	O
that	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
upon	O
me	O
.	O
I	O
disliked	O
becoming	O
the	O
payer	O
,	O
principally	O
from	O
its	O
being	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
usual	O
business	O
,	O
and	O
materially	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
would	O
appear	O
to	O
the	O
world	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
accompting-houses	O
,	O
being	O
obliged	O
to	O
keep	O
my	O
mercantile	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
Borough	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
thought	O
it	O
indispensable	O
that	O
their	O
notes	O
should	O
be	O
paid	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
.	O
This	O
appearance	O
was	O
obviated	O
by	O
my	O
getting	O
my	O
friend	O
Winkley	O
and	O
his	O
brother	O
to	O
allow	O
me	O
to	O
make	O
use	O
