I	O
observed	O
a	O
letter	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O

;	O
I	O
recollected	O
that	O
,	O
besides	O
the	O
money	O
it	O
contained	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
my	O
opinion	O

to	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
pressed	O
him	O
very	O
much	O
to	O
return	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
;	O
I	O
assured	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
no	O
sort	O
of	O
consequence	O
to	O
him	O

that	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
material	O
to	O
the	O
nobleman	O
to	O
whom	O
it	O
was	O
addressed	O
,	O
to	O
have	O
it	O
that	O
night	O
by	O

,	O
desiring	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
doubted	O
what	O
I	O
said	O

he	O
had	O
only	O
to	O
look	O
to	O
the	O
superscription	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
or	O
open	O
it	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
pleased	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
then	O
be	O
convinced	O
;	O
he	O
pulled	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
his	O
bosom	O
,	O
drew	O
back	O
a	O
little	O
from	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
the	O

held	O
it	O
up	O

,	O
after	O
satisfying	O
himself	O

he	O
returned	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
immediately	O
turned	O
round	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
two	O
men	O

with	O
the	O

the	O

those	O

that	O
they	O
were	O

them	O

if	O
they	O

them	O

they	O
would	O
probably	O
suffer	O
severely	O
for	O
it	O

one	O
of	O
them	O
immediately	O
came	O
to	O
the	O

putting	O

to	O
the	O

it	O

The	O

to	O
the	O

the	O

something	O
from	O
which	O
a	O

to	O
the	O

his	O

note	O
in	O
question	O
he	O
necessarily	O
knew	O
that	O
note	O

because	O
he	O

Mr.	O

I	O

to	O
suppose	O
a	O
case	O
;	O
a	O
man	O
is	O
indicted	O
for	O
stealing	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
containing	O
a	O
half-guinea	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
which	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
half-a-guinea	O
,	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
lead	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
that	O
indictment	O
could	O
not	O

sustained	O
;	O
then	O
,	O
suppose	O
a	O
fresh	O
indictment	O
is	O
preferred	O
for	O
stealing	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
dump	O
were	O
to	O
be	O
produced	O

evidence	O
of	O
that	O
letter	O

no	O

be	O
had	O
to	O
the	O
original	O
indictment	O
for	O
stealing	O
the	O
half-guinea	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
contend	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
good	O
evidence	O
of	O
a	O
fact	O
to	O
trace	O
the	O
allegation	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
having	O
been	O
in	O

of	O
the	O
parry	O
who	O
clearly	O
had	O
that	O

in	O

That	O
is	O
a	O
case	O
perfectly	O
analagous	O
to	O
this	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
blank	O
paper	O
with	O
marks	O
upon	O
it	O

sufficient	O
to	O

well	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O

the	O
Stamp-act	O
,	O
but	O
we	O
contend-that	O
the	O
words	O
are	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
this	O
;	O
that	O
a	O
paper	O
requiring	O
a	O

not	O

a	O
good	O

instrument	O
.	O
My	O
Lord	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
perfectly	O
clear	O
,	O
notwithstanding	O
the	O
very	O
large	O

extensive	O
words	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
such	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
paper	O
may	O
be	O
given	O
in	O

for	O
some	O
purposes	O

because	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
produced	O

it	O

in	O
a	O
criminal	O

I	O
apprehend	O
it	O

upon	O

that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
the	O
crime	O

that	O
the	O

should	O

false	O

it	O
