his	O

him	O
bills	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
1200	O

put	O
them	O

send	O
them	O

the	O

his	O
correspondent	O
in	O
London	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
Saturday	O
;	O
the	O
master	O
had	O
great	O
confidence	O
in	O
this	O
servant	O
of	O
his	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
,	O
he	O
desired	O
his	O
master	O

permission	O
to	O
visit	O
a	O
relation	O
four	O
or	O
five	O
miles	O

should	O
be	O
at	O
home	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
;	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
;	O
the	O
master	O
's	O
mind	O
misgave	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
sent	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
man	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
there	O
:	O
he	O
sent	O
pursuers	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
discovered	O
he	O
had	O
changed	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
bills	O
at	O
Salisbury	O
;	O

overtook	O
him	O
at	O
Topsham	O
in	O
Devonshire	O
,	O
going	O
to	O
set	O
sail	O
for	O
France	O
;	O
they	O
seized	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
fortunately	O
recovered	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
bills	O
:	O
this	O
man	O
was	O
tried	O
before	O
me	O
,	O

very	O
eminent	O

was	O
Mr.	O
Dunning	O

was	O
counsel	O
for	O
this	O

:	O
they	O
contended	O

that	O
he	O

those	O

from	O
his	O

,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
a	O

:	O
they	O
resembled	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
case	O

a	O

,	O
which	O
I	O
thought	O
bore	O
no	O
similarity	O
to	O
it	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
found	O
guilty	O
:	O
my	O
idea	O
was	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
removed	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
the	O

thing	O

in	O

was	O
met	O
by	O
two	O

prevailed	O
upon	O
him	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
a	O

persuaded	O
him	O

he	O
consented	O
to	O
;	O
and	O
one	O
of	O

and	O
the	O

received	O
eight	O

of	O
the	O

:	O
the	O
question	O
was	O

whether	O
this	O
amounted	O

a	O

;	O
then	O
follows	O
a	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

it	O
seems	O

me	O

that	O

the	O

persons	O

in	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
boy	O
that	O
was	O
sent	O
by	O
his	O
master	O
,	O
to	O
deliver	O
those	O
goods	O

alone	O

that	O
is	O
comprehended	O
in	O
the	O
guilt	O

Now	O
,	O
I	O
conclude	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
goods	O
were	O
stolen	O
from	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
;	O
this	O
man	O

obtaining	O
them	O
by	O
this	O
fraud	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
stated	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
boy	O
,	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
obtained	O
them	O
from	O
the	O
master	O
himself	O
.	O
I	O
hold	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
gentleman	O
's	O
shop	O
,	O
and	O
taken	O
these	O
goods	O
from	O
his	O
counter	O
,	O
or	O
from	O
his	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
immediately	O
ran	O
away	O
with	O
them	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
as	O
much	O
a	O
taking	O
from	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
master	O
,	O
in	O
my	O

a	O

seven	O

he	O
would	O
give	O
three	O

immediately	O
run	O

the	O

that	O
these	O
