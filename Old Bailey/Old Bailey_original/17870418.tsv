on	O

that	O

Mr.	O

I	O
opened	O
the	O

can	O
any	O

so	O

that	O
when	O

himself	O

the	O
most	O

of	O

my	O

out	O
with	O
saying	O

that	O
he	O

surprised	O
at	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
heard	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
this	O
trial	O

and	O
that	O
he	O
imagined	O
you	O
must	O
have	O
felt	O
as	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
to	O
hear	O
such	O
a	O
charge	O

him	O

:	O
But	O
Gentlemen	O

the	O
question	O
will	O
be	O

whether	O
he	O

either	O
by	O
his	O
observation	O
,	O
or	O
by	O

in	O
any	O

this	O

whether	O
they	O

you	O

you	O

that	O

any	O

to	O
the	O

of	O
this	O

ample	O
the	O

;	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
my	O

I	O
trust	O
never	O
will	O
be	O
my	O
practice	O
to	O
prejudice	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
a	O
Jury	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
left	O
the	O
case	O
to	O
its	O
own	O
merits	O
,	O
stating	O
only	O
that	O
these	O

by	O
accusing	O
him	O
of	O

I	O
have	O
now	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
(	O
because	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
found	O
in	O

in	O
the	O
indictment	O
hatched	O
by	O
the	O

And	O
I	O
am	O
further	O
warranted	O
to	O
assert	O

that	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
my	O
learned	O

endeavoured	O
to	O
insinuate	O
imputations	O

on	O
which	O

that	O

My	O

to	O
you	O

that	O
Mr.	O

upon	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

of	O

that	O

to	O
the	O
ground	O

But	O
says	O
my	O
learned	O

,	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O

now	O
it	O

to	O
me	O
that	O
the	O
making	O

is	O
not	O
a	O
very	O

What	O
is	O
Mr.	O

the	O
conduct	O
of	O

very	O

says	O
he	O

give	O
them	O

Mr.	O

the	O

it	O

too	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
perfectly	O
clear	O
;	O
that	O
was	O
proved	O
before	O

married	O
to	O
a	O
man	O
of	O

therefore	O
is	O

out	O

the	O
