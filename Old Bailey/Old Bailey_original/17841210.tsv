of	O

any	O

a	O
power	O
which	O
he	O
exercised	O
without	O
permiting	O
the	O
man	O
to	O
be	O
heard	O
;	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
thought	O
if	O
a	O
Court	O

duly	O

had	O
assumed	O
such	O
a	O
power	O
,	O
it	O
could	O
not	O

for	O

their	O

is	O
greater	O
than	O
other	O
Courts	O
,	O
they	O
never	O
condemn	O
a	O
person	O
unheard	O
therefore	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
justify	O
himself	O
by	O
the	O
martial	O
law	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
has	O
not	O

one	O

him	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
no	O

;	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
prison	O
where	O
he	O

with	O
respect	O
to	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
it	O
deserves	O
a	O
severe	O
condemnation	O
:	O
the	O
other	O
part	O
of	O
his	O

has	O
more	O
probability	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
