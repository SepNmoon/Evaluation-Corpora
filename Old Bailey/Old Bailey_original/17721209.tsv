The	O
people	O
now	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
uncivil	O
;	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
crowd	O
about	O
the	O
entrance	O
into	O
the	O
hall	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
those	O
gentlemen	O

out	O
at	O
one	O
door	O
,	O
the	O
mob	O
laid	O

one	O
lady	O
have	O
the	O

part	O
of	O
her	O
sack	O
cut	O
off	O
;	O
I	O
saw	O
several	O
gentlemen	O
held	O
by	O
their	O
legs	O

by	O
the	O
mob	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
not	O

till	O
they	O
gave	O
them	O

this	O
was	O
at	O
broad	O
daylight	O

As	O
the	O
company	O
came	O
,	O
their	O
violence	O
increased	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
retreat	O
to	O
the	O
iron	O
gate	O
at	O
the	O
hall	O
;	O
when	O
we	O
had	O

were	O
so	O
extreamly	O
outrageous	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
company	O
came	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
willing	O
to	O
go	O
back	O

if	O

some	O
had	O
their	O

one	O
gentleman	O
I	O
saw	O
had	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
head	O
of	O

cut	O
off	O
;	O
a	O
gentleman	O
of	O
my	O

gave	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
chair	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
broke	O
;	O
I	O
held	O
in	O

When	O
it	O
began	O
to	O
grow	O
dusk	O
,	O
the	O
riot	O
was	O
too	O
great	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
stand	O
;	O
we	O
were	O
obliged	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
my	O
Lord	O
Mayor	O
,	O
to	O
inform	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
unless	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
power	O
,	O
more	O
terrible	O
to	O
the	O
mob	O
than	O
constables	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
apprehensive	O
they	O
would	O
break	O
into	O
the	O
hall	O
;	O
my	O
Lord	O
Mayor	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
the	O
civil	O
power	O
then	O

could	O
not	O
surpress	O
the	O

should	O

the	O

;	O
he	O
did	O
so	O
;	O
before	O
they	O
came	O
we	O
had	O
shut	O
the	O
doors	O
;	O
they	O
had	O
then	O
forced	O
themselves	O
through	O
the	O
iron	O
gates	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
inner	O
door	O
of	O
the	O

we	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
go	O
out	O

I	O
was	O
one	O
that	O
went	O
with	O

;	O
and	O
indeed	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
went	O
out	O
they	O
ran	O
away	O
;	O
but	O
what	O
they	O
run	O
for	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
increase	O
their	O
strength	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
were	O
forced	O
to	O
run	O
afterwards	O
,	O
otherwise	O
our	O
lives	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
in	O

pulled	O
down	O

Sir	O

rested	O
upon	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

flung	O
in	O

with	O
such	O
violence	O
that	O
it	O
struck	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
my	O

turned	O
it	O
quite	O
round	O

had	O
afterwards	O
a	O
