in	O

search	O
the	O

I	O

made	O
the	O
search	O
,	O
together	O
with	O
John	B-pers
Barton	I-pers
;	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
there	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
about	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
o'clock	O
at	O
noon	O
,	O
I	O
looked	O
in	O
at	O
the	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
cellar	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
observed	O
a	O
bench	O
,	O
some	O
sand	O
and	O
some	O
water	O
,	O
which	O
looked	O
suspicious	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
appeared	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
used	O
for	O
scowering	O
or	O
cleaning	O
copper	O
;	O
this	O
satisfied	O
me	O
my	O
information	O
was	O
right	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
broke	O
open	O
the	O
door	O
;	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
fore	O
parlour	O
;	O
there	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
book	O
with	O
receipts	O
;	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
parlour	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
cutting	O
engine	O
,	O
for	O
cutting	O
blanks	O
out	O
of	O
copper	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
coin	O
halfpence	O
;	O
sheets	O
or	O
strips	O
of	O
copper	O
are	O
laid	O
in	O
the	O
engine	O
,	O
then	O
with	O
one	O
blow	O
the	O
engine	O
will	O
strike	O
through	O
the	O
sheet	O
or	O
bit	O
of	O
copper	O
,	O
and	O
cut	O
out	O
a	O
round	O
piece	O
like	O
a	O
halfpenny	O
;	O
it	O
had	O
not	O
any	O
cutting	O
materials	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
fitted	O
to	O
receive	O
such	O
cutting	O
materials	O
.	O
From	O
the	O
back	O
parlour	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
cellar	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
found	O
the	O
stamping	O
engine	O
with	O
two	O
dyes	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
these	O
dyes	O
had	O
the	O
impression	O
of	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
a	O
halfpenny	O
;	O
the	O
upper	O
dye	O
one	O
impression	O
,	O
the	O
under	O
dye	O
another	O
impression	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
engine	O
a	O
halfpenny	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
dyes	O
;	O
that	O
halfpenny	O
has	O
been	O
mislaid	O
.	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
half-penny	O
(	O
producing	O
it	O
)	O
lying	O
in	O
a	O
grove	O
of	O
this	O
engine	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
is	O
exactly	O
the	O
same	O
piece	O
of	O
coin	O
;	O
I	O
presume	O
that	O
halfpenny	O
was	O
left	O
between	O
the	O
dyes	O
left	O
the	O
two	O
dyes	O
should	O
rub	O
and	O
hurt	O
one	O
another	O
;	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
the	O
dyes	O
themselves	O
were	O
not	O
cold	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
very	O
lately	O
used	O
.	O
There	O
were	O
lying	O
there	O
besides	O
,	O
some	O
of	O
these	O
round	O
blanks	O
of	O
copper	O
,	O
and	O
likewise	O
cecel	O
,	O
which	O
are	O
remains	O
of	O
these	O
strips	O
of	O
copper	O
after	O
the	O
round	O
dyes	O
have	O
been	O
punched	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
likewise	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
a	O
fire	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
stove	O
grate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
engine	O
appeared	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
lately	O
oiled	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
going	O
easier	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
likewise	O
in	O
a	O
sack	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
room	O
at	O
least	O
a	O
peck	O
of	O
blanks	O
hanging	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
sack	O
like	O
a	O
hammock	O
;	O
they	O
polish	O
them	O
by	O
that-means	O
,	O
putting	O
sand	O
and	O
emery	O
among	O
these	O
blanks	O
into	O
the	O
sack	O
,	O
and	O
shaking	O
them	O
very	O
well	O
together	O
;	O
they	O
will	O
rub	O
against	O
one	O

and	O
by	O
that	O
means	O
they	O
gain	O
a	O
considerable	O
degree	O
of	O

Then	O
I	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
garret	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
I	O
saw	O
another	O
cutting	O
engine	O
;	O
the	O
cutting	O
instruments	O
were	O
still	O
in	O
that	O
engine	O
;	O
it	O
appeared	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
somebody	O
had	O
been	O
lately	O
at	O
work	O
at	O
that	O
engine	O
in	O
the	O

because	O
there	O
was	O

there	O
were	O

a	O
number	O
more	O

that	O
were	O
worn	O
out	O
with	O
use	O
.	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
garret	O
a	O
large	O
pair	O
of	O
shears	O
,	O
which	O
were	O
very	O
proper	O
to	O

into	O
such	O

as	O
they	O
use	O
when	O
they	O

out	O

The	O
