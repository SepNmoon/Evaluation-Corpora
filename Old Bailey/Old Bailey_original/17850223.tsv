I	O

I	O

I	O
think	O
one	O
of	O
the	O

put	O
his	O

down	O

stopped	O
me	O

perhaps	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
one	O
of	O

they	O
stood	O
very	O

I	O

he	O

whether	O
he	O

Mr.	O

.	O
My	O
notion	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
concerning	O
an	O
accomplice	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
is	O
not	O
indicted	O
,	O
although	O
a	O
partaker	O
in	O
the	O
guilt	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
competent	O
witness	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
fit	O
for	O
the	O
Jury	O
to	O
convict	O
upon	O
such	O
testimony	O
,	O
therefore	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
the	O
strictness	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
is	O
to	O
bring	O
proof	O
of	O
the	O
felony	O
being	O
committed	O
;	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
as	O
he	O
is	O
a	O
competent	O
witness	O
,	O
you	O
may	O
set	O
out	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
then	O
what	O
will	O
a	O
Judge	O
say	O
to	O
the	O
Jury	O
?	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
my	O
constant	O
course	O
of	O
practice	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
know	O
many	O
other	O
Judges	O
that	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
,	O
not	O
to	O
call	O
the	O
accomplice	O
first	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
vain	O
thing	O
:	O
and	O
therefore	O
,	O
before	O
you	O

the	O
accomplice	O
,	O
you	O
are	O

a	O
