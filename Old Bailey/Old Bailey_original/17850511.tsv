if	O
I	O
did	O

believe	O
the	O

guilty	O

I	O
would	O
scorn	O

it	O
was	O

him	O

my	O
duty	O

to	O

him	O

as	O
if	O

The	O
offence	O
I	O
have	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
from	O
the	O
act	O
of	O

,	O
whether	O
the	O

falls	O
within	O

opinion	O

Guilty	O

The	O
prisoner	O
is	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
originally	O
a	O
native	O
of	O
Hampshire	O
,	O
at	O

he	O
has	O
lived	O
in	O

for	O
some	O
years	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
until	O
this	O
offence	O
was	O
committed	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
was	O
continually	O
there	O

On	O
the	O
9th	O
of	O
January	O

1783	O

in	O
a	O
house	O
at	O
Burley	O
in	O
Southampton	O

where	O
they	O
went	O

seized	O
fifty	O
bags	O
of	O
tea	O

and	O
forty	O
casks	O
of	O
Geneva	O
;	O
soon	O
after	O
a	O

belonging	O
to	O

coming	O

they	O
desired	O
he	O
would	O
permit	O
them	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
Ringwood	O
;	O
time	O
enough	O
had	O
elapsed	O
between	O
the	O
seizure	O
and	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
conveying	O
it	O

for	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
number	O

whom	O
the	O

is	O
one	O

between	O
thirty	O

some	O

this	O
seizure	O
was	O
to	O

to	O

Excise-Office	O
;	O
it	O
will	O
appear	O
in	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
trial	O

that	O

the	O

that	O

no	O
ammunition	O

and	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O

enough	O
