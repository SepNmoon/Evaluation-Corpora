unnatural	O

a	O

the	O

will	O
naturally	O

him	O
that	O

they	O

thing	O

to	O

the	O

did	O
he	O

did	O
he	O
not	O
perceive	O

Coleman	O

if	O
you	O

he	O

it	O
takes	O
off	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
from	O
the	O
weight	O
of	O
the	O
evidence	O
;	O
but	O
Coleman	O
tells	O
you	O
he	O
is	O
positive	O
so	O
early	O
as	O
when	O
they	O
got	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
Admiralty	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
must	O
perceive	O
he	O
was	O
pursued	O
by	O
him	O
:	O
how	O
comes	O
it	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
as	O
nothing	O
is	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
go	O
from	O
place	O
to	O
place	O
,	O
till	O
he	O
goes	O
to	O
one	O
place	O

where	O
he	O
staid	O
about	O
five	O

Coleman	O
had	O
endeavoured	O
to	O
affront	O
him	O
in	O
every	O
way	O
;	O
and	O
notwithstanding	O
that	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
takes	O
no	O
notice	O
of	O
it	O
.	O
The	O
next	O
thing	O
that	O
arises	O
,	O
is	O
what	O
passed	O
when	O
they	O
went	O
down	O
St.	O

tells	O
you	O

I	O
do	O
not	O

had	O
lived	O
in	O
London	O

might	O

nothing	O

However	O

the	O

what	O

of	O
Coleman	O

a	O

fainted	O
away	O

one	O

that	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
prisoner	O

behaviour	O
at	O
that	O
time	O

why	O
his	O

the	O
