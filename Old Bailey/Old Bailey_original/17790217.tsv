with	O

he	O
asked	O
me	O
what	O
I	O

when	O
I	O

him	O
there	O

I	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
accuse	O
him	O

I	O
have	O

some	O

I	O
turned	O
round	O

seised	O
him	O
by	O
the	O

immediately	O

He	O
complained	O

that	O
I	O

him	O

the	O

that	O

,	O
I	O

I	O
returned	O
for	O

I	O

used	O
him	O
too	O
well	O

for	O
I	O
had	O

him	O
go	O

but	O
should	O
take	O
care	O
to	O
do	O
better	O
this	O
time	O
,	O
still	O
keeping	O
fast	O
hold	O
of	O
his	O

Upon	O
which	O
he	O
desired	O

that	O
I	O
would	O
use	O
him	O
like	O
a	O
GENTLEMAN	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
dragged	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
along	O
quietly	O
.	O
I	O
saw	O
nobody	O
then	O
pass	O
me	O
that	O
was	O
likely	O
to	O
assist	O
me	O
,	O
in	O
case	O
he	O
should	O
have	O
any	O
gang	O

or	O
any	O
body	O
near	O
him	O
to	O
rescue	O
him	O

to	O
get	O
him	O
secured	O
with	O
as	O
much	O
quietness	O
as	O
possible	O

him	O

If	O
he	O
would	O
walk	O
along	O
quietly	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
coffee-house	O

would	O

him	O

I	O
could	O
hardly	O
keep	O
my	O
fingers	O
from	O
his	O
throat	O
.	O
We	O
then	O
walked	O
down	O
Dover-street	O

and	O
about	O
the	O

of	O
it	O
,	O
rather	O
before	O

the	O

I	O
believe	O
,	O
kept	O
by	O
a	O
man	O

name	O
is	O
Ditilly	O
,	O
I	O
met	O
two	O
gentlemen	O
of	O
my	O
acquaintance	O

I	O
then	O
thought	O
I	O
would	O
throw	O
off	O
my	O
civility	O
,	O
and	O
seise	O
the	O
prisoner	O
again	O

that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
pretty	O
well	O
assured	O

I	O
accordingly	O
seised	O
him	O
again	O
by	O
the	O
collar	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
those	O
gentlemen	O
to	O
assist	O
me	O

whether	O
they	O
understood	O
my	O

not	O

I	O
can	O
not	O
say	O

I	O
received	O
no	O
assistance	O
from	O
them	O

When	O
I	O
spoke	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
walked	O
on	O
pretty	O
fast	O
,	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
he	O
could	O
without	O
making	O
a	O
run	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
down	O
Dover-street	O

When	O
I	O
perceived	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
stay	O
to	O
expostulate	O
with	O
my	O
friends	O

I	O
followed	O
him	O
down	O
immediately	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
ever	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
collared	O
him	O
again	O

and	O
called	O
to	O
some	O

I	O
observed	O
there	O
,	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
a	O

The	O
prisoner	O
struggled	O
a	O
good	O

He	O
would	O
not	O

and	O
bidding	O
me	O
hold	O
off	O

him	O

would	O
not	O
let	O
him	O
go	O

and	O
in	O
the	O
struggle	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
he	O
fell	O
down	O
twice	O
.	O
I	O
let	O
him	O
go	O
as	O
he	O
fell	O

the	O

was	O

much	O
rested	O
upon	O

The	O
prisoner	O
in	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
what	O
he	O
has	O
said	O
certainly	O
meant	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
court	O
to	O
consider	O
whether	O
under	O
the	O
circumstances	O
of	O
this	O
case	O
the	O
taking	O
the	O
money	O
is	O
in	O
point	O

What	O
is	O
or	O
what	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
robbery	O
is	O
in	O
general	O
a	O
question	O
of	O
law	O
.	O
Now	O
,	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
general	O
definition	O
of	O
a	O
robbery	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
money	O
must	O
be	O
taken	O
by	O
violence	O
and	O
against	O
the	O
will	O
.	O
With	O
respect	O
to	O
actual	O
putting	O
in	O
fear	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
frequently	O
decided	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
;	O
if	O
such	O
circumstances	O
are	O
used	O
as	O
will	O
put	O
a	O
reasonable	O
man	O
in	O
fear	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
force	O
or	O
violence	O
that	O
is	O
necessary	O
to	O
constitute	O
a	O
robbery	O
.	O
Now	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
suggested	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
's	O
counsel	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
the	O
prisoner	O
did	O
not	O
charge	O
Mr.	O
Charles	B-pers
Fielding	I-pers
with	O
having	O
actually	O
committed	O
a	O
capital	O
offence	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
only	O
having	O
made	O
an	O
attempt	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
making	O
an	O
attempt	O
alone	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
endangered	O
his	O
life	O
.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
,	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
law	O
,	O
that	O
that	O
would	O
at	O
all	O
avail	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
hold	O
it	O
sufficient	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
law	O
(	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
conceive	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
decided	O
by	O
all	O
the	O
judges	O
)	O
that	O
accusing	O
a	O
man	O
with	O
an	O
attempt	O
to	O
commit	O
sodomy	O
,	O
which	O
puts	O
him	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
that	O
he	O
can	O
not	O
act	O
with	O
his	O
own	O
will	O
,	O
is	O
sufficient	O
,	O
and	O
is	O
violence	O
enough	O
to	O
constitute	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
robbery	O
.	O
But	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
leave	O
it	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
First	O
to	O
consider	O
,	O
whether	O
upon	O
this	O
evidence	O
there	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
actual	O
terror	O
in	O
the	O
person	O
accused	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
that	O
be	O
proved	O
to	O
your	O
satisfaction	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
case	O
clearly	O
stands	O
without	O
any	O
doubt	O
whatever	O
.	O
In	O
the	O
next	O
place	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
satisfied	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
yet	O
if	O
the	O
charge	O
is	O
such	O
in	O
its	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
imposes	O
such	O
a	O
restraint	O
on	O
the	O
person	O
accused	O
that	O
he	O
must	O
at	O
all	O
events	O
be	O
said	O
to	O
part	O
with	O
his	O
money	O
unwillingly	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
law	O
is	O
sufficient	O
to	O
constitute	O
a	O
robbery	O
.	O
Having	O
now	O
stated	O
the	O
law	O
upon	O
the	O
case	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
state	O
to	O
you	O
what	O
has	O
been	O
proved	O
by	O
the	O
witnesses	O

Mr.	O

the	O

Lord	O

says	O
he	O
saw	O
nobody	O

there	O
likely	O

he	O
told	O
the	O

if	O

walk	O
quietly	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
coffee-house	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
not	O

that	O

walked	O
down	O
Dover-street	O
;	O
that	O
about	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
it	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
met	O
two	O

of	O

that	O
he	O
then	O
thought	O

he	O
seised	O
the	O

called	O

the	O

they	O
did	O
not	O

him	O
,	O
perhaps	O
they	O
might	O
not	O

the	O

then	O
walked	O
on	O
pretty	O
fast	O
,	O
which	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
observing	O
,	O
followed	O

caught	O
him	O
at	O
the	O
corner	O
of	O
the	O
street	O
,	O
and	O
called	O
to	O
some	O
chairmen	O
to	O
send	O
for	O
a	O

;	O
the	O
prisoner	O
struggled	O
a	O
good	O

saying	O
he	O

Lord	O

in	O
the	O

he	O
fell	O

that	O
he	O
seised	O

during	O
this	O
he	O
observed	O

passing	O
along	O
the	O

he	O
called	O
to	O
him	O

what	O
was	O
the	O

two	O

the	O

to	O
Sir	O

he	O
was	O

this	O

the	O
evidence	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prosecution	O
.	O
The	O
prisoner	O
has	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
met	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
twice	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
says	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
met	O
him	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
charge	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
with	O
any	O
crime	O
or	O
any	O
attempt	O
to	O
commit	O
a	O
crime	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
only	O
said	O
to	O
him	O
.	O
He	O
wanted	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
something	O
about	O
his	O
brother	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
made	O
answer	O
,	O
I	O
wo	O
n't	O
hear	O
what	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
already	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Charles	B-pers
Fielding	I-pers
,	O
he	O
further	O
adds	O
,	O
had	O
the	O
words	O
put	O
into	O
his	O
mouth	O
at	O
Sir	O
John	B-pers
Fielding	I-pers
's	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
make	O
no	O
charge	O
himself	O
at	O
first	O
.	O
The	O
defence	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
made	O
it	O
incumbent	O
upon	O
me	O
to	O
ask	O
Lord	O
Fielding	O
and	O
Mr	O
.	O
Fielding	O
,	O
whether	O
any	O
such	O
thing	O
did	O
pass	O
,	O
or	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
truth	O
in	O
what	O
this	O
suggested	O
by	O
the	O
prisoner	O
;	O
they	O
both	O
denied	O
it	O
.	O
This	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
evidence	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
given	O
to	O
you	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
consider	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
two	O
lights	O
I	O
have	O
mentioned	O
.	O
Whether	O
you	O
are	O
satisfied	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
actual	O
force	O
and	O
violence	O
and	O
a	O
restraint	O
upon	O
the	O
mind	O
of	O
Mr	O
.	O
Fielding	O
,	O
that	O
rests	O
upon	O
his	O
evidence	O
,	O
for	O
nobody	O
could	O
be	O
present	O
but	O
himself	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
the	O
prisoner	O
a	O
half	O
guinea	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
all	O
the	O
money	O
he	O
had	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
not	O
contented	O
with	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
tells	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
sufficient	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
demand	O
of	O
more	O
,	O
if	O
Mr	O
.	O
Fielding	O
had	O
more	O
that	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
given	O
him	O
;	O
and	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
there	O
is	O
something	O
very	O
singular	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
meeting	O
when	O
Mr	O
.	O
Fielding	O
went	O
to	O
Mr	O
.	O
Waters	O
's	O
and	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
accounted	O
for	O
but	O
from	O
fear	O
and	O
terror	O
in	O
his	O
mind	O
:	O
though	O
he	O
sees	O
this	O
prisoner	O
in	O
the	O
street	O
,	O
and	O
though	O
he	O
goes	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
Bond-street	O
,	O
he	O
knows	O
so	O
little	O
what	O
he	O
is	O
about	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
goes	O
into	O
the	O
grocer	O
's	O
shop	O
.	O
He	O
gives	O
a	O
guinea	O
to	O
the	O
grocer	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
prisoner	O
.	O
He	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
borrow	O
it	O
,	O
for	O
he	O
had	O
it	O
in	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
for	O
what	O
purpose	O
unless	O
through	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
being	O
master	O
of	O
himself	O
,	O
could	O
he	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
shop	O
?	O
The	O
circumstance	O
is	O
very	O
strong	O
to	O
show	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
master	O
of	O
his	O
own	O
mind	O
,	O
but	O
acted	O
through	O
violence	O
and	O
compulsion	O
,	O
besides	O
he	O
has	O
swore	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
apprehend	O
,	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
,	O
the	O
charge	O
would	O
cost	O
him	O
his	O
life	O
.	O
If	O
you	O
believe	O
that	O
evidence	O
,	O
then	O
it	O
seems	O
very	O
clear	O
,	O
that	O
Mr	O
.	O
Fielding	O
acted	O
under	O
the	O
immediate	O
fear	O
and	O
terror	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
of	O
a	O
criminal	O
punishment	O
,	O
but	O
his	O
life	O
being	O
in	O
danger	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
satisfied	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
in	O
many	O
cases	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
persons	O
robbed	O
should	O
apprehend	O
themselves	O
in	O
immediate	O
danger	O

a	O
soldier	O
,	O
or	O
a	O

,	O
has	O
been	O
attacked	O

I	O
remember	O
one	O
where	O
the	O
gentleman	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
robbed	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
fear	O
of	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
judges	O
held	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
received	O
as	O
the	O
law	O
ever	O
since	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
such	O
circumstances	O
are	O
made	O
use	O
of	O
as	O
would	O
impose	O
a	O
terror	O

violence	O
upon	O
a	O

mind	O

the	O
individual	O

might	O
be	O
so	O
confident	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
apprehend	O
danger	O

yet	O
it	O

a	O
