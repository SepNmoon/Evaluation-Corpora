I	O
sat	O
down	O
to	O
consider	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
after	O
which	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
justice	O
Fielding	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
the	O
circumstance	O
as	O
it	O
occur	O
'd	O
to	O
me	O
.	O
He	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
extreamly	O
right	O

I	O
asked	O
his	O
advice	O
what	O
I	O
should	O
do	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
is	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
gentleman	O
home	O
with	O
you	O
,	O
and	O
call	O
up	O
your	O
man	O
first	O

him	O
what	O
you	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
coffee-house	O
to	O
consider	O
of	O
it	O

I	O
thought	O
probably	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
arm	O
'd	O
with	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
removing	O
them	O

I	O
concluded	O
not	O

as	O
Mr	O
