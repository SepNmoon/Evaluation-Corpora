that	O

you	O
give	O
that	O
effect	O
to	O

which	O
simply	O
is	O
the	O
inference	O
of	O

from	O
it	O

which	O
is	O

that	O
the	O

this	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
not	O

of	O

;	O
you	O
are	O
therefore	O
to	O
consider	O
whether	O
you	O

that	O
the	O

of	O
opinion	O
he	O

it	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
him	O
guilty	O
of	O
the	O
whole	O
charge	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
not	O
perhaps	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
you	O
should	O
lean	O
without	O
all	O
reason	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
inference	O
against	O
the	O
evidence	O
;	O
but	O
if	O
you	O

any	O
just	O
ground	O
to	O
doubt	O
whether	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
the	O
hand	O
that	O

it	O

or	O
whether	O
the	O
man	O

it	O

it	O
over	O

is	O
the	O
frequent	O
mode	O

you	O

:	O
According	O
to	O
your	O
opinion	O
on	O
that	O

your	O

My	O

as	O
you	O
are	O
called	O
on	O
to-day	O
to	O
adjudge	O
a	O
point	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
of	O
more	O
importance	O
to	O
the	O
whole	O
public	O
than	O
any	O
that	O
has	O
ever	O

before	O
the	O
Court	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
make	O
no	O
apology	O
for	O
troubling	O
your	O
Lordship	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
.	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
so	O
clear	O
,	O
in	O
any	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
this	O
subject	O
is	O
considered	O
,	O
as	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
no	O
means	O
that	O
which	O
they	O
contend	O
;	O
they	O
contend	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
charter	O
of	O
restoration	O
to	O
all	O
legal	O
rights	O
which	O
he	O
had	O
before	O
;	O
I	O
contend	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
charter	O
of	O
remission	O
and	O
pardon	O
;	O
and	O
of	O
remission	O
and	O
pardon	O
only	O
,	O
not	O
a	O
charter	O
of	O
restoration	O
.	O
In	O
considering	O
it	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
,	O
I	O
shall	O
endeavour	O
to	O
prove	O
it	O
,	O
first	O
,	O
by	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
deed	O
itself	O
,	O
seeing	O
what	O
it	O
bears	O
on	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
what	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
the	O
King	O
's	O
intention	O
;	O
the	O
King	O
can	O
not	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
charter	O
which	O
he	O
can	O
grant	O
to	O
the	O
subject	O
,	O
do	O
that	O
which	O
my	O
friends	O
contend	O
he	O
has	O
done	O
by	O
the	O
present	O
pardon	O
,	O
the	O
thing	O
itself	O
states	O
a	O
remission	O
of	O
that	O
which	O
the	O
King	O
had	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
inflict	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
nothing	O
can	O
be	O
so	O
clear	O
that	O
the	O
King	O
has	O
gone	O
to	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
of	O
his	O
authority	O
:	O
You	O
know	O
all	O
offences	O
are	O
construed	O
in	O
the	O
law	O
to	O
be	O
against	O
the	O
State	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
all	O
in	O
breach	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
peace	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
laws	O
which	O
are	O
made	O
are	O
against	O
all	O
offenders	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
sword	O
of	O
justice	O
must	O
be	O
lodged	O
in	O
some	O
hand	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
power	O
of	O
pardoning	O
must	O
be	O
somewhere	O

so	O
in	O
this	O

the	O
punishment	O
of	O

on	O

and	O
on	O
the	O
prerogative	O
of	O

:	O
It	O
is	O
certainly	O
true	O
that	O
the	O
prerogative	O
of	O
the	O

in	O

extends	O
only	O
to	O
the	O

of	O
all	O
which	O
the	O

is	O
the	O
guardian	O

and	O
therefore	O
I	O
hold	O
that	O
the	O
Crown	O
can	O
not	O
release	O
the	O
vested	O
right	O
of	O
any	O
private	O

a	O

any	O
act	O
which	O
the	O
Crown	O
chuses	O
to	O

the	O

may	O
remit	O
that	O
penalty	O
as	O

as	O
relates	O
to	O
itself	O

the	O

it	O
can	O
not	O
remit	O
that	O
interest	O
which	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
individual	O
;	O
the	O
same	O
principle	O
is	O
applied	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
appeals	O

which	O
are	O
prosecutions	O
allowed	O
by	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
carrying	O
that	O
principle	O
too	O
far	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
