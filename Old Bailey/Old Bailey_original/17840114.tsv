it	O

My	O

upon	O
these	O
facts	O
I	O
beg	O
leave	O
to	O
follow	O
my	O
learned	O
friend	O
in	O
this	O
idea	O
as	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
law	O
growing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
;	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
a	O
larceny	O
,	O
I	O
understand	O
from	O
Lord	O
Coke	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
taking	O
must	O
be	O
from	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
property	O
when	O
removed	O
from	O
the	O
possession	O
;	O
if	O
possession	O
be	O
obtained	O
by	O
the	O
person	O
without	O
the	O
ingredients	O
of	O
felony	O
,	O
it	O
then	O
becomes	O
such	O
a	O
subject	O
as	O
can	O
not	O
support	O
the	O
allegation	O
of	O
larceny	O
;	O
here	O
there	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
conception	O
,	O
a	O
clear	O
possession	O
,	O
and	O
such	O
a	O
possession	O
as	O
removes	O
the	O
property	O
clearly	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
Edwards	O
,	O
if	O
so	O
then	O
upon	O
that	O
subject	O
,	O
clearly	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
built	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
larceny	O
.	O
Court	O
.	O
I	O
conceive	O
there	O
is	O
some	O
difference	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
change	O
of	O
property	O
,	O
if	O
this	O
man	O
had	O
kept	O
the	O
note	O
,	O
would	O
it	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
felony	O
in	O
him	O
to	O
have	O
kept	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
note	O
,	O
certainly	O
not	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
alters	O
this	O
thing	O
and	O
he	O
changes	O
it	O
into	O
money	O
;	O
Edwards	O
expects	O
the	O
money	O
;	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
get	O
the	O
money	O
;	O
he	O
never	O
expects	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
note	O
back	O
again	O
;	O
the	O
matter	O
strikes	O
me	O
as	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
rendered	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
plain	O
by	O
any	O
thing	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Garrow	O

My	O
Lord	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
leave	O
this	O
case	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
pleasure	O
to	O
the	O
Court	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
all	O
arguments	O
of	O
this	O
sort	O
are	O
addressed	O
to	O
the	O
Jury	O
,	O
and	O
are	O
intended	O
to	O
have	O
their	O
operation	O
there	O
,	O
it	O
therefore	O
becomes	O
my	O
duty	O
to	O
trouble	O
your	O

with	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
words	O
by	O

My	O

I	O

of	O
my	O

Mr	O

,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
definition	O
of	O
larceny	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
ready	O
to	O
admit	O
that	O
there	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
felonious	O
taking	O
from	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
proprietor	O
,	O
and	O
on	O
that	O
ground	O
I	O
am	O
perfectly	O
contented	O
to	O
argue	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
for	O
I	O
am	O
warranted	O
by	O
a	O
long	O
uninterrupted	O
series	O
of	O
decisions	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
hour	O
of	O
the	O
conversion	O
,	O
was	O
the	O
possession	O
not	O
of	O
the	O

of	O
Mr.	O
Edwards	O
.	O
The	O
case	O
which	O
we	O
are	O
now	O
arguing	O
,	O
is	O
precisely	O
like	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
goes	O
to	O
Smithfield	O
Market	O
and	O
cheapens	O
a	O
horse	O
,	O
the	O
owner	O
delivers	O
him	O
the	O
horse	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
trying	O
his	O
paces	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
stranger	O
rides	O
away	O
with	O
the	O
horse	O
;	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
to	O
address	O
myself	O
to	O
the	O
common	O
understanding	O
of	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
hears	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
to	O
ask	O
in	O
whom	O
the	O
possession	O
in	O
the	O
horse	O
resided	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
answer	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
actual	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
owner	O
was	O
determined	O
by	O
his	O
delivery	O
to	O
the	O
stranger	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
law	O
has	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
possession	O
having	O
been	O
acquired	O
with	O
a	O
felonious	O
intent	O
,	O
shall	O
not	O
alter	O
the	O
possession	O
in	O
contemplation	O
of	O
law	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
such	O
a	O
taking	O
is	O
a	O
felony	O

What	O
was	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Sharpless	O
at	O
this	O
place	O
about	O
nine	O
years	O
ago	O
?	O
It	O
was	O
the	O
fashionable	O
trick	O
of	O
that	O
day	O
(	O
for	O
every	O
period	O
has	O
its	O
fashions	O
in	O
artifice	O
)	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
a	O
goldsmith	O
's	O
and	O
to	O
order	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
his	O
goods	O
to	O
be	O
sent	O
home	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
caution	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
for	O
the	O
goldsmith	O
to	O
direct	O
his	O
servant	O
not	O
to	O
leave	O
the	O
goods	O
without	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
but	O
on	O
some	O
pretence	O
Sharpless	O
sent	O
back	O
the	O
servant	O
and	O
kept	O
the	O
goods	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Judges	O
held	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
felony	O
,	O
though	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
goldsmith	O
had	O
any	O
actual	O
possession	O
of	O
his	O
goods	O
after	O
they	O
were	O
delivered	O
by	O
his	O

This	O
case	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
perfectly	O
in	O
point	O

the	O
same	O
principle	O
is	O
,	O
if	O

more	O
strongly	O
recognized	O
in	O
two	O
cases	O

decided	O

the	O

on	O

that	O
