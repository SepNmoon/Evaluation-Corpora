it	O

there	O

so	O
much	O
of	O
it	O

I	O
then	O
directed	O
my	O
discourse	O
to	O
Mrs.	O

I	O
went	O
up	O
into	O
the	O
garret	O

found	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
casements	O
open	O

wondered	O
what	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
I	O
went	O
down	O
again	O
,	O
to	O
assist	O
in	O
putting	O
the	O
things	O
to	O
rights	O
:	O
I	O
found	O
a	O
quantity	O
of	O
chips	O
among	O
the	O
things	O
in	O
the	O
bed	O
:	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
observing	O
the	O
behaviour	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
who	O
seemed	O
to	O
behave	O
more	O
by	O
way	O
of	O
diversion	O
rather	O
than	O
otherwise	O
:	O
I	O
took	O
these	O
chips	O
up	O
;	O
some	O
were	O
burnt	O
to	O
cinders	O
,	O
and	O
some	O
half	O
burnt	O
:	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
suspect	O
something	O
wrong	O
.	O
When	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
up	O
all	O
the	O
pieces	O

cleared	O
away	O
the	O

out	O

the	O

I	O
began	O
to	O
observe	O
the	O
wainscot	O

and	O
found	O
one	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
exceedingly	O
burnt	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
;	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
three	O
parts	O
through	O
;	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
pushed	O
my	O
thumb	O
through	O
it	O
:	O
the	O
door	O
was	O
pretty	O
much	O
burnt	O

Mrs.	O

said	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
bedstead	O
turned	O
up	O
against	O
that	O
part	O
that	O
was	O
much	O
burnt	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
odd	O
which	O
way	O
fire	O
could	O
come	O
between	O
the	O
bedstead	O
and	O
the	O
wainscot	O
;	O
I	O
am	O

there	O

on	O
some	O
bad	O
design	O

The	O

in	O
a	O
very	O
