I	O

you	O
go	O

was	O
coming	O
from	O
Westminster	O

She	O
had	O
no	O

her	O
a	O

she	O
thanked	O
me	O

I	O
believe	O
the	O

asked	O
her	O
at	O

then	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
Hercules	O

I	O
had	O
what	O

I	O
found	O
her	O
what	O
I	O

was	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
her	O
coming	O
out	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
in	O

and	O
he	O
disappointed	O

slighted	O
me	O

I	O
was	O
ready	O
to	O
break	O
my	O

so	O
I	O
came	O
up	O
to	O
London	O
to	O
forget	O
him	O

I	O
said	O
you	O
'll	O
probably	O
have	O
a	O
lover	O
here	O
in	O

I	O
asked	O

she	O
said	O

She	O
went	O

We	O

a	O

about	O
the	O

between	O
six	O

was	O
returned	O
from	O
Greenwich	O

where	O
I	O
had	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
polite	O
enough	O
to	O
give	O
her	O
my	O
hand	O
,	O
I	O
forgot	O
to	O
hand	O
her	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
coach	O

left	O
her	O
there	O
;	O

When	O
my	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
girl	O
that	O
came	O
from	O

perhaps	O
she	O
is	O
some	O

She	O
undressed	O
