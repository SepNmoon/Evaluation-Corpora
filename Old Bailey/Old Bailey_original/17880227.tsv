that	O

my	O
notion	O
of	O

this	O

that	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
an	O
usual	O
instrument	O

it	O
is	O
a	O

a	O
stick	O
that	O
he	O
may	O
carry	O
without	O
exciting	O
any	O
surprize	O
from	O
the	O
size	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
not	O
come	O
within	O
the	O
description	O

any	O
instrument	O
that	O
imports	O
terror	O
in	O
its	O
appearance	O

and	O
that	O
may	O
serve	O
to	O
intimidate	O
persons	O
,	O
that	O
instrument	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O

will	O
be	O
an	O

the	O

of	O
the	O
act	O
,	O

that	O
