is	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O

and	O
to	O
that	O
Mr.	O

if	O
that	O
he	O
so	O
,	O
it	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
done	O
by	O

,	O
then	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
the	O
house	O
was	O
actually	O
broke	O
open	O
;	O
the	O
next	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
person	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
,	O
to	O
that	O

the	O
next	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
;	O
now	O
where	O
the	O
house	O
is	O
broke	O
open	O
in	O
the	O
day	O
time	O
no	O
person	O
being	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
makes	O
a	O
very	O
material	O
difference	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
guilt	O
and	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
punishment	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
the	O

no	O

On	O
the	O
8th	O
of	O
December	O
Wagstaff	O
met	O
the	O
prisoner	O
in	O
Bishopsgate-street	O

asked	O
him	O
if	O

Hayward	O

,	O
no	O
he	O
said	O

he	O

not	O
been	O
there	O
,	O
upon	O
which	O
Wagstaff	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
go	O

They	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
publick-house	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
to	O
Hayward	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
gentleman	O
he	O
had	O
them	O
from	O
was	O
gone	O

Stratford	O

would	O
not	O

he	O

was	O
then	O
under	O
a	O
necessity	O
of	O
going	O
home	O
,	O
but	O
promised	O
to	O
meet	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
:	O
Wagstaff	O
and	O
Hayward	O
were	O
both	O
together	O
at	O
this	O
publick-house	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
both	O
pressed	O
him	O
extremely	O
to	O
name	O
the	O
person	O
from	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
notes	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
declined	O
that	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
perfectly	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O
gentleman	O
from	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
them	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
they	O
were	O
forged	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
begged	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
earnest	O
manner	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
disclose	O
this	O
matter	O
,	O
but	O
keep	O
it	O
secret	O
.	O
Now	O
you	O
will	O
consider	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
go	O
along	O
,	O
whether	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
conduct	O
of	O
an	O
innocent	O
man	O
:	O
the	O
prisoner	O
did	O
not	O
come	O
as	O
he	O

;	O
he	O
promised	O
another	O
day	O
to	O
come	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
:	O
therefore	O
Wagstaff	O
and	O
Hayward	O
both	O
together	O
went	O
again	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
he	O
excused	O
himself	O
with	O
some	O
frivolous	O
excuse	O
for	O
not	O
having	O
kept	O
his	O
promise	O
of	O
coming	O

and	O
then	O
promised	O
again	O
to	O

the	O
next	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
again	O
intreated	O
them	O
not	O

for	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
just	O
got	O
into	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
farm	O
,	O
and	O
begged	O
for	O
God	O
's	O

that	O
it	O
might	O
not	O
be	O
buzzed	O
abroad	O

On	O
the	O
Friday	O
this	O
prisoner	O
met	O
them	O
both	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
Mr.	O
Hayward	O
insisted	O
upon	O
it	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
tell	O
him	O
where	O
and	O
from	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
notes	O
;	O
then	O
his	O
conduct	O
appeared	O
more	O
suspicious	O
,	O
(	O
but	O
however	O
of	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
judge	O
)	O
for	O
being	O
pressed	O
to	O
the	O
wall	O
by	O
Hayward	O

he	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
tell	O
in	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
any	O
witness	O
but	O
if	O
Hayward	O
would	O
retire	O
alone	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
disclose	O
to	O
him	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
the	O
person	O
from	O
whom	O
he	O
had	O
them	O
,	O
then	O
the	O
prisoner	O
and	O
Hayward	O
went	O
into	O
a	O
room	O
by	O
themselves	O

and	O
he	O
extorted	O
from	O
Hayward	O
a	O
solemn	O
promise	O
not	O
to	O

it	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
he	O
asserted	O
that	O
he	O

with	O
the	O
other	O
from	O

he	O
undertook	O
to	O
Hayward	O
that	O

would	O
either	O
bring	O
him	O

the	O

by	O
times	O

the	O

and	O
he	O
again	O
begged	O
of	O
him	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O

if	O
Davis	O
of	O
the	O

that	O

if	O
he	O

some	O

,	O
because	O
it	O
appears	O
by	O
the	O

that	O
when	O
she	O
came	O
back	O

therefore	O
if	O
it	O
was	O

you	O

not	O

here	O
the	O
material	O
question	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
you	O
are	O
satisfied	O
the	O
prisoner	O
did	O
take	O
property	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
forty	O

that	O

the	O

Mr.	O

put	O
it	O
out	O

all	O
doubt	O
;	O
for	O
whatever	O
complaints	O
the	O
girl	O
may	O
from	O
time	O
to	O
time	O
have	O
made	O
of	O
hunger	O
(	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
unlikely	O
that	O
she	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
hungry	O
)	O
,	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
starved	O
to	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
state	O
of	O
her	O
body	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
has	O
told	O
you	O
,	O
seems	O
to	O
exclude	O
all	O
possibility	O
of	O
that	O
:	O
therefore	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
clearing	O
away	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
causes	O
assigned	O
in	O
this	O
indictment	O
for	O
the	O
death	O
:	O
the	O
next	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
her	O
death	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
she	O
lay	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
that	O
also	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
opinion	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Harris	O
;	O
now	O
there	O
are	O
but	O
two	O
ways	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
damp	O
and	O
cold	O
of	O
a	O
place	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
,	O
can	O
occasion	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
a	O
person	O
;	O
the	O
one	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
unwholsomeness	O
of	O
that	O
damp	O
and	O
cold	O
producing	O
some	O
disease	O
in	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
which	O
in	O
its	O
event	O
may	O
be	O
mortal	O
,	O
in	O
which	O
case	O
the	O
damp	O
and	O
unwholsomeness	O
is	O
the	O
primary	O
cause	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
disease	O
produced	O
by	O
it	O
,	O
is	O
the	O
immediate	O
and	O
efficient	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
way	O
is	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
damp	O
and	O
cold	O
operates	O
so	O
much	O
on	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
and	O
produces	O
a	O
chillness	O
and	O
a	O
numbness	O
,	O
attended	O
with	O
a	O
subsequent	O
mortification	O
;	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Harris	O
says	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
produced	O
those	O
appearances	O
which	O
usually	O
attend	O
a	O
violent	O
death	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
,	O
namely	O
the	O
appearances	O
of	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
a	O
mortification	O
visible	O
at	O
the	O
extremities	O
:	O
now	O
although	O
the	O
prisoner	O
's	O
conduct	O
not	O
being	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
,	O
may	O
rather	O
be	O
considered	O
as	O
good	O
fortune	O
,	O
than	O
innocence	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
such	O
appearances	O
on	O
the	O
body	O
;	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
Mr.	O
Harris	O
's	O
opinion	O
,	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
nothing	O
on	O
the	O
body	O
that	O
would	O
warrant	O
him	O
to	O
pronounce	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
damp	O
and	O
cold	O
were	O
the	O
immediate	O
cause	O
of	O
the	O
death	O
;	O
if	O
indeed	O
,	O
the	O
damp	O
and	O
cold	O
were	O
the	O
primary	O
cause	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
on	O
diseases	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
fever	O
,	O
an	O
ague	O
,	O
or	O
other	O
diseases	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
then	O
be	O
a	O
visible	O
disease	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
preceding	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
;	O
now	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
such	O
evidence	O
of	O
any	O
visible	O
disease	O
,	O
except	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
the	O
girl	O
shivering	O
with	O
cold	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
likely	O
fact	O
,	O
if	O
there	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
those	O
extraordinary	O
circumstances	O
of	O
misconduct	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
evidence	O
before	O
us	O
of	O
the	O
actual	O
existence	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
preceding	O
disease	O
:	O
thus	O
it	O
stands	O
on	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Harris	O
;	O
but	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
circumstance	O
which	O
struck	O
me	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
examination	O
of	O
Vaughan	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
induced	O
me	O
to	O
call	O
him	O
again	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
deceased	O
was	O
found	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
found	O
upon	O
her	O
knees	O
,	O
and	O
almost	O
on	O
her	O
face	O
leaning	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
,	O
as	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
fallen	O
forward	O
with	O
her	O
under	O
petticoat	O
on	O
;	O
I	O
therefore	O
called	O
Mr.	O
Vaughan	O
,	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
where	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
her	O
clothes	O
were	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
stated	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
recollect	O
all	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
recollected	O
that	O
her	O
gown	O
was	O
hanging	O
up	O
:	O
now	O
that	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
strong	O
circumstance	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
perished	O
either	O
through	O
the	O
cold	O
,	O
or	O
disease	O
attended	O
by	O
the	O
damp	O
,	O
she	O
would	O
most	O
probably	O
have	O
perished	O
in	O
her	O
bed	O
;	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
cold	O
are	O
to	O
benumb	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
strength	O
and	O
exertion	O
to	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
bed	O
and	O
put	O
on	O
her	O
clothes	O
,	O
that	O
exertion	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
sufficient	O
to	O
have	O
prevented	O
her	O
death	O
from	O
cold	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
she	O
had	O
got	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
bed	O
and	O
was	O
proceeding	O
to	O
dress	O
herself	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
state	O
she	O
had	O
fallen	O
forwards	O
:	O
from	O
the	O
circumstance	O
too	O
of	O
her	O
being	O
not	O
quite	O
dead	O
,	O
coupled	O
with	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
very	O
probable	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
long	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
found	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
then	O
ten	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
therefore	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
the	O
probability	O
appears	O
that	O
this	O
girl	O
had	O
been	O
getting	O
up	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
beginning	O
to	O

;	O
so	O
that	O
