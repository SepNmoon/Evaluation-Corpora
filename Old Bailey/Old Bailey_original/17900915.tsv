they	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
it	O

you	O

that	O
the	O
object	O

your	O
enquiry	O
lays	O
within	O
very	O
small	O
compass	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
always	O
satisfactory	O
that	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
a	O

should	O
be	O
made	O
up	O
from	O
all	O
the	O

I	O

you	O
will	O

up	O
your	O

most	O

without	O
hesitation	O

that	O
the	O

there	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
possible	O
imputation	O
upon	O
any	O
of	O
the	O

which	O
I	O
shall	O

Mr.	O

his	O
testimony	O

at	O
the	O

Mr.	O

has	O
no	O
interest	O
in	O
the	O

;	O
indeed	O

I	O
am	O
anticipating	O
those	O

no	O

and	O
therefore	O
I	O
stop	O

check	O
myself	O
:	O
these	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
when	O
they	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
simple	O
transaction	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
explained	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
will	O
,	O
I	O
trust	O
,	O
leave	O
no	O
doubt	O
in	O
your	O

;	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
receipt	O
given	O

upon	O
which	O
it	O

the	O

:	O
then	O
,	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
case	O
is	O
precluded	O
from	O
every	O
possible	O
observation	O
;	O
those	O
little	O
matters	O
which	O
now	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
indeed	O

arise	O
in	O

cases	O

I	O
think	O
are	O
totally	O
shut	O
out	O
:	O
but	O
,	O
if	O
your	O
minds	O
were	O
not	O
compleatly	O
satisfied	O
on	O
account	O
of	O
the	O
receipt	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
still	O
remain	O
a	O
forgery	O
;	O
and	O
a	O
forgery	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
conceive	O

proved	O

assuming	O
that	O

the	O

for	O
it	O
still	O
is	O
a	O
forgery	O
by	O
the	O

;	O
imposition	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
impossible	O
to	O
conceive	O

in	O
the	O
present	O
case	O
,	O
being	O
made	O
by	O
any	O
person	O
whatever	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
when	O
you	O
come	O
to	O
compare	O
the	O
two	O
transactions	O
together	O

when	O
you	O
take	O
into	O
your	O
consideration	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
that	O
comparison	O
,	O
you	O
must	O
be	O
persuaded	O
that	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

wickedly	O
bent	O
that	O

a	O

that	O

it	O

that	O

it	O

to	O
Lord	O

a	O
bad	O

it	O
is	O
also	O
clear	O
that	O
Hart	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
health	O
,	O
that	O
violent	O
,	O
ill-tempered	O

people	O
might	O
very	O
well	O
hasten	O

a	O
conclusion	O
that	O
was	O
not	O
just	O

,	O
that	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
murder	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
do	O
