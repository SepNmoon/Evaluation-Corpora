These	O

said	O
it	O
would	O
thereby	O
do	O
me	O
a	O
great	O
service	O
,	O
and	O
do	O
themselves	O
a	O
great	O
benefit	O

because	O

I	O
would	O
comply	O
with	O
their	O
request	O

I	O
refused	O
that	O

because	O
the	O

,	O
and	O
I	O
knew	O
nothing	O

upon	O
it	O
any	O

When	O
dinner	O
was	O
ended	O
,	O
they	O
offered	O
me	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
play	O

which	O
I	O
refused	O

saying	O

I	O
should	O
be	O
late	O
in	O
the	O
night	O

and	O
was	O
not	O
well	O

and	O
that	O
I	O
rather	O
chose	O
to	O
go	O
home	O
than	O
lose	O
myself	O
in	O
the	O
streets	O
of	O
London	O
.	O
I	O
told	O
them	O
where	O
I	O
lodged	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
them	O
directions	O
on	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O

I	O
should	O
go	O

They	O
brought	O
me	O
back	O

I	O
parted	O
with	O
them	O
desi	O
ring	O
them	O
not	O

to	O

breakfast	O
with	O
me	O
as	O

The	O
Sunday	O

I	O
went	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
round	O
in	O
the	O
Park	O

I	O
met	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
about	O
Charing-Cross	O
:	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
where	O
I	O
was	O

to	O
the	O

him	O

He	O
said	O
they	O
had	O
something	O

We	O
parted	O

and	O
I	O
waited	O
for	O
them	O

about	O
four	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
in	O
the	O
Park	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O

them	O

I	O
was	O
some	O
time	O
after	O
without	O

of	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
about	O
ten	O
or	O
twelve	O
days	O
after	O
I	O
met	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
upon	O
the	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
met	O
him	O
apropos	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
extremely	O
glad	O
to	O

He	O

to	O
go	O
to	O
his	O
house	O
,	O
having	O
something	O
to	O

me	O

He	O
brought	O
me	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
public	O

near	O
the	O
Royal	O
Exchange	O
;	O
I	O
can	O
not	O

he	O
there	O
renewed	O
this	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
and	O
told	O
me	O
his	O
distress	O
,	O
which	O
moved	O
me	O
extremely	O
,	O
as	O
being	O
of	O
the	O

country	O
.	O
He	O
said	O
,	O
Since	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
accept	O
our	O
bills	O
,	O
and	O
will	O
not	O
trust	O
us	O
,	O

you	O
another	O

,	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
certain	O
you	O
will	O
agree	O
to	O
.	O
They	O
asked	O
me	O
the	O
sum	O
of	O
two	O
thousand	O
two	O
hundred	O
livres	O
,	O
which	O
makes	O
ninety-two	O
Louis	O
d'ors	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
they	O
would	O
give	O
me	O
effects	O
to	O
the	O
value	O
at	O
least	O
of	O
that	O
sum	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
I	O
might	O

of	O
the	O
day	O

,	O
as	O
any	O

me	O
the	O
money	O
which	O
they	O
had	O

they	O
would	O
do	O
:	O
but	O
they	O
said	O
they	O
must	O
have	O
money	O
,	O
else	O
they	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
most	O
imminent	O
danger	O
of	O
being	O
arrested	O
,	O
and	O
brought	O
to	O
prison	O
for	O
debt	O
.	O
They	O
insisted	O
upon	O
it	O
;	O
that	O
their	O
departure	O
for	O
France	O
was	O
extremely	O
necessary	O
to	O
be	O
soon	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
a	O
delay	O
was	O
very	O
disadvantageous	O
to	O
them	O
.	O
I	O
asked	O
them	O
what	O
goods	O
they	O
were	O
;	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
was	O
plate	O
,	O
and	O
golden	O
buckles	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
goods	O
for	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
not	O
real	O
gold	O
;	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
got	O
linen	O
and	O
other	O
effects	O
.	O
I	O
promised	O
them	O
to	O
do	O
all	O
that	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
power	O
to	O
oblige	O
them	O
,	O
and	O
if	O
the	O

,	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
.	O
Having	O
passed	O
my	O
word	O
,	O
I	O
gave	O
them	O
directly	O
on	O
account	O
twelve	O
Louis	O
d'ors	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
told	O
me	O
they	O
wanted	O
immediately	O
:	O
the	O
same	O
evening	O
they	O
came	O
to	O
my	O
lodging	O
,	O
and	O
agreed	O
to	O
bring	O
me	O
all	O
these	O
effects	O
at	O
seven	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
did	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
appointed	O

I	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
in	O
my	O
bed-gown	O

with	O
the	O
plate	O

linen	O
,	O
and	O
delivered	O
them	O
to	O
me	O

I	O
desired	O
them	O
to	O
come	O
up	O
into	O
my	O
room	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
refused	O
:	O
they	O
asked	O
me	O
for	O
eighty	O
Louis	O
d'ors	O
,	O
which	O
was	O
the	O
remainder	O
of	O
the	O
sum	O
we	O
agreed	O
for	O
.	O
One	O
of	O
them	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
settle	O
the	O
affair	O
,	O
the	O
other	O
went	O
to	O
fetch	O
scales	O
to	O
weigh	O
the	O
plate	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
come	O
back	O
.	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
sack	O
and	O
bag	O
into	O
my	O
room	O
under	O
my	O
bed-gown	O
at	O
two	O
turns	O
,	O
and	O
delivered	O
them	O
the	O
money	O
.	O
I	O
waited	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
scales	O
,	O
but	O
heard	O
no	O
more	O
of	O
him	O
.	O
At	O
twelve	O
o'clock	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
uneasy	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
opened	O
the	O
sack	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
the	O
plate	O
in	O
it	O
;	O
the	O
same	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
found	O
in	O
my	O
possession	O
.	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
less	O
surprised	O
to	O
find	O
in	O
the	O
other	O
bag	O
linen	O
,	O
wearing	O
apparel	O
,	O
and	O
things	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
expect	O
.	O
I	O
discovered	O
a	O
key	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
took	O
and	O
put	O
into	O
my	O
pocket	O
,	O
being	O
resolved	O
to	O
remit	O
that	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
the	O
next	O
time	O
I	O
should	O
see	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
belonged	O
to	O
them	O
.	O
I	O
found	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
bag	O
,	O
files	O
,	O
a	O
hammer	O
,	O
and	O
other	O
tools	O
that	O
have	O
been	O
produced	O
here	O
.	O
The	O
disappearing	O
of	O
these	O
people	O
made	O
me	O
reflect	O
bitterly	O
upon	O
my	O
imprudence	O
.	O
I	O
saw	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
deceived	O
.	O
From	O
that	O
very	O
moment	O
I	O
sought	O
an	O
occasion	O
of	O
getting	O
rid	O
of	O
these	O
effects	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
keep	O
in	O
my	O
possession	O
,	O
suspecting	O
them	O
,	O
particularly	O
as	O
the	O
plate	O
was	O
defaced	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
stamp	O
or	O
French	O
,	O
or	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
plate	O
it	O
was	O
.	O
I	O
took	O
two	O
spoons	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
shew	O
to	O
a	O
silvermith	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
,	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
they	O
were	O
of	O
the	O
English	O
stamp	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
without	O
telling	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
quantity	O
.	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
for	O
his	O
advice	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
suspected	O
something	O
,	O
as	O
the	O
arms	O
were	O
defaced	O
.	O
In	O
the	O
conversation	O
,	O
I	O
asked	O
the	O
man	O
,	O
who	O
could	O
talk	O
French	O
,	O
in	O
what	O
manner	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
such	O
plate	O
;	O
he	O
replied	O
,	O
The	O
only	O
way	O
was	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
among	O
the	O
Jews	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
the	O
only	O
men	O
that	O
could	O
make	O
such	O
bargains	O
.	O
Having	O
lost	O
ninety-two	O
guineas	O
,	O
made	O
me	O
think	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
recover	O
myself	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
possible	O
was	O
to	O
sell	O
it	O
.	O
The	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
saw	O
a	O
man	O
that	O
looked	O
like	O
a	O
Jew	O
;	O
he	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
buy	O
some	O
stockings	O
.	O
I	O
refused	O
.	O
On	O
the	O
Monday	O
following	O
I	O
met	O
the	O
man	O
again	O
upon	O
the	O
Change	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
agreed	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
sell	O
this	O
plate	O
.	O
He	O
shewed	O
me	O
a	O
public	O
house	O
where	O
I	O
might	O
find	O
him	O
.	O
I	O
took	O
coach	O
and	O
brought	O
it	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
he	O
offered	O
me	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
three	O
hundred	O
and	O
odd	O
livers	O
upon	O
Paris	O
for	O
that	O
plate	O
.	O
After	O
he	O
had	O
weighted	O
the	O
plate	O
,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
fetch	O
the	O
money	O
.	O
He	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
back	O
,	O
and	O
left	O
me	O
with	O
other	O
Jews	O
.	O
When	O
he	O
returned	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
much	O
surprised	O
when	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
he	O
wanted	O
to	O
arrest	O
me	O
.	O
All	O
this	O
was	O
to	O
frighten	O
me	O
,	O
to	O
get	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
plate	O
.	O
I	O
made	O
some	O
difficulty	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
them	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
there	O
was	O
any	O
suspicion	O
about	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
arrested	O
.	O
They	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
other	O
way	O
of	O
getting	O
rid	O
of	O
the	O
affair	O
,	O
than	O
to	O
accept	O
a	O
bill	O
of	O
three	O
hundred	O
livers	O
upon	O
Paris	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
take	O
the	O
plate	O
upon	O
themselves	O
.	O
Then	O
they	O
proposed	O
to	O
pay	O
me	O
forty	O
guineas	O
at	O
eight	O
days	O
,	O
after	O
they	O
had	O
sold	O
the	O
plate	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
could	O
not	O
do	O
in	O
this	O
city	O
.	O
All	O
these	O
proposals	O
seemed	O
unreasonable	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
rejected	O
them	O
.	O
Then	O
they	O
wanted	O
a	O
constable	O
.	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
was	O
frighted	O
;	O
I	O
looked	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
as	O
an	O
artifice	O
of	O
deception	O
.	O
There	O
came	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
who	O
has	O
appeared	O
here	O
with	O
a	O
stick	O

who	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
accepted	O

They	O
had	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
people	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
;	O
they	O
all	O
spoke	O
English	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
understand	O
what	O
they	O
said	O
.	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
be	O
frighted	O
;	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
back-door	O
,	O
which	O
stood	O
half-open	O
.	O
I	O
took	O
care	O
to	O
run	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
fear	O

to	O

the	O
silver	O

the	O

it	O

which	O
