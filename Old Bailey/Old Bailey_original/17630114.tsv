knew	O
one	O
Reed	O

and	O
if	O
he	O
lived	O
in	O
that	O

his	O
answer	O
was	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

such	O
a	O

upon	O
finding	O
him	O
a	O
German	O
,	O
I	O
accosted	O
him	O
in	O

he	O

I	O

that	O
a	O
man	O

all	O
that	O

told	O
that	O
the	O

such	O
that	O

then	O
took	O
me	O
a-side	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
German	O

said	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
rather	O
surprized	O
that	O
the	O

that	O

publicly	O
who	O
the	O

was	O
that	O
brought	O
him	O
the	O

then	O
told	O
me	O
,	O
the	O

where	O
