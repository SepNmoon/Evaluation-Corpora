but	O
a	O
very	O
few	O
minutes	O
before	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
appearance	O
about	O
him	O
that	O
alarmed	O
and	O
frightened	O
her	O
much	O
;	O
a	O
very	O
little	O
conversation	O
took	O
place	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
seems	O
the	O
conversation	O
was	O
of	O
this	O
kind	O
;	O
she	O
intimated	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O

that	O
he	O
was	O
connected	O

on	O

to	O
her	O

that	O
his	O

he	O
instantly	O
took	O
a	O
knife	O
that	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O
shop	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
considerably	O
alarmed	O
,	O
and	O
retreating	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
she	O
ran	O
into	O
the	O
parlour	O
;	O
he	O
followed	O
her	O

and	O
instantly	O
rushed	O
upon	O
her	O
;	O
he	O
got	O
her	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O

made	O
a	O
stab	O
at	O
her	O

meeting	O
the	O
resistance	O

broke	O

shop	O
a	O
second	O
time	O

returned	O
with	O
another	O

most	O
deadly	O
instrument	O
;	O

The	O

is	O
that	O
which	O
goes	O

upon	O
this	O

taken	O
place	O
by	O

under	O
circumstances	O
,	O
which	O
the	O
evidence	O
before	O
your	O

does	O
not	O
sustain	O

I	O
am	O
not	O
uninformed	O
that	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
modes	O
of	O
death	O

which	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
charged	O
with	O
perfect	O
accuracy	O
in	O
the	O
indictment	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
charged	O
with	O
something	O
approaching	O
to	O
accuracy	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
clear	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
the	O
death	O
imputed	O
in	O
the	O
indictment	O

different	O
and	O
variable	O
in	O
any	O

degree	O

defendant	O
will	O

an	O
acquittal	O

This	O
has	O

In	O
the	O

the	O
indictment	O
charges	O

the	O
death	O

the	O

confine	O
myself	O

death	O
by	O

by	O

so	O

within	O
that	O
distinction	O

the	O
ancient	O
wisdom	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
has	O
laid	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
entitles	O
the	O
defendant	O
to	O
his	O
acquittal	O

I	O
am	O
aware	O
that	O
the	O
surgeons	O
have	O
delivered	O
their	O
opinion	O
that	O
the	O
death	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
an	O
extravasation	O
of	O
blood	O
which	O
filled	O
the	O
cavity	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
in	O
their	O
judgment	O
that	O
was	O
occasioned	O
by	O
an	O
external	O
violence	O
opposed	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
