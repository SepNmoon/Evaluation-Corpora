whether	O

either	O

should	O
turn	O
out	O
that	O
one	O
of	O

make	O
a	O
distinction	O
in	O
your	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
will	O
just	O
state	O
to	O

this	O
case	O

one	O
observation	O

and	O
I	O
would	O
wish	O
you	O
to	O
carry	O
that	O
observation	O
in	O
your	O
minds	O
throughout	O
;	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
that	O
this	O
case	O
will	O
very	O
much	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
lady	O
who	O
has	O
been	O
examined	O
.	O
It	O
generally	O
happens	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

robbed	O
,	O
is	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
unless	O
they	O
are	O
acquainted	O
with	O
the	O
party	O
robbing	O
before-hand	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
sometimes	O
extremely	O
difficult	O
afterwards	O
to	O
swear	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
;	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
an	O
act	O
of	O
this	O
sort	O
is	O
attended	O
with	O
great	O
terrors	O
,	O
particularly	O
if	O
the	O
person	O
happens	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
female	O
;	O
one	O
does	O
not	O
at	O
all	O
wonder	O
at	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
that	O
reason	O

where	O
there	O
is	O
only	O
one	O
person	O
in	O
company	O
,	O
who	O
can	O
speak	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O

surely	O
we	O
must	O
hear	O
the	O

with	O
great	O
attention	O

great	O
distrust	O

not	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
honesty	O

fairness	O
of	O
the	O

but	O
as	O
to	O
that	O
sort	O
of	O
uncertainty	O
in	O
which	O
the	O

is	O
frequently	O
under	O

which	O
reason	O
I	O
always	O
look	O
for	O

I	O
am	O
very	O
happy	O
when	O
I	O
find	O
some	O
corroborating	O
circumstances	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

not	O
mistaken	O

as	O
to	O
the	O
person	O
of	O
