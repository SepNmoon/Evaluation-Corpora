has	O
laid	O
down	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
his	O
speech	O
,	O
I	O
perfectly	O
coincide	O
with	O
every	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
;	O
I	O
agree	O
that	O
if	O
taxes	O
are	O
imposed	O
the	O
collectors	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
protected	O
;	O
I	O
also	O
perfectly	O
coincide	O
with	O
him	O
in	O
the	O
character	O
which	O
he	O
has	O
thought	O
proper	O
to	O
point	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
present	O
worthy	O
Attorney	O
General	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
agree	O
with	O
him	O
to	O
the	O
full	O
extent	O
of	O
that	O
description	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
perfectly	O
convinced	O
,	O
and	O
very	O
ready	O
to	O
declare	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
more	O
honourable	O
man	O
in	O
the	O
situation	O
which	O
he	O
now	O
fills	O
,	O
never	O
was	O
placed	O
in	O
that	O
situation	O

But	O
having	O
got	O
rid	O
of	O
that	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
again	O
necessarily	O
driven	O
to	O
the	O
question	O
which	O
you	O
are	O
to	O

and	O
the	O
question	O
that	O
my	O
learned	O
friend	O

Mr	O

Fielding	O
,	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
certainly	O

lay	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
compass	O
indeed	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
real	O
question	O
on	O
this	O
record	O
is	O
,	O
whether	O
the	O
prisoner	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
assaulted	O
,	O
hindered	O
,	O
opposed	O
and	O
obstructed	O
Mr.	O

who	O
states	O
himself	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
collector	O
of	O
excise	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
execution	O
of	O
his	O
duty	O

gentlemen	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
judge	O
on	O
this	O
case	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
necessary	O
to	O
advert	O
to	O
the	O
evidence	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
think	O
Andrews	O
has	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
under	O
the	O
correction	O
of	O
his	O
Lordship	O
if	O
I	O
am	O
wrong	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
recollect	O
which	O
of	O
the	O
persons	O
,	O
either	O
Cooper	O
or	O
whether	O
the	O
other	O
person	O
knocked	O
him	O
down	O
,	O
certainly	O
I	O
am	O
right	O
,	O
though	O
corrected	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Garrow	O
;	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
knock	O
him	O
down	O
.	O
Now	O
we	O
will	O
see	O
whether	O
I	O
am	O
correct	O
and	O
right	O
;	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
strike	O
him	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
in	O
the	O
recollection	O
of	O
every	O
body	O
that	O
hears	O
me	O
;	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
first	O
asked	O
he	O
did	O
say	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
ever	O
struck	O
him	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
pressed	O
a	O
little	O
,	O
he	O
does	O
say	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
person	O
that	O
struck	O
him	O
several	O
blows	O
on	O
the	O
arm	O
and	O
head	O
;	O
so	O
that	O
by	O
the	O
exertion	O
of	O
that	O
ingenuity	O
,	O
which	O
you	O
have	O
often	O
had	O
opportunitiesto	O
admire	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
brought	O
to	O
say	O
at	O
last	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
strike	O
him	O
;	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
material	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
have	O
produced	O
this	O
woman	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
could	O
possibly	O
have	O
identified	O
the	O
person	O
brought	O
to	O
her	O
to	O
be	O
Andrews	O
;	O
instead	O
of	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
in	O
which	O
Andrews	O
himself	O
stated	O
it	O
first	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
altered	O
his	O
tone	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
you	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
woman	O

who	O
says	O
she	O
does	O
not	O
know	O
a	O
single	O
feature	O
in	O

against	O
the	O
defendant	O

who	O
comes	O
here	O
upon	O
his	O
own	O
surrender	O

that	O
which	O
neither	O
of	O
the	O
witnesses	O
have	O
dared	O
to	O
state	O
;	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
single	O
question	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
,	O
under	O
circumstances	O
that	O
certainly	O
on	O
their	O
own	O
testimony	O
have	O
made	O
it	O
doubtful	O
;	O
but	O
thank	O
God	O
it	O
is	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
decide	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
for	O
any	O
one	O

in	O
this	O
Court	O

My	O

Mr	O

to	O
the	O
inconvenience	O
of	O

tried	O
here	O

at	O
the	O

time	O

very	O

this	O
act	O

Mr	O

Fielding	O
certainly	O
on	O
this	O
occasion	O
blows	O
a	O
little	O
hot	O
and	O
cold	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
necessary	O
for	O
the	O
justice	O
of	O
the	O
country	O
that	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
should	O
protect	O
the	O
officers	O
in	O
the	O
collection	O

it	O
is	O

that	O

be	O
had	O
where	O
they	O
shall	O
have	O
a	O
fair	O
and	O
impartial	O
one	O
;	O
but	O
surely	O
it	O
is	O
of	O
equal	O
service	O
to	O
individuals	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
have	O
opportunity	O

poor	O

they	O
are	O

particularly	O
in	O
these	O

that	O

might	O

the	O

some	O
witnesses	O

and	O
in	O
order	O
to	O

in	O
their	O

farther	O

they	O
might	O
have	O
witnesses	O
if	O
the	O
act	O
of	O
parliament	O
had	O
given	O
them	O
means	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
you	O
will	O
presume	O
it	O
so	O
to	O
have	O
stated	O
some	O
facts	O

might	O
