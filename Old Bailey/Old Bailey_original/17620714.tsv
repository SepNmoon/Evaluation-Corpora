Orput	O

We	O
have	O
found	O
great	O
deficiencies	O
of	O
gold	O

wanting	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
what	O
was	O
given	O
him	O
to	O

We	O
sent	O
for	O
him	O
to	O
know	O
how	O
he	O
could	O
account	O
for	O
it	O
.	O
He	O
said	O
he	O
himself	O
was	O
innocent	O
of	O
it	O
;	O

he	O
mistrusted	O
Orput	O
his	O

,	O
we	O
thought	O
it	O

said	O
he	O
knew	O
nothing	O

seemed	O

confused	O
;	O

carried	O

on	O
the	O
12th	O

When	O
we	O

him	O
in	O

,	O
that	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O

shewn	O
him	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
confess	O

otherwise	O

would	O
be	O
