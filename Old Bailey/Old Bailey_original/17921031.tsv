there	O

that	O
if	O
the	O

me	O

the	O

therefore	O
I	O
was	O
determined	O
to	O
walk	O
on	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
him	O
;	O

I	O
went	O

through	O
the	O
church	O
yard	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
that	O

the	O

said	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
money	O
before	O
I	O
went	O
any	O
further	O
;	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
only	O
half-a-crown	O
;	O
he	O
then	O
insisted	O
he	O
would	O
rifle	O
my	O
pockets	O
;	O
he	O
put	O
his	O
hands	O
into	O
my	O

,	O
and	O
attempted	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
into	O
my	O

,	O
which	O
I	O
would	O
not	O
suffer	O
;	O
my	O
alarm	O
encreased	O
;	O
I	O
went	O
into	O
Bishopsgate-street	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
more	O
trouble	O
some	O
and	O
louder	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
go	O
no	O
further	O
;	O
he	O
said	O
if	O
I	O
did	O
comply	O
,	O
and	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
guinea	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
leave	O
me	O
immediately	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
should	O
never	O
see	O
him	O
again	O
;	O
I	O
there	O
considered	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
every	O
thing	O
at	O
stake	O
,	O
and	O
perhaps	O
my	O
life	O
;	O
if	O

my	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
would	O
walk	O
quietly	O
along	O
I	O
would	O
give	O
him	O
a	O
guinea	O

if	O
that	O
would	O
relieve	O
his	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
under	O
this	O
consideration	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
attacked	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
street	O
the	O
mob	O
would	O
not	O
think	O
as	O
they	O
ought	O

and	O
that	O

for	O
that	O
,	O

that	O
only	O
