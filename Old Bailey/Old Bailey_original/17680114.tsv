Q	O

Why	O
so	O

Hodgson	O

Because	O
I	O

was	O
a	O

part	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
;	O
I	O
gave	O
every	O
body	O
an	O
opportunity	O

because	O
I	O
wished	O
that	O
every	O

should	O
be	O
satisfied	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
charge	O
brought	O
in	O

the	O

in	O
what	O
way	O
did	O
he	O
bring	O
them	O
?	O
Hodgson	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
continually	O
in	O
doubt	O
about	O
it	O
;	O
I	O
had	O
various	O
accounts	O
from	O
various	O
people	O
,	O
people	O
that	O
were	O
thorough	O
masters	O
of	O

I	O
took	O
great	O

in	O
it	O

Q	O

What	O
was	O
the	O
demand	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
side	O
?	O
Hodgson	O
.	O
The	O
demand	O
amounted	O
to	O
2600	O
l.	O
or	O
thereabouts	O
for	O
provision	O
,	O
for	O
wages	O
,	O
and	O
various	O
other	O
things	O
;	O
money	O
he	O
had	O
paid	O
,	O
commissions	O
for	O
getting	O
the	O
ship	O
supplied	O
,	O
and	O
expences	O
on	O
shore	O
,	O
and	O
many	O
things	O
that	O
constitutes	O
the	O
Captain	O
's	O
demand	O
;	O
I	O
desired	O
the	O
two	O
attornies	O
to	O
both	O
attend	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
vouchers	O
brought	O
;	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
book	O
and	O
crossed	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
material	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
through	O
the	O
whole	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
the	O
first	O
meeting	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
made	O
no	O
judgment	O
of	O
them	O
then	O
,	O
but	O
laid	O
them	O
by	O
;	O
this	O
was	O
held	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Lee	O
's	O
presence	O
,	O
from	O
about	O
eight	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
till	O
between	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
in	O
the	O
afternoon	O
;	O
then	O
I	O
desired	O
they	O
would	O
agree	O
whether	O
that	O
was	O
right	O
cast	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
;	O
Capt	O
.	O
Smith	O
was	O
a	O
stranger	O
to	O
me	O
at	O
this	O
time	O
;	O
I	O
found	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
writer	O
,	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
much	O
of	O
figures	O
;	O
after	O
some	O
altercations	O
,	O
and	O
seemingly	O
a	O
good	O
deal	O
of	O
ill-nature	O
from	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Lem	O
did	O
come	O
and	O
enter	O
into	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
account	O
of	O
Capt	O
.	O
Smith	O
.	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
set-off	O
which	O
extinguished	O
every	O
article	O
,	O
but	O
no	O
talk	O
of	O
forgeries	O
;	O
then	O
they	O
insinuated	O
that	O
the	O
Captain	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
man	O
,	O
and	O
abused	O
him	O
very	O
much	O
;	O
I	O
understood	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
very	O
bad	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
very	O
much	O
shocked	O
in	O
being	O
concerned	O
in	O
the	O
business	O
;	O
but	O
as	O
Mr.	O
Lee	O
said	O
he	O
would	O
attend	O
me	O
,	O
I	O
did	O
call	O
another	O
meeting	O
;	O
the	O
second	O
meeting	O
was	O
the	O
23d	O
of	O
September	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
account	O
produced	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
in	O
behalf	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
,	O
the	O
attornies	O
were	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
their	O
clerks	O
;	O
I	O
examined	O
the	O
set-off	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
2300	O
l.	O
they	O
have	O
the	O
account	O
;	O
my	O
Lord	O
Mansfield	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
but	O
with	O
that	O
one	O
particular	O
voyage	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Dunbar	O
was	O
the	O
owner	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
signed	O
his	O
interest	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
;	O
I	O
examined	O
the	O
set-off	O
,	O
and	O
found	O
it	O
amounted	O
to	O
mere	O
nothing	O
,	O
either	O
in	O
one	O
way	O
or	O
the	O
other	O
;	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
amount	O
to	O
I	O
think	O
an	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
;	O
in	O
short	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
generally	O
given	O
up	O
by	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
and	O
his	O
friends	O
to	O
about	O
an	O
hundred	O
pounds	O
,	O
that	O
regarded	O
that	O
voyage	O
;	O
the	O
other	O
had	O
been	O
settled	O
and	O
agreed	O
before	O
with	O
Mr.	O
Dunbar	O
;	O
however	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
disputed	O
article	O
between	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
,	O
which	O
amounted	O
to	O
about	O
200	O
l.	O
the	O
Captain	O
said	O
he	O
had	O
paid	O
great	O
part	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
there	O
were	O
words	O
arose	O
upon	O
that	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
recommended	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
settle	O
that	O
between	O
themselves	O
;	O
Green	O
and	O
Trinder	O
would	O
not	O
settle	O
it	O
;	O
this	O
set-off	O
failing	O
so	O
extraordinarily	O
alarmed	O
me	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
conceive	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
amusing	O
of	O
me	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Dunbar	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
's	O
accounts	O
were	O
so	O
very	O
intricate	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
behaved	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
in	O
that	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
sorry	O
that	O
had	O
been	O
produced	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
settled	O
in	O
other	O
accounts	O
,	O
that	O
was	O
2308	O
l.	O
there	O
were	O
hints	O
thrown	O
out	O
of	O
forgeries	O
after	O
this	O
set-off	O
;	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
were	O
some	O
insinuations	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
began	O
to	O
blaze	O
gradually	O
;	O
I	O
begged	O
of	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
large	O
sum	O
of	O
money	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
Captain	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
it	O
by	O
an	O
average	O
;	O
I	O
consulted	O
Captains	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
their	O
opinions	O
on	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
Mr.	O
Smith	O
no	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
such	O
circumstances	O
should	O
have	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
voyage	O
;	O
I	O
said	O
to	O
the	O
others	O
if	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
bring	O
better	O
accounts	O
than	O
these	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
Captain	O

very	O
little	O
;	O
Mr.	O
Reynolds	O
told	O
him	O
to	O

gave	O
something	O
the	O

now	O

I	O
believe	O
the	O
Captain	O
was	O
extreamly	O
uneasy	O
;	O
they	O
asked	O
about	O
the	O

did	O

who	O
not	O
:	O
I	O
then	O
examined	O
Glading	O

the	O

account	O

has	O
now	O

took	O
off	O

Mr.	O

I	O
agreed	O
at	O
the	O
meeting	O

Mr.	O

Mr.	O

they	O

on	O
Mr.	O
Reynolds	O

I	O
think	O
Mr.	O
Green	O
was	O
the	O
man	O
that	O
seized	O
it	O
.	O
Green	O
.	O
The	O
reason	O
that	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
bag	O
was	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Hodgson	O
said	O
there	O
were	O
things	O
of	O
a	O
serious	O
nature	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
foul	O
his	O

them	O
;	O
he	O
would	O
not	O

I	O

the	O

as	O
Mr.	O

seemed	O
to	O

he	O

forgeries	O

his	O
hands	O

I	O
was	O
afraid	O
the	O

Q	O

What	O
was	O
your	O
reason	O

was	O
a	O
balance	O
of	O
2100	O
l.	O
due	O
to	O
him	O
?	O
Green	O
.	O
The	O
reason	O
was	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
first	O
account	O
he	O
delivered	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Trinder	O
amounted	O
to	O
no	O
more	O

1752	O

8	O
d.	O

the	O

to	O
3560	O

it	O
was	O
declared	O
that	O
Mr.	O
