along	O

my	O

it	O
seems	O
some	O
of	O
his	O
books	O
were	O
mix	O
'd	O
with	O
them	O

which	O
Mr.	O

inform	O
'd	O

he	O
came	O

found	O
them	O
in	O
my	O
custody	O

thereupon	O
founded	O
his	O
process	O
of	O
felony	O
against	O

but	O
how	O
this	O
should	O
have	O
happened	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
conjecture	O
,	O
unless	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
thro	O
'	O

inadvertently	O
owing	O

and	O
if	O
this	O
was	O
really	O
the	O
case	O

me	O
thinks	O
it	O
was	O
sufficient	O
to	O
excuse	O
the	O
matter	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Baker	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
disposed	O
to	O
treat	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
smallest	O
degree	O
of	O
candour	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
seems	O
he	O
was	O
determined	O
to	O
prosecute	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
greatest	O
virulence	O
;	O
and	O
indeed	O
he	O
seems	O
in	O
this	O
whole	O
affair	O
to	O
have	O
acted	O
from	O
a	O
principle	O
of	O
revenge	O
,	O
and	O
to	O
have	O
been	O
impatiently	O
thirsting	O
for	O
my	O
blood	O
,	O
so	O
that	O
nothing	O
less	O
would	O
satisfy	O
his	O
malicious	O
resentment	O
than	O
that	O
my	O
life	O
should	O
be	O
made	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
to	O
his	O
revenge	O

methinks	O
