Mr.	O

that	O

not	O

,	O
I	O
do	O

avoid	O
examining	O
him	O

what	O

it	O
goes	O
very	O

I	O
doubt	O
very	O
much	O
,	O
whether	O
he	O

in	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
an	O
accomplice	O

my	O
idea	O
of	O
an	O
accomplice	O
is	O
a	O
person	O
that	O
confesses	O
himself	O
guilty	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
fact	O
the	O
prisoner	O
is	O
accused	O
of	O
;	O

this	O

does	O
not	O
stand	O
charged	O
by	O
his	O
own	O
confession	O
,	O
or	O
otherwise	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
one	O
crime	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
crime	O
greatly	O
affecting	O
his	O
credit	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
crime	O
of	O
receiving	O
these	O
goods	O
after	O
the	O
fact	O
committed	O
,	O
knowing	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
stolen	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
Court	O
and	O
Jury	O
ought	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
witness	O
with	O
great	O
caution	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
doubt	O

whether	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
principle	O
of	O

that	O
I	O
can	O
decline	O

him	O
upon	O
;	O
if	O

on	O
the	O

to	O
be	O
an	O
