rather	O
than	O
strict	O

the	O
only	O
difficulty	O
I	O
feel	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
is	O
,	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
servant	O
not	O
having	O
been	O

but	O
my	O
present	O
sentiments	O
on	O
that	O
subject	O
are	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
ought	O
not	O
to	O
prevent	O
the	O
letter	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
Jury	O
,	O
subject	O
to	O
the	O
observations	O
which	O
may	O
be	O
made	O
upon	O
it	O
of	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O

may	O

prove	O
it	O

him	O

The	O
ground	O
of	O
my	O
reason	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
Colonel	O
Gordon	O
's	O
servant	O
is	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
brings	O
the	O
letter	O
to	O
Colonel	O
Thomas	O
,	O
to	O
which	O
this	O
letter	O
is	O
an	O
answer	O
,	O
therefore	O
he	O
makes	O
his	O
servant	O
the	O
agent	O
,	O
first	O
to	O
bring	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
to	O
receive	O
the	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
answer	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
evident	O
that	O
that	O
letter	O
did	O
come	O
to	O
the	O
hands	O
of	O
Colonel	O
Gordon	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
admissible	O
evidence	O
,	O
though	O
not	O
conclusive	O
:	O
in	O
a	O
criminal	O
case	O
notice	O
is	O
not	O
necessary	O
to	O
the	O
party	O
accused	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
lays	O
no	O
obligation	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
the	O
person	O
to	O
produce	O
the	O
paper	O
called	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
best	O
evidence	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
admitted	O
upon	O
that	O
ground	O
,	O
namely	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
party	O
upon	O
notice	O
has	O
refused	O
to	O

the	O

it	O

the	O

also	O
may	O
