to	O

shall	O

application	O

being	O
illegally	O
detained	O
in	O

that	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
admit	O
a	O

It	O
is	O
impossible	O

observer	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
aware	O
that	O
there	O
may	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
be	O
a	O
previous	O
enquiry	O
necessary	O
:	O
such	O
is	O
the	O
humanity	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
in	O
England	O
,	O
that	O
in	O
all	O
stages	O

both	O
when	O
the	O
act	O
is	O
committed	O

at	O
the	O
time	O

the	O

makes	O
his	O
defence	O
,	O
and	O
even	O
at	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
execution	O

it	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
settle	O
what	O
his	O
state	O

is	O
;	O
and	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
he	O
is	O
called	O
to	O

,	O
if	O
there	O
are	O
circumstances	O
that	O

that	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
possession	O

,	O
we	O
must	O
certainly	O
be	O
careful	O
that	O
nothing	O
is	O
introduced	O

the	O
administration	O

what	O

justice	O

think	O
there	O
ought	O
now	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
enquiry	O
made	O

touching	O
the	O
sanity	O

whether	O
