That	O
William	B-pers

was	O
charged	O
with	O
having	O
printed	O
and	O
published	O
a	O
libel	O
as	O
false	O
in	O
its	O
assertion	O
,	O
as	O
it	O

in	O
its	O

That	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
the	O
year	O
1780	O
,	O
a	O
bill	O
was	O
brought	O

the	O

some	O

were	O
a	O

any	O

The	O
object	O
of	O
that	O
bill	O
was	O
not	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
falsely	O
represented	O
,	O
a	O
design	O
of	O
giving	O
any	O
countenance	O
to	O
a	O
religion	O
so	O
opposite	O
to	O
the	O
genius	O
of	O
a	O
free	O
country	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
sole	O
object	O
was	O
to	O
repeal	O
some	O
cruel	O
and	O
sanguinary	O
laws	O
,	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
enacted	O
in	O
the	O
days	O

so	O

notwithstanding	O
this	O

had	O
passed	O
with	O
the	O
unanimous	O
consent	O
of	O

,	O
some	O
men	O
thought	O
this	O
law	O
had	O
passed	O
improperly	O
;	O
a	O
very	O
small	O
body	O
of	O
men	O
,	O
at	O
first	O
,	O
had	O
thought	O
fit	O
to	O
complain	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
making	O
use	O
of	O
arguments	O
to	O
delude	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
had	O
procured	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
and	O
formidable	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
join	O
in	O
a	O
petition	O
for	O
a	O
repeal	O
of	O
that	O
law	O
.	O
I	O
from	O
my	O
heart	O
believed	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
motives	O
were	O
very	O
laudable	O
in	O
petitioning	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
from	O
my	O
heart	O
also	O
believe	O
,	O
that	O
their	O
minds	O
were	O
imposed	O
upon	O
by	O
arguments	O
,	O
and	O
artifices	O
of	O
designing	O
men	O

who	O

other	O
purposes	O
in	O

The	O
petition	O
to	O

being	O
rejected	O

produced	O
a	O
very	O
considerable	O
ferment	O
in	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
some	O
people	O
,	O
and	O
there	O

some	O
people	O
so	O
lost	O
to	O
their	O
duties	O
,	O
to	O
their	O
fellow	O
citizens	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
determined	O
by	O
acts	O
of	O
violence	O
to	O
loosen	O
the	O
bands	O
of	O
society	O
,	O
to	O
repeal	O
that	O
act	O
,	O
every	O
one	O
remembers	O
the	O
acts	O
of	O
violence	O
committed	O
on	O
the	O
very	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
petition	O
