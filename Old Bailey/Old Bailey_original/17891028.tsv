avoid	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
stating	O
to	O
you	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
Lasceter	O
,	O
because	O
I	O
wish	O
you	O
to	O
consider	O
this	O
case	O
as	O
you	O
go	O
along	O
,	O
always	O
remembering	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
to	O
attend	O
to	O
any	O
thing	O
that	O
is	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
from	O
the	O
bar	O

unless	O
it	O
comes	O
out	O
upon	O
proof	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
wish	O
you	O
to	O
bear	O
upon	O
your	O
minds	O
the	O
different	O
degrees	O
of	O
guilt	O
which	O
attach	O
to	O
these	O
prisoners	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
different	O
stages	O

always	O

how	O
much	O
of	O
that	O
guilt	O
has	O
attached	O
before	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
the	O
accomplice	O

to	O

The	O
evidence	O
against	O
Partington	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
after	O
Lasceter	O
was	O
in	O
custody	O
,	O
he	O
of	O
course	O
had	O
given	O
information	O
,	O
which	O
led	O
to	O
enquire	O
into	O
the	O
transaction	O
;	O
and	O
Partington	O
was	O
pursued	O
into	O
the	O
country	O
;	O
Partington	O
was	O
gone	O
down	O
to	O
Liverpool	O
;	O
he	O
was	O
taken	O
at	O
Preston	O
;	O
and	O
upon	O
his	O
person	O
there	O
were	O
found	O
some	O
things	O
which	O
are	O
extremely	O
material	O
for	O
your	O
consideration	O
and	O
attention	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
lining	O
of	O
his	O
breeches	O
,	O
next	O
to	O
his	O
skin	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
,	O
which	O
you	O
have	O
seen	O
lately	O
,	O
probably	O
,	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
phosphorous	O
bottles	O

with	O
matches	O

by	O
which	O
you	O
may	O
procure	O
light	O
without	O
flint	O
and	O
steel	O
;	O
this	O
will	O
be	O
an	O
extremely	O
important	O
circumstance	O
in	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
this	O
enquiry	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
likewise	O
found	O
upon	O
him	O
two	O
keys	O
,	O
which	O
he	O
acknowledged	O
to	O
be	O
his	O
property	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
stated	O
to	O
belong	O
to	O
him	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
pocket	O
book	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
that	O
a	O
receipt	O
from	O
the	O
book-keeper	O
of	O
the	O
Axe	O
inn	O
,	O
in	O
Aldermanbury	O
,	O
for	O
two	O
boxes	O
which	O
had	O
been	O
delivered	O
,	O
as	O
will	O
be	O
proved	O
by	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
had	O
that	O
receipt	O
:	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
these	O
things	O
the	O
prisoner	O
Partington	O
stated	O
to	O
be	O
his	O
own	O
;	O
the	O
key	O
will	O
be	O
found	O
to	O
open	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
boxes	O
at	O
the	O
inn	O
in	O
Aldermanbury	O
;	O
the	O

be	O
found	O
to	O
apply	O
to	O
both	O
the	O
boxes	O
found	O
in	O
Aldermanbury	O
,	O
therefore	O
it	O
becomes	O
extremely	O
material	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
consider	O
the	O
contents	O
of	O
those	O
boxes	O
;	O
they	O
contained	O
among	O
many	O
other	O
things	O

when	O
Partington	O
was	O

was	O

among	O
the	O

he	O

Gentlemen	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
proved	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
the	O

was	O
taken	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

this	O
is	O
to	O

by	O
such	O
articles	O

in	O

this	O
it	O

that	O
the	O
two	O

for	O
some	O
nights	O

it	O
will	O
be	O
material	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
remember	O
that	O
upon	O
the	O
very	O
night	O
of	O
the	O
burglary	O
neither	O
