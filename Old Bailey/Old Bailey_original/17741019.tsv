of	O
a	O
robbery	O
that	O

at	O
the	O

Mr.	O

observed	O
a	O

of	O

there	O
;	O
he	O
asked	O
Mr.	O
Churchill	O
what	O
he	O
thought	O
of	O
those	O

;	O
he	O
replied	O
that	O
they	O
looked	O
very	O
suspicious	O
;	O
while	O
we	O
were	O
talking	O
in	O
that	O
manner	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
men	O
rushed	O
out	O
from	O
behind	O
some	O

;	O
upon	O
which	O
Mr.	O
Jackson	O
repeatedly	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
fire	O
at	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
off	O
;	O
I	O
looked	O
out	O
on	O
the	O

saw	O
another	O
man	O
running	O
after	O
the	O
coach	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
desist	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
shoot	O
at	O
him	O
;	O

he	O
kept	O
running	O
on	O

he	O
came	O
within	O
about	O
fifteen	O

the	O

;	O
I	O
believe	O
that	O
man	O
that	O
ran	O
after	O

was	O
James	B-pers

I	O
can	O

what	O
he	O

;	O
seeing	O
him	O
there	O

then	O
this	O
man	O
ran	O
a-cross	O
the	O
road	O
to	O
the	O

side	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
he	O
said	O
nothing	O
at	O
that	O

nor	O
did	O
I	O
see	O
any	O

that	O

;	O
when	O
we	O
came	O
about	O
twenty	O

another	O
man	O
rushed	O
out	O
,	O
who	O
I	O
believe	O
to	O
be	O
Tomlin	O
;	O
he	O
kept	O
on	O
our	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
coach	O
;	O
upon	O
which	O
I	O
leaned	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
presented	O
my	O
pistol	O
at	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
threatened	O
to	O
fire	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
keep	O
off	O
;	O
still	O
he	O
continued	O
to	O
pursue	O
us	O
,	O
apparently	O
with	O
a	O
design	O
to	O
reach	O
the	O
coach	O
door	O
,	O
but	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
get	O
so	O
far	O
as	O
that	O
,	O
he	O
put	O
his	O
hand	O
to	O
his	O

took	O
out	O
a	O
pistol	O
,	O

fired	O

I	O
am	O
pretty	O
sure	O
that	O
Tomlin	O
is	O
the	O
man	O
:	O
I	O
can	O
speak	O
much	O
more	O
positively	O
to	O
him	O
than	O
to	O
Knight	O

It	O
was	O
a	O

leaned	O
out	O

with	O
the	O
pistol	O
in	O
my	O

and	O
kept	O
looking	O
at	O

I	O
am	O
more	O
positive	O
to	O
his	O
person	O
than	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
to	O

Upon	O
his	O
fireing	O
I	O
opened	O
the	O

jumped	O
out	O

Mr.	O

followed	O

my	O

off	O

in	O

I	O
thought	O

two	O

in	O
the	O

thought	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
sound	O

wheels	O

and	O
from	O
a	O
curiosity	O

I	O
turned	O
about	O

what	O

were	O
at	O
that	O

down	O
in	O

out	O
