that	O

I	O
will	O

rather	O
to	O
state	O
to	O
you	O
the	O
effect	O
of	O
that	O

there	O
are	O
two	O
circumstances	O
of	O

which	O
will	O
deserve	O
your	O

;	O
the	O
first	O
is	O

whether	O
the	O

question	O
for	O
you	O

to	O
you	O

that	O
Upton	O

being	O
a	O
watchmaker	O

that	O

was	O
a	O
very	O
disagreeable	O

that	O
the	O

he	O
took	O
no	O

;	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
extremely	O

it	O
is	O
clear	O

that	O

for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
learning	O
what	O
the	O

was	O

we	O

now	O
again	O

that	O

in	O
the	O

to	O
the	O
evidence	O

Mr.	O
Ward	O

that	O
is	O
merely	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

the	O

there	O
was	O

I	O
contend	O
that	O
that	O

is	O
a	O
most	O
important	O
one	O

because	O
it	O
shews	O

have	O

that	O

no	O

suspicion	O
against	O

of	O

Penny	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
permit	O
me	O
to	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
evidence	O
of	O
declaration	O
is	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
singular	O
sort	O
;	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
say	O
any	O
thing	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
shall	O
be	O
contradicted	O
by	O
any	O
authority	O
in	O
this	O
Court	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
with	O
great	O
consideration	O
before	O
it	O
is	O
admitted	O
to	O
prove	O
a	O
fact	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
very	O
easily	O
apprehend	O
me	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
state	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
that	O
legal	O
demonstration	O
consists	O
in	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
if	O
a	O
witness	O
speaks	O
true	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
must	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
all	O
evidence	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
of	O
high	O
treason	O
,	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
person	O
being	O
out	O
in	O
rebellion	O
against	O
the	O
state	O
,	O
is	O
proved	O
legally	O
to	O
demonstration	O
;	O
but	O
when	O
evidence	O
is	O
given	O
of	O
a	O
confession	O
,	O
observe	O
what	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
-	O
the	O
person	O
who	O
gives	O
his	O
testimony	O
may	O
speak	O
truly	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
fact	O
not	O
be	O
true	O
;	O
because	O
the	O
fact	O
does	O
not	O
depend	O
upon	O
the	O
witness	O
,	O
but	O
upon	O
another	O
person	O
who	O
has	O
stated	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
witness	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
it	O
requires	O
great	O
deliberation	O
in	O
receiving	O
all	O
evidence	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
confession	O
;	O
but	O
the	O
thing	O
goes	O
much	O
further	O
than	O
that	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
founded	O
in	O
any	O
abstract	O
question	O
of	O

in	O
the	O
very	O
nature	O
of	O
things	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
the	O
nature	O
of	O

this	O

that	O
not	O

the	O
person	O
making	O
the	O

be	O
clear	O
from	O
all	O
motives	O
either	O
of	O
hope	O

of	O

so	O
tinctured	O

so	O
prepared	O

that	O
you	O
shall	O
believe	O
accurately	O
what	O

ships	O
go	O

I	O

this	O
very	O

for	O
two	O
reasons	O

first	O
of	O

in	O
the	O

under	O
the	O
necessity	O
of	O
sating	O
to	O
you	O
very	O

that	O
objection	O

The	O
