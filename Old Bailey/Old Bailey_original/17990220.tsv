at	O

Mr.	O

was	O

to	O

not	O
succeeding	O

than	O
himself	O

upon	O
his	O
recovering	O
the	O

he	O

him	O

unless	O
he	O
immediately	O

him	O
the	O
key	O
;	O
the	O
key	O
,	O
I	O

was	O
lying	O
by	O
him	O

not	O

no	O

Mr.	O

began	O

was	O
very	O
considerably	O
alarmed	O
.	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
exactly	O
know	O
,	O
he	O
will	O
describe	O
himself	O

in	O

he	O
behaved	O

There	O
was	O
another	O

in	O

an	O

,	O
of	O
the	O

seeing	O
what	O
was	O
going	O
on	O
,	O
made	O
his	O
advance	O
to	O
Turnbull	O
,	O
and	O
interrogated	O
him	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
:	O
Are	O
you	O
mad	O
,	O
are	O
you	O
in	O
your	O
senses	O
;	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
?	O
upon	O
which	O
,	O
Turnbull	O
immediately	O
forced	O
him	O
to	O
retreat	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
forced	O
him	O
into	O
a	O
passage	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Finch	O
,	O
when	O
he	O
saw	O
that	O
Turnbull	O
had	O
got	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O
key	O
,	O
he	O
being	O
upon	O
his	O
legs	O
,	O
was	O
served	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
manner	O
that	O
Mr	O
.	O
Chambers	O
was	O
before	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
shoved	O
into	O
a	O
passage	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
kept	O
.	O
When	O
Turnbull	O
had	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
coast	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
nobody	O
to	O
have	O
offered	O
the	O
least	O
sort	O
of	O
impediment	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
chest	O
and	O
took	O
away	O
different	O
bags	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
one	O
bag	O
out	O
of	O
this	O
place	O
before	O
Mr.	O
Finch	O
had	O
followed	O
Mr	O
.	O
Chambers	O
;	O
then	O
he	O
took	O
other	O
bags	O
away	O
,	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
amount	O
,	O
pretty	O
nearly	O
,	O
of	O
2308	O
guineas	O
.	O
Here	O
then	O
,	O
the	O
offence	O
seems	O
complete	O
.	O
And	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
is	O
now	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
little	O
more	O
to	O
enquire	O
of	O
,	O
than	O
the	O
evidence	O
relating	O
to	O
these	O
facts	O
.	O
Here	O
then	O
the	O
matter	O
will	O
first	O
of	O
all	O
require	O
the	O
consideration	O
of	O
the	O
learned	O
Judge	O
.	O
I	O
apprehend	O
that	O
no	O
difficulty	O
can	O
,	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
,	O
rise	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
speedy	O
determination	O
.	O
A	O
robbery	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
is	O
called	O
in	O
law	O
,	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
taking	O
from	O
the	O
person	O
of	O
another	O
,	O
by	O
putting	O
him	O
in	O
fear	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
very	O
well	O
know	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
many	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
a	O
thing	O
is	O
not	O
immediately	O
limited	O
to	O
any	O
definite	O
space	O
,	O
but	O
may	O
,	O
by	O
construction	O
,	O
be	O
carried	O
farther	O
or	O
nearer	O
;	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
with	O
regard	O
to	O
personal	O
possession	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
not	O
confined	O
to	O
the	O
actual	O
limit	O
of	O
the	O
body	O
,	O
but	O
is	O
co-extensive	O
with	O
the	O
person	O
's	O
presence	O
of	O
the	O
man	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
putting	O
a	O
personin	O
fear	O
,	O
and	O
taking	O
from	O
him	O
that	O
which	O
is	O
his	O
property	O
,	O
and	O
which	O
he	O
has	O
the	O
possession	O
of	O
in	O
his	O
sight	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
his	O
presence	O
,	O
is	O
certainly	O
a	O
taking	O
from	O
his	O
person	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
will	O
constitute	O
a	O
robbery	O
.	O
Why	O
then	O
,	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
crime	O
itself	O
in	O
the	O
outset	O
,	O
merely	O
going	O
upon	O
these	O
facts	O
,	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
complete	O
