the	O

that	O
this	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
by	O

by	O
a	O
brace	O
of	O

You	O
will	O
all	O
agree	O
with	O
me	O

that	O

it	O
was	O

enough	O

her	O

he	O
was	O

another	O

that	O
this	O

that	O
you	O

conclude	O
that	O
the	O
second	O
instrument	O

his	O

if	O
that	O

the	O

,	O
it	O
constitutes	O
no	O
apology	O
;	O
it	O
affords	O
no	O
excuse	O
;	O
it	O
amounts	O
to	O
no	O
justification	O
;	O
because	O
if	O
a	O

is	O
desperate	O
enough	O
to	O
attack	O

him	O

I	O

considerable	O
part	O

the	O

it	O
looks	O

I	O
have	O
now	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
all	O
the	O
facts	O
that	O
belong	O
to	O
the	O
case	O

I	O
mean	O
to	O
the	O

commission	O
of	O
it	O

there	O
are	O
others	O
which	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
extremely	O
important	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
lend	O
your	O
attention	O
to	O
:	O
and	O
,	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
understand	O
the	O
defence	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
in	O
his	O
perfect	O
senses	O
.	O
I	O
know	O
of	O
no	O
defence	O
that	O
calls	O
so	O
much	O
on	O
a	O
Jury	O
for	O
calm	O
and	O
deliberate	O
attention	O
;	O
because	O
there	O
is	O
none	O
which	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
well	O
made	O
out	O
,	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
effectual	O
;	O
for	O
the	O
humane	O
principle	O
of	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
England	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
man	O
shall	O
be	O
accountable	O
for	O
his	O
actions	O
,	O
who	O
is	O
under	O
the	O
visitation	O
of	O
Heaven	O
,	O
by	O
a	O
malady	O
which	O
renders	O
him	O
unknowing	O
what	O
he	O
does	O
,	O
unconscious	O
of	O
the	O
mischief	O
he	O
commits	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
amenable	O
to	O
any	O
Court	O
of	O
human	O
judicature	O
;	O
but	O
such	O
a	O
defence	O
ought	O
to	O
be	O
made	O
out	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
way	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
Jury	O
shall	O
,	O
without	O
pause	O
,	O
without	O
hesitation	O
,	O
be	O
convinced	O
of	O
it	O
;	O
for	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
defence	O
easily	O
made	O
,	O
and	O
easily	O
collected	O
from	O
the	O
fact	O
itself	O
,	O
and	O
dangerous	O
in	O
the	O
extreme	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
admitted	O
with	O
great	O
caution	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
wish	O
to	O
guide	O
your	O
attention	O
to	O
this	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
fit	O
that	O
every	O
Jury	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
guarded	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
not	O
conclude	O
that	O
,	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
fact	O
,	O
in	O
its	O
own	O
nature	O
atrocious	O
and	O
beyond	O
example	O
,	O
therefore	O
the	O
man	O
who	O
committed	O
it	O
is	O
undoubtedly	O
insane	O
.	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
I	O
intreat	O
you	O
to	O
seek	O
for	O
clear	O
and	O
unequivocal	O
proofs	O
of	O
insanity	O
;	O
if	O
you	O
find	O
them	O
,	O
in	O
God	O
's	O
name	O
let	O
him	O
be	O
acquitted	O
;	O
God	O
forbid	O
he	O
should	O
be	O
condemned	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
find	O
out	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
his	O
sober	O
senses	O
;	O
for	O
by	O
the	O
law	O
of	O
England	O
,	O
insanity	O
is	O
a	O
sufficient	O
excuse	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
is	O
under	O
the	O
operation	O
of	O
it	O
:	O
On	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
although	O
you	O
know	O
infants	O
are	O
not	O
amenable	O
to	O
the	O
law	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
yet	O
there	O
are	O
cases	O
where	O
an	O
infant	O
has	O
had	O
a	O
found	O
discretion	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
a	O
mischievous	O
intention	O
;	O
and	O
an	O
infant	O
of	O
very	O
tender	O
years	O
has	O
been	O
executed	O
:	O
just	O
so	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
lunatics	O

if	O
they	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
state	O
of	O

not	O
having	O
a	O

I	O
say	O
again	O
,	O
God	O
forbid	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
condemned	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
the	O
Jury	O
find	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
malicious	O
discretion	O
;	O
that	O
they	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
are	O
about	O

that	O
they	O
plan	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
deliberation	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
in	O
his	O
sober	O
senses	O
,	O
then	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
atrociousness	O
of	O
the	O
act	O

to	O
infer	O
that	O
the	O
criminal	O
is	O
a	O
lunatic	O
:	O
let	O
us	O
therefore	O
,	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
look	O
at	O
the	O
facts	O
of	O
this	O
case	O

and	O
see	O
whether	O
they	O
are	O
those	O
that	O

I	O
am	O
not	O

attentive	O
to	O
it	O
I	O

I	O
shall	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
prove	O
as	O
attentive	O
as	O
most	O
men	O
have	O
been	O
:	O
I	O
shall	O
prove	O
to	O
you	O
that	O
this	O

a	O
madman	O
influenced	O
by	O
the	O
moon	O

or	O
any	O

that	O
it	O
has	O

the	O
result	O
of	O
a	O
long	O

intention	O
;	O
that	O
it	O

when	O
I	O
first	O
knew	O

this	O

that	O

no	O
longer	O

appeared	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
essential	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
public	O
justice	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
other	O
hands	O

in	O
consequence	O
of	O
my	O

it	O
is	O
enough	O
for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O
to	O
day	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
state	O
the	O
fact	O

it	O
must	O
be	O
enquired	O
into	O
in	O
another	O
place	O

the	O
fact	O
is	O
,	O
those	O
pistols	O

not	O
forth-coming	O

Why	O
not	O
?	O
Why	O
Mr.	O

on	O
what	O

what	O

can	O

to	O
the	O

for	O
himself	O

not	O
for	O

have	O
stated	O
the	O
apology	O
of	O
the	O

at	O

that	O
if	O

so	O
to	O

it	O
is	O
to	O
be	O
lamented	O

it	O

any	O

Now	O
we	O
must	O
first	O

to	O
him	O

do	O
not	O

I	O
can	O
not	O

to	O
tell	O
the	O
truth	O

only	O
the	O
