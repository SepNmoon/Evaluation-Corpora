I	O
could	O
see	O
his	O

extremely	O
plain	O
by	O
the	O

of	O

We	O
fired	O
two	O
pistols	O
immediately	O
upon	O
him	O
from	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
knocked	O

off	O

as	O

were	O
not	O

there	O
was	O

I	O
asked	O
the	O

a	O

:	O
he	O
did	O
,	O
with	O
a	O

of	O

in	O
it	O

I	O
asked	O
the	O
post-boy	O
if	O
his	O

lay	O
right	O
;	O
he	O
answered	O
,	O
it	O
does	O
lay	O
very	O
right	O

I	O
thought	O
we	O
had	O
killed	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

not	O
to	O

him	O
lay	O
in	O
the	O

to	O
carry	O
him	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

him	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
assist	O

found	O

had	O
got	O
a	O
pistol	O
in	O
the	O
lining	O
of	O

it	O
out	O

by	O

what	O

that	O
we	O
were	O
stopped	O

I	O
had	O
my	O
