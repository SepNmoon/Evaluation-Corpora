the	O

My	O

I	O

it	O
that	O
your	O

I	O
submit	O
that	O

distinguished	O

only	O

that	O

My	O

this	O

the	O
decision	O
in	O
Tooley	O

it	O
that	O

Gentleman	O
of	O
so	O
strange	O
a	O
nature	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
they	O
certainly	O
require	O
an	O
answer	O
.	O
The	O
learned	O
Gentleman	O
began	O
by	O
mentioning	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Sir	O
Harry	O
Ferrers	O
;	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
it	O
arose	O
on	O
a	O
warrant	O
which	O
stiled	O
him	O
Knight	O
,	O
when	O
it	O
caught	O
to	O
have	O
stiled	O
him	O
Baronet	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
they	O
had	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
take	O
up	O
the	O
person	O
whom	O
they	O
did	O
take	O
up	O
.	O
Now	O
that	O
is	O
exactly	O
what	O
I	O
contend	O
for	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
that	O
case	O
approximates	O
to	O
this	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
officers	O
had	O
no	O
right	O
to	O
take	O
Sullivan	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
demeaning	O
himself	O
peaceably	O
and	O
quietly	O
,	O
nor	O
any	O
of	O
those	O
whom	O
they	O
arrested	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
an	O
offender	O
against	O
the	O
statute	O
.	O
Again	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
cases	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
argued	O
in	O
myfavour	O
,	O
and	O
drawn	O
the	O
chain	O
tighter	O
,	O
if	O
possible	O
,	O
against	O
himself	O
.	O
He	O
says	O
,	O
the	O
persons	O
taken	O
into	O
custody	O
made	O
no	O
resistance	O
;	O
they	O
were	O
taken	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
submitted	O
as	O
they	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O
submitted	O
.	O
So	O
I	O
might	O
say	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
Hugget	O
;	O
he	O
had	O
submitted	O
,	O
but	O
said	O
,	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
justify	O
the	O
officers	O
,	O
they	O
were	O
still	O
trespassers	O
:	O
the	O
restraint	O
of	O
liberty	O
was	O
improper	O
and	O
illegal	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
was	O
held	O
to	O
be	O
manslaughter	O
only	O
.	O
The	O
same	O
observation	O
applies	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
the	O
Queen	O
and	O
Tooley	O
;	O
the	O
woman	O
was	O
in	O
custody	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
time	O
,	O
at	O
a	O
distance	O
from	O
the	O
place	O
where	O
the	O
assault	O
was	O
committed	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
prisoners	O
first	O
drew	O
their	O
swords	O
,	O
and	O
attacked	O
the	O
officer	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
heat	O
of	O
passion	O
had	O
abundant	O
time	O
to	O
subside	O
,	O
but	O
what	O
did	O
they	O
do	O
?	O
They	O
made	O
a	O
second	O
attack	O
upon	O
the	O
officers	O
,	O
and	O
drew	O
their	O
swords	O
again	O
;	O
but	O
here	O
the	O
attack	O
is	O
all	O
sudden	O
,	O
no	O
interval	O
,	O
no	O
time	O
for	O
the	O
passion	O
of	O
the	O
human	O
mind	O
to	O
subside	O
,	O
and	O
therefore	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
strong	O
a	O
case	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
the	O
accused	O
as	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
.	O
There	O
is	O

observation	O

My	O

that	O

right	O

to	O
go	O

the	O

Now	O

Gentlemen	O

upon	O
that	O
subject	O

I	O
will	O
not	O

perhaps	O
there	O
might	O

be	O
some	O
objections	O
to	O
the	O
warrant	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
,	O
if	O
a	O
man	O
is	O
taken	O
up	O
by	O
an	O

the	O
person	O

takes	O
him	O
up	O

after	O
the	O

over	O

about	O
his	O
business	O

there	O
is	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
it	O

why	O
no	O

a	O
right	O
to	O

the	O
person	O
who	O

executed	O
the	O
warrant	O

,	O
therefore	O
,	O
the	O
question	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
is	O
not	O
the	O
question	O
that	O
was	O
made	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
cases	O

have	O
heard	O

for	O
in	O
those	O

the	O

taken	O
up	O

in	O
the	O

of	O
that	O

it	O

the	O
Jury	O
,	O
upon	O
that	O

that	O
was	O

of	O

called	O
murder	O
,	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

I	O
take	O
the	O
present	O
question	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
another	O

if	O
it	O
is	O

you	O
should	O

is	O
this	O
:	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
question	O
to	O

how	O
material	O
it	O

that	O
the	O

that	O
