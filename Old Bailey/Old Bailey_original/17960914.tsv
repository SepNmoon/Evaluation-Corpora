how	O
he	O

would	O

the	O
story	O

us	O
in	O

against	O
Miss	O

justice	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
they	O
speak	O
the	O
truth	O
in	O
their	O

when	O
they	O

``	O
that	O

as	O
to	O

it	O
can	O
not	O

error	O

that	O

that	O
the	O

then	O
I	O
think	O
you	O

only	O
;	O
if	O
you	O

it	O

off	O

,	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
murder	O
of	O
an	O
atrocious	O
nature	O

are	O
a	O

observed	O
upon	O

of	O

that	O
where	O
a	O
pistol	O
does	O
go	O
off	O

,	O
it	O
is	O
natural	O
for	O
a	O

to	O
say	O

it	O

it	O
was	O
an	O
accident	O

so	O
to	O

he	O

not	O
tell	O
Mr.	O

only	O
asks	O
him	O
forgiveness	O

your	O

low	O

it	O
should	O
weight	O
in	O

that	O
this	O

down	O

unless	O
he	O
was	O
cocking	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
;	O
if	O
he	O
carried	O
it	O
down	O
cocked	O
at	O
the	O
time	O

he	O
ought	O
to	O
have	O

very	O
careful	O
not	O
to	O
have	O
put	O
that	O
pistol	O
so	O
near	O
Mr.	O

as	O
to	O
endanger	O
his	O
life	O
;	O
but	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
matter	O
perhaps	O
that	O
will	O
affect	O
the	O
degree	O
of	O
guilt	O

to	O
the	O
punishment	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
find	O
him	O
guilty	O

;	O
then	O
here	O
is	O
a	O
circumstance	O
that	O
will	O

I	O
shall	O
be	O

of	O
the	O

the	O
possession	O
of	O
the	O

;	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
proved	O
that	O

you	O

a	O
doubt	O
with	O

there	O
were	O
several	O
meetings	O

therefore	O
I	O

ask	O

upon	O
what	O
ground	O
the	O

is	O
to	O
be	O
defended	O

for	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
said	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
guilty	O
of	O
the	O
felony	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
before	O
the	O
alledgment	O
of	O
a	O

;	O
you	O

astray	O
by	O
such	O
an	O
observation	O

for	O
this	O

commenced	O
for	O
some	O

after	O
the	O
commitment	O
of	O
the	O
offence	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
tell	O
you	O
why	O
the	O
prosecutor	O
sat	O
down	O
content	O
with	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
his	O
ducks	O
,	O
while	O
he	O
was	O
protected	O
in	O
his	O
liberty	O
;	O
but	O
afterwards	O
,	O
the	O
story	O
got	O

in	O
the	O

and	O
I	O
will	O
say	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
honour	O
of	O
the	O
Magistrates	O
in	O
that	O
quarter	O
,	O
they	O
insisted	O
that	O

do	O
that	O
justice	O
to	O
the	O
public	O
which	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

demanded	O
;	O
it	O
was	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
the	O

came	O

not	O

borne	O
the	O
expence	O
of	O
a	O

these	O

I	O
shall	O
prove	O
clearly	O
beyond	O
all	O
controversy	O
;	O
and	O
,	O
I	O
say	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
find	O
him	O
guilty	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
that	O

you	O
consign	O

the	O

if	O
he	O
is	O
guilty	O

I	O
hope	O
that	O
verdict	O
will	O
be	O
held	O
up	O
as	O
a	O
mirror	O
to	O
those	O
men	O
who	O
are	O
