that	O

would	O

does	O
it	O

Gentlemen	O

really	O

when	O

you	O

it	O
not	O

to	O

that	O

that	O
an	O

I	O

I	O
hope	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
he	O

to	O

Mr.	O

who	O
would	O
represent	O
it	O
to	O
the	O

we	O
have	O

and	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
Mr.	O
Baldwin	O

Now	O
it	O
was	O
asked	O
by	O
the	O
learned	O
gentleman	O
who	O
conducts	O
this	O
prosecution	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
pressed	O
upon	O
Mr.	O

in	O

of	O
a	O

by	O
me	O
;	O
my	O

I	O
am	O

for	O
the	O

;	O
sorry	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
put	O
questions	O
that	O
the	O
prosecutor	O
takes	O
advantage	O
of	O
;	O
but	O
,	O
gentlemen	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
an	O
assertion	O
that	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
made	O
against	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
present	O
instance	O
;	O
I	O
asked	O
Mr.	O
Baldwin	O
that	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
duty	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
know	O
whether	O
this	O
man	O
had	O
made	O
any	O
other	O
application	O
than	O
that	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
now	O
stated	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
the	O
smuggling	O
one	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Baldwin	O
states	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
make	O
another	O
application	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
learned	O
friend	O
,	O
he	O
says	O
,	O
he	O
forbad	O
him	O
to	O
make	O
any	O
more	O
;	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
meant	O
to	O
be	O
inferred	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
man	O
afterwards	O
must	O
know	O
that	O
any	O
application	O
of	O
that	O
sort	O
must	O
sail	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
he	O
had	O
taken	O
the	O
money	O
,	O
knowing	O
it	O
must	O
fail	O
.	O
Now	O
,	O
is	O
that	O
a	O
fair	O
argument	O
to	O
be	O
used	O
against	O
a	O
prisoner	O
standing	O
in	O
the	O
perilous	O
situation	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
stands	O
;	O
there	O
was	O
an	O
application	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Baldwin	O
thinks	O
,	O
in	O

of	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Hill	O
;	O
certainly	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
,	O
and	O
Mrs.	O
Hill	O
has	O
indicted	O
the	O
defendant	O
for	O
a	O
similar	O
offence	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
that	O
will	O
by	O
and	O
by	O
come	O
before	O
you	O
.	O
Well	O
there	O
,	O
Mr.	O
Baldwin	O
,	O
said	O
he	O
,	O
forbad	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
but	O
when	O
Saunders	O
was	O
in	O
Newgate	O
,	O
does	O
it	O
follow	O
,	O
that	O
because	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
forbad	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
any	O
more	O
,	O
that	O
through	O
any	O
other	O
channel	O
,	O
he	O
might	O
not	O
succeed	O
in	O
getting	O
himself	O
introduced	O
to	O
persons	O
in	O
confidence	O
with	O
his	O
Majesty	O
,	O
who	O
might	O

with	O
his	O
ministers	O

consider	O
whether	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
fit	O
case	O
for	O
mercy	O
or	O
not	O
;	O
therefore	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
last	O
observation	O
of	O
my	O

will	O
not	O
have	O
the	O

to	O
what	O

does	O
it	O

Gentlemen	O
,	O
it	O
does	O
seem	O

as	O
I	O
stated	O
in	O

that	O
this	O

a	O

of	O
very	O

now	O

the	O
very	O
eloquent	O

powerful	O
opponent	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
upon	O
the	O
present	O
occasion	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
been	O
brought	O
down	O
here	O
to	O
address	O
you	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
importance	O
to	O
the	O
defendant	O
,	O
what	O
verdict	O
you	O
shall	O
hereafter	O
give	O
;	O
for	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
statute	O
upon	O
which	O
this	O
indctment	O
is	O
framed	O
,	O
you	O
will	O
learn	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O

is	O
liable	O
to	O
be	O
transported	O
for	O
the	O

Therefore	O
,	O
gentlemen	O

bearing	O
that	O
in	O
your	O

you	O
will	O
weigh	O
these	O
circumstances	O

and	O
weight	O
them	O
with	O
great	O
caution	O
before	O
you	O

that	O
the	O
intent	O
of	O
the	O

was	O
to	O

will	O
certainly	O
be	O
the	O
occasion	O
of	O
his	O

if	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
good	O
fortune	O
to	O
make	O
myself	O
understood	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
offence	O
attributable	O
to	O
the	O
prisoner	O
stands	O
;	O
upon	O
these	O

observations	O
;	O
and	O
when	O
I	O
have	O
made	O
those	O

I	O
shall	O
leave	O
him	O
to	O
that	O
justice	O

just	O
now	O
,	O
no	O
one	O
person	O
with	O
any	O
abuse	O

at	O
all	O

perhaps	O
the	O

the	O

you	O

that	O
in	O

there	O
were	O
persons	O

very	O
inferior	O
indeed	O
,	O
who	O
might	O
make	O
false	O
representations	O
to	O
the	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
person	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Noble	O
;	O
who	O
he	O
is	O
I	O

I	O
have	O
read	O
in	O
the	O
papers	O
of	O
a	O
Mr.	O
Noble	O
having	O
been	O
examined	O
;	O
but	O
I	O
believe	O
the	O
situation	O
of	O
Noble	O
was	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
of	O
an	O
inferior	O
servant	O
or	O

in	O
the	O

also	O
another	O

;	O
what	O
influence	O
they	O
may	O
have	O
I	O
certainly	O
can	O
not	O
state	O
;	O
but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
sufficient	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
prisoner	O
supposed	O
that	O
,	O
by	O
the	O
influence	O
of	O
the	O
servants	O
of	O
a	O
great	O
man	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
probably	O
meet	O
with	O
success	O
in	O
the	O
application	O
which	O
he	O
fought	O
for	O

Now	O
it	O
seems	O
from	O
this	O
statement	O
to	O
me	O

that	O
he	O
made	O
application	O
to	O
Noble	O
;	O
what	O
Noble	O
did	O
upon	O
it	O
I	O
can	O
not	O

to	O
you	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
here	O
to	O

certainly	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
examined	O
upon	O
the	O
subject	O

upon	O

quite	O
sufficient	O
for	O

from	O

the	O

parts	O

the	O
most	O
valuable	O

thing	O

that	O
