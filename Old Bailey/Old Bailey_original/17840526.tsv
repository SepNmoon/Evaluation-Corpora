that	O

that	O

out	O

for	O
the	O
purpose	O
of	O

might	O

that	O
as	O

the	O

two	O

Mr.	O

.	O
It	O
is	O
sufficient	O
,	O
I	O
submit	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
argue	O
also	O
from	O
the	O
presumption	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
not	O
come	O
.	O
Has	O
he	O
desired	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
in	O
a	O
post-chaise	O
?	O
Has	O
he	O
told	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
pay	O
his	O
expences	O
?	O
I	O
say	O
then	O
the	O
suggestion	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
by	O
possibility	O
he	O
may	O
come	O
;	O
I	O
say	O
the	O
presumption	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
not	O
;	O
and	O
in	O
such	O
a	O
case	O
as	O
this	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
lose	O
only	O
six	O
witnesses	O
,	O
what	O
may	O
be	O
the	O
consequence	O
?	O
Will	O
your	O
Lordship	O
be	O
measuring	O
with	O
compasses	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
evidence	O
?	O
-	O
It	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
.	O
It	O
is	O
impossible	O
that	O
any	O
man	O
who	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
these	O
kind	O
of	O
prosecutions	O
,	O
but	O
must	O
know	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
loosest	O
evidence	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
give	O
,	O
that	O
relates	O
to	O
the	O
charge	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
a	O
circumstance	O
in	O
the	O
scale	O
of	O
justice	O
that	O
may	O
save	O
my	O
client	O
's	O
life	O
;	O
and	O
you	O
must	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
extremely	O
likely	O
we	O
may	O
lose	O
many	O
witnesses	O
.	O
My	O
answer	O
therefore	O
to	O
the	O
affidavit	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
upon	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
it	O
appears	O
there	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
due	O
legal	O
diligence	O
;	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
many	O
neglects	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
does	O
not	O
appear	O
that	O
the	O
witnesses	O
will	O
come	O
;	O
and	O
the	O
presumption	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
not	O
:	O
and	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
trial	O
off	O
,	O
would	O
be	O
doing	O
great	O
injustice	O
to	O
my	O
client	O
;	O
nor	O
does	O
it	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
fact	O
they	O
propose	O
to	O
prove	O
by	O
this	O
witness	O
,	O
may	O
be	O
proved	O
by	O
the	O
others	O
:	O
under	O
these	O
circumstances	O
,	O
my	O
Lord	O
,	O
I	O
hope	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
prisoner	O
at	O
the	O
bar	O
,	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
not	O
put	O
off	O
this	O
trial	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Lee	O
.	O
I	O
must	O
trouble	O
your	O
Lordship	O
with	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
beg	O
to	O
observe	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
observations	O
which	O
have	O
been	O
offered	O
,	O
appear	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
substantial	O
and	O
unanswerable	O
.	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
help	O
thinking	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
such	O
an	O
application	O
as	O
never	O
was	O
made	O
to	O
a	O
Court	O
of	O
Justice	O
under	O
the	O
like	O
circumstances	O
:	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
who	O
makes	O
the	O
affidavit	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
impose	O
on	O
the	O
Court	O
in	O
it	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
persuaded	O
that	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
is	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
honour	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
character	O
most	O
certainly	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
says	O
he	O
takes	O
this	O
man	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
material	O
witness	O
;	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
as	O
intimate	O
that	O
he	O
ever	O
saw	O
the	O
man	O
in	O
his	O
life	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
ever	O
conversed	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
ever	O
corresponded	O
with	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
ever	O
made	O
enquiry	O
about	O
him	O
until	O
last	O
Monday	O
;	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
fact	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
can	O
be	O
collected	O
from	O
the	O
affidavit	O
:	O
but	O
on	O
Monday	O
last	O
,	O
by	O
what	O
illuminations	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
has	O
not	O
condescended	O
to	O
explain	O
,	O
it	O
comes	O
into	O
his	O
head	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
that	O
lives	O
at	O
Chiswick	O
of	O
the	O
name	O
of	O
Parr	O
,	O
may	O
of	O
must	O
know	O
something	O
of	O
the	O
matter	O
vastly	O
important	O
;	O
for	O
what	O
reason	O
does	O
he	O
think	O
so	O
?	O
Now	O
is	O
there	O
any	O
reason	O
upon	O
earth	O
,	O
except	O
this	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
of	O
the	O
Superbe	O
!	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
pretty	O
singular	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
take	O
upon	O
himself	O
to	O
say	O
so	O
,	O
without	O
having	O
any	O
conversation	O
with	O
him	O
.	O
Material	O
,	O
why	O
?	O
Why	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
is	O
the	O
Lieutenant	O
;	O
and	O
this	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
the	O
Captain	O
of	O
the	O

ship	O
and	O
the	O
Mate	O
are	O
at	O
the	O
back	O

the	O
Master	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
at	O
the	O
back	O
of	O

without	O
an	O
intimation	O
that	O
this	O
man	O
either	O
did	O

could	O
know	O
any	O
thing	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
that	O
they	O
did	O
not	O
or	O
must	O
not	O
know	O
:	O
but	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
says	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
in	O
point	O
of	O
candour	O
how	O
this	O
man	O
's	O
evidence	O
is	O
material	O
,	O
I	O
mean	O
to	O
prove	O
that	O
the	O
goods	O
were	O
not	O
delivered	O
to	O
Lieutenant	O
Colonel	O
Rooke	B-pers
,	O
which	O
were	O
supposed	O
by	O
these	O
papers	O
to	O
be	O
delivered	O
to	O
him	O
.	O
Why	O
,	O
now	O
would	O
you	O
believe	O
,	O
my	O
Lord	O
,	O
that	O
this	O
very	O
Colonel	O
Rooke	B-pers
is	O
the	O
tenth	O
witness	O
on	O
this	O
very	O
bill	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
attending	O
in	O
Court	O

If	O
the	O
fact	O
is	O
false	O
that	O
there	O
never	O
was	O
any	O
goods	O
delivered	O
to	O
Colonel	O
Rooke	B-pers

can	O
not	O
he	O

it	O

does	O
Mr.	O

mean	O

,	O
that	O
Colonel	O
Rooke	B-pers

supposed	O
defect	O
in	O

to	O

bolstered	O
up	O
by	O
the	O
assistance	O
of	O
this	O
unknown	O
gentleman	O
at	O
Chiswick	O
!	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
does	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
say	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
thinks	O
Colonel	O

will	O
not	O

this	O
Lieutenant	O
of	O

him	O

There	O
is	O
no	O
colour	O

pretence	O
in	O
my	O
apprehension	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
the	O
Gentleman	O
can	O
be	O
material	O

and	O
they	O
can	O
not	O
pretend	O
to	O
insinuate	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
.	O
My	O
Lord	O
,	O
I	O
beg	O
leave	O
to	O
say	O

that	O
to	O
put	O
off	O
a	O
trial	O
on	O
the	O
absence	O

it	O

all	O
the	O

blame	O

is	O
perfectly	O
unusual	O

my	O

I	O
say	O
it	O
would	O

great	O
blame	O
in	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
were	O

that	O
I	O

fully	O

would	O
turn	O

it	O

is	O

twenty	O

without	O

him	O

I	O
will	O

my	O

that	O
in	O

to	O
your	O

that	O
there	O
is	O

notorious	O
clear	O
defect	O
of	O

more	O
than	O
that	O

there	O
is	O
a	O

immediately	O
upon	O

you	O

the	O
most	O

I	O

it	O
was	O
the	O
duty	O

Mr.	O
Baxter	O

the	O

we	O

we	O
have	O
not	O
got	O
a	O
witness	O
from	O
Tamworth	O
!	O
Now	O
the	O
attorney	O
may	O
think	O

that	O
it	O
may	O

two	O

Mr	O

My	O

,	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
the	O
principles	O

in	O
the	O

that	O
there	O
must	O

all	O

;	O
in	O
the	O

that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
high	O
probability	O
that	O
the	O

will	O
attend	O
;	O
the	O
application	O

is	O
the	O
true	O
question	O
between	O
us	O
:	O
and	O
first	O
,	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
witness	O
's	O
materiality	O
;	O
I	O
suppose	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
man	O
living	O
that	O
does	O
not	O
know	O
,	O
that	O
a	O
Lieutenant	O

is	O
of	O
much	O
importance	O
on	O
board	O
the	O

;	O
much	O
of	O
the	O
detail	O
belongs	O
to	O
him	O
more	O
than	O
to	O
the	O
Captain	O
;	O
and	O
likewise	O
if	O
there	O
were	O
three	O
or	O
four	O
witnesses	O
it	O
is	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
possible	O
that	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
absent	O
on	O
important	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
therefore	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
the	O
whole	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
,	O
we	O
must	O
get	O
such	O
separate	O
witnesses	O
as	O
were	O
present	O
in	O
any	O
local	O
station	O
:	O
if	O
it	O
should	O
so	O
turn	O
out	O
,	O
that	O
these	O

who	O
are	O
present	O
were	O
not	O
on	O

observes	O
too	O
,	O
that	O
Colonel	O

can	O
prove	O
all	O
this	O
:	O
now	O
we	O
conceive	O
it	O
important	O
for	O
us	O
to	O
prove	O
,	O
that	O
no	O
such	O
provisions	O
ever	O
did	O
go	O
on	O

as	O

to	O

that	O

with	O

this	O

in	O
the	O

to	O

in	O
the	O

we	O
had	O
no	O

of	O
his	O
being	O
to	O
be	O
found	O
at	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
warning	O
,	O
but	O
he	O
went	O
suddenly	O
into	O
Warwickshire	O
:	O
to	O
be	O
sure	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
case	O
of	O
gentlemen	O
of	O
his	O
rank	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
usual	O
to	O

allowance	O
of	O

;	O
he	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
in	O
want	O
of	O
a	O
little	O
money	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
prevent	O
his	O
walking	O
up	O
,	O
my	O
learned	O
friend	O
says	O
;	O
now	O
it	O
could	O
hardly	O
occur	O
to	O
any	O
man	O
of	O
business	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O

it	O
would	O
as	O
hardly	O
enter	O
into	O
the	O

of	O

to	O
all	O
the	O

they	O
were	O
used	O
on	O
this	O

such	O

on	O

out	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
material	O
witness	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
believe	O

requires	O
a	O

of	O
sagacity	O

much	O
less	O
of	O
inspiration	O
,	O
to	O
suppose	O
that	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
very	O
essential	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
this	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
being	O
resident	O
in	O
town	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
not	O
the	O
smallest	O
doubt	O
of	O
finding	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
was	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
persuaded	O
he	O
should	O
find	O
him	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
been	O
at	O
his	O
house	O
to	O

,	O
and	O
left	O
a	O
message	O
to	O
conduct	O
him	O
here	O
if	O
he	O
should	O
come	O
;	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
doubt	O
but	O
Lieutenant	O
Parr	B-pers
being	O
a	O
gentleman	O
,	O
and	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
reputation	O
and	O
character	O
,	O
if	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
mean	O
to	O
attend	O
,	O
would	O
have	O
suggested	O
some	O
reason	O
why	O
;	O
the	O
probability	O
is	O
therefore	O
by	O
his	O
silence	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
means	O
to	O
come	O
:	O
and	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
gross	O
neglect	O
in	O
a	O
case	O
where	O
no	O
further	O
delay	O
is	O
desired	O
than	O
till	O
Monday	O
morning	O
,	O
what	O
harm	O
can	O
arise	O
?	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
,	O
from	O
the	O
respectable	O
appearance	O
of	O
those	O
Noblemen	O
that	O
attend	O
for	O
the	O
prisoner	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
attend	O
on	O
Monday	O
;	O
and	O
there	O
are	O
none	O
of	O
them	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
are	O
likely	O
to	O
perish	O
between	O
this	O
and	O
Monday	O
,	O
God	O
forbid	O
they	O
should	O
!	O
I	O
conceive	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
my	O
Lord	O
,	O
that	O
Mr.	O
Baxter	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
has	O
done	O
what	O
any	O

would	O
have	O
done	O
,	O
respecting	O
a	O
man	O
who	O
lived	O
at	O

and	O
with	O
respect	O
to	O
the	O
materiality	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
think	O
no	O
man	O
can	O

that	O
in	O
the	O

it	O
is	O
necessary	O

every	O
person	O
we	O
can	O
.	O
Mr.	O
Bearcroft	O
and	O
Mr.	O
Lee	O
very	O
properly	O
object	O

this	O
motion	O
on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

and	O
God	O
forbid	O
that	O
any	O

I	O
hope	O
Mr.	O

will	O
give	O
us	O
credit	O

to	O

in	O

it	O

that	O

Mr.	O

to	O
Lieutenant	O

he	O
waited	O
on	O
him	O

better	O
to	O

he	O
might	O

it	O

would	O

refuse	O

assent	O
to	O
putting	O
off	O
this	O

;	O
the	O
ground	O
of	O
my	O
refusal	O
is	O
the	O
uncertainty	O
,	O
or	O
rather	O
the	O
improbability	O
of	O
his	O
being	O
here	O
on	O
Monday	O
;	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
loose	O
answer	O
,	O
he	O
understood	O
from	O
a	O
servant	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
gone	O
to	O
Tamworth	O
;	O
he	O
immediately	O
writes	O
down	O
to	O
Tamworth	O
,	O
desiring	O
Mr.	O
Parr	O
to	O
come	O
to	O

immediately	O
,	O
had	O
he	O
been	O
at	O

what	O
would	O
he	O
have	O
done	O
as	O
a	O
gentleman	O
when	O
he	O
received	O
that	O
letter	O
on	O
Wednesday	O

he	O
certainly	O
would	O
have	O
either	O
wrote	O
by	O

that	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
come	O
,	O
or	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
set	O
out	O

have	O
set	O
out	O
directly	O

then	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
here	O
now	O

the	O
probability	O
therefore	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
not	O
at	O
Tamworth	O
,	O
for	O
as	O
an	O
officer	O
of	O

guilty	O
of	O
any	O
such	O
neglect	O
,	O
as	O
not	O

an	O
answer	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
he	O
never	O

this	O

the	O
foundation	O
for	O
supposing	O
him	O
to	O
be	O
there	O

is	O
nothing	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
vague	O
loose	O
discourse	O
with	O
a	O

who	O
understood	O
that	O
his	O

now	O
if	O
he	O

to	O
me	O
to	O
be	O
