that	O

that	O
is	O
necessarily	O

in	O
the	O
charge	O
itself	O

of	O
endeavouring	O
;	O
but	O
a	O
full	O
and	O
satisfactory	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
Judges	O
,	O
is	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
word	O

in	O

will	O
be	O
found	O
a	O
sufficient	O

this	O
objection	O

that	O
the	O
charge	O
might	O
have	O
been	O
branched	O
into	O
several	O
