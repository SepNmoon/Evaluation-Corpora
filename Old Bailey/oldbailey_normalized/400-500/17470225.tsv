hollowing	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
bold	O

with	O
something	O
in	O
his	O

when	O
he	O
came	O
near	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Pistol	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
drunken	O
Gentleman	O
,	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
Appearance	O
of	O
a	O

I	O

wanted	O
the	O

I	O
crossed	O
my	O
Horse	O
out	O

not	O

I	O

he	O
turned	O
his	O

that	O
he	O

he	O
presented	O
a	O

at	O
me	O

I	O
judged	O
it	O
was	O
rather	O
longer	O
than	O
a	O

he	O

demanded	O
my	O

I	O
had	O

18	O
Years	O

nothing	O

that	O

it	O
