is,0
the,0
evidence,0
on,0
the,0
part,0
of,0
the,0
prosecution,0

The,0
prisoner,0
has,0
admitted,0
that,0
he,0
met,0
Lord,0
Fielding,0
twice,0
",",0
but,0
he,0
says,0
that,0
when,0
he,0
met,0
him,0
he,0
did,0
not,0
charge,0
Lord,0
Fielding,0
with,0
any,0
crime,0
or,0
any,0
attempt,0
to,0
commit,0
a,0
crime,0

that,0
he,0
only,0
said,0
to,0

He,0
wanted,0
to,0
tell,0
him,0
something,0
about,0

and,0
that,0
Lord,0

made,0

Mr.,0
Charles,B-pers
Fielding,I-pers

he,0
further,0
adds,0
",",0
had,0
the,0
words,0
put,0
into,0

and,0
could,0
make,0
no,0

at,0

The,0
defence,0
by,0
the,0
prisoner,0
made,0
it,0
incumbent,0
upon,0
me,0
to,0
ask,0
Lord,0
Fielding,0
and,0
Mr,0

Fielding,0
",",0
whether,0
any,0
such,0
thing,0
did,0
pass,0

or,0
if,0
there,0
was,0
any,0
truth,0
in,0
what,0
this,0
suggested,0
by,0
the,0
prisoner,0
;,0
they,0
both,0
denied,0
it,0
.,0
This,0
is,0
all,0
the,0
evidence,0
that,0
has,0
been,0
given,0
to,0
you,0
;,0
you,0
will,0
consider,0
it,0
in,0
the,0
two,0
lights,0
I,0
have,0
mentioned,0
.,0
Whether,0
you,0
are,0
satisfied,0
there,0
was,0
an,0
actual,0
force,0
and,0
violence,0
and,0
a,0
restraint,0
upon,0
the,0
mind,0
of,0
Mr,0
.,0
Fielding,0
",",0
that,0
rests,0
upon,0
his,0
evidence,0
",",0
for,0
nobody,0
could,0
be,0
present,0
but,0
himself,0
",",0
he,0
had,0
given,0
the,0
prisoner,0
a,0
half,0
guinea,0
",",0
this,0
was,0
all,0
the,0
money,0
he,0
had,0
",",0
and,0
the,0
prisoner,0
was,0
not,0
contented,0
with,0
that,0
",",0
he,0
tells,0
him,0
it,0
was,0
not,0
sufficient,0
",",0
so,0
it,0
was,0
a,0
demand,0
of,0
more,0
",",0
if,0
Mr,0
.,0
Fielding,0
had,0
more,0
that,0
he,0
could,0
have,0
given,0
him,0
;,0
and,0
to,0
be,0
sure,0
there,0
is,0
something,0
very,0
singular,0
in,0
the,0
last,0
meeting,0
when,0
Mr,0
.,0
Fielding,0
went,0
to,0
Mr,0
.,0
Waters,0
's,0
and,0
not,0
to,0
be,0
accounted,0
for,0
but,0
from,0
fear,0
and,0
terror,0
in,0
his,0
mind,0
:,0
though,0
he,0
sees,0
this,0
prisoner,0
in,0
the,0
street,0
",",0
and,0
though,0
he,0
goes,0
with,0
him,0
to,0
the,0
middle,0
of,0
Bond-street,0
",",0
he,0
knows,0
so,0
little,0
what,0
he,0
is,0
about,0
",",0
that,0
he,0
goes,0
into,0
the,0
grocer,0
's,0
shop,0
.,0
He,0
gives,0
a,0
guinea,0
to,0
the,0
grocer,0
to,0
give,0
the,0
prisoner,0
.,0
He,0
did,0
not,0
go,0
there,0
to,0
borrow,0
it,0
",",0
for,0
he,0
had,0
it,0
in,0
his,0
pocket,0
",",0
for,0
what,0
purpose,0
unless,0
through,0
fear,0

and,0
not,0
being,0
master,0
of,0
himself,0
",",0
could,0
he,0
go,0
into,0
the,0
shop,0
?,0
The,0
circumstance,0
is,0
very,0
strong,0
to,0
show,0
he,0
was,0
not,0
master,0
of,0
his,0
own,0
mind,0
",",0
but,0
acted,0
through,0
violence,0
and,0
compulsion,0

to,0

did,0
apprehend,0

at,0
that,0
time,0

the,0
charge,0
would,0
cost,0
him,0
his,0
life,0

If,0
you,0
believe,0
that,0
evidence,0
",",0
then,0
it,0
seems,0
very,0
clear,0
",",0
that,0
Mr,0
.,0
Fielding,0
acted,0
under,0
the,0
immediate,0
fear,0
and,0
terror,0

not,0
only,0
of,0
a,0
criminal,0
punishment,0

his,0
life,0

in,0

but,0
",",0
if,0
you,0
should,0
not,0
be,0
satisfied,0
of,0
that,0
",",0
it,0
is,0
not,0
necessary,0
in,0
many,0
cases,0
",",0
that,0
the,0
persons,0
robbed,0
should,0
apprehend,0
themselves,0
in,0
immediate,0

The,0
case,0
has,0

a,0
soldier,0

has,0
been,0
attacked,0

I,0
remember,0
one,0
where,0
the,0
gentleman,0

had,0
been,0

said,0

had,0
no,0
fear,0

and,0
that,0
has,0
been,0
received,0
as,0
the,0
law,0
ever,0
since,0

that,0
if,0
such,0
circumstances,0
are,0
made,0
use,0

as,0
would,0
impose,0
a,0
terror,0

violence,0

a,0
reasonable,0
mind,0

the,0
individual,0

be,0
so,0
confident,0

to,0
apprehend,0
danger,0
