will,0
hear,0

you,0
are,0
possessed,0
of,0

and,0
therefore,0
can,0
with,0
more,0
correctness,0
apply,0
it,0

it,0
is,0
however,0
my,0
duty,0
just,0
to,0
observe,0

that,0
it,0
is,0
not,0
necessary,0
to,0
constitute,0
the,0
crime,0
of,0
murder,0
that,0
there,0
should,0
be,0
a,0
malignity,0
directed,0
against,0
an,0
individual,0

if,0
a,0
man,0
commits,0
an,0
act,0
from,0
which,0
death,0
may,0
ensue,0

which,0
from,0
the,0
nature,0
of,0
it,0
marks,0
a,0
wanton,0
disregard,0
of,0

safety,0
of,0

that,0
is,0
equally,0
immoral,0

the,0
public,0
safety,0
requires,0

should,0
be,0
classed,0
in,0
an,0
equal,0
degree,0
of,0
guilt,0
with,0
the,0
premeditated,0
destruction,0
of,0
an,0
individual,0
;,0
I,0
fear,0
it,0
will,0
be,0
difficult,0
for,0
the,0
prisoner,0
to,0
extenuate,0
this,0
case,0

some,0
