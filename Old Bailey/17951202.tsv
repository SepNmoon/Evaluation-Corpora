what,0
is,0
the,0
case,0
with,0

proved,0
?,0

takes,0
the,0

takes,0

divested,0

is,0
contended,0

that,0
that,0
is,0
a,0
separation,0
of,0

premisses,0

I,0
can,0
not,0
agree,0
in,0
that,0
;,0
I,0
consider,0
it,0
as,0
not,0
being,0
out,0
of,0
his,0
occupation,0

he,0
resides,0
there,0
himself,0

The,0
next,0
question,0
is,0

whether,0

to,0

us,0
see,0
whether,0
the,0
servants,0
of,0
the,0
partnership,0
are,0
confined,0
to,0
this,0
office,0

so,0
far,0

one,0

That,0
does,0
away,0
the,0
separation,0

I,0
am,0
of,0
opinion,0
it,0
is,0
to,0
be,0
considered,0
as,0
the,0
dwelling-house,0
of,0
Mr.,0
Welch,0
",",0
because,0
neither,0
of,0
the,0
partners,0
are,0
bound,0
to,0
pay,0
rent,0
nor,0
taxes,0
;,0
and,0
to,0
consider,0
them,0
as,0
occupiers,0
of,0
this,0
house,0

it,0
is,0
necessary,0
not,0
only,0
that,0
they,0
should,0
have,0
a,0
servant,0
sleep,0
in,0
the,0
house,0

that,0
they,0

and,0
therefore,0
it,0
is,0
in,0
the,0
sole,0

If,0
it,0
were,0
a,0
fact,0
that,0
