The,0
only,0
question,0
is,0

whether,0
these,0
five,0
men,0
have,0
offended,0
the,0
law,0
in,0
the,0
way,0
that,0
I,0
have,0
stated,0

namely,0
",",0
that,0
they,0
have,0
conspired,0
to,0
injure,0
and,0
obstruct,0
the,0
trade,0
of,0
their,0
masters,0

I,0
must,0
say,0

the,0
evidence,0
does,0
not,0
prove,0

I,0
think,0
the,0
evidence,0
does,0
prove,0
the,0
general,0
Count,0
;,0
and,0
if,0
that,0
is,0
made,0
out,0
to,0
your,0
satisfaction,0

it,0
will,0
be,0
an,0
offence,0
for,0

they,0
are,0
answerable,0

Gentlemen,0
",",0
I,0
shall,0
state,0
shortly,0
the,0
points,0
to,0
which,0
your,0
attention,0
ought,0
to,0
be,0
directed,0
.,0
I,0
think,0
it,0
appears,0
by,0
the,0
evidence,0
",",0
that,0
after,0
the,0
7th,0
of,0
April,0
",",0
when,0
the,0
agreement,0

at,0

refused,0

come,0
to,0

struck,0

now,0
",",0
if,0
they,0
did,0
strike,0

that,0
was,0
certainly,0
an,0
act,0
that,0
tended,0
to,0
impoverish,0
the,0
trade,0
;,0
and,0
if,0
so,0
",",0
the,0
next,0
question,0
is,0
",",0
whether,0

in,0
consequence,0
of,0
any,0
proceeding,0
which,0
took,0
place,0
by,0
Atkinson,0

of,0
the,0

took,0

out,0

You,0
have,0
been,0
told,0

it,0
does,0

that,0
pursuing,0

they,0
might,0
not,0
do,0
the,0
acts,0
stated,0
upon,0
the,0
indictment,0

they,0
may,0
have,0
taken,0
the,0
advantage,0
of,0
that,0
meeting,0
to,0
apply,0
it,0
to,0
other,0
purposes,0

are,0
illegal,0

therefore,0
it,0
is,0
for,0
you,0
to,0
collect,0
from,0
the,0

you,0
think,0
you,0
can,0
fairly,0
draw,0
that,0
conclusion,0

you,0
will,0
find,0
