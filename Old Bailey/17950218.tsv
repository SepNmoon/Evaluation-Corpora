now,0
this,0
will,0
fully,0
appear,0

there,0

it,0
either,0
performed,0
by,0

only,0

known,0

when,0
a,0
new,0

invented,0
by,0
an,0

One,0
Antoine,B-pers
Brucher,I-pers
was,0

first,0
who,0

for,0

coining,0

c.,0
(,0
And,0
then,0
he,0
goes,0
on,0
describing,0
the,0

parts,0

From,0
whence,0
it,0
is,0
plain,0
that,0
the,0
operation,0
of,0

is,0
a,0
different,0
thing,0
from,0
the,0
edging,0

it,0
is,0
milled,0
money,0
before,0
it,0
is,0
edged,0
money,0

therefore,0
these,0
marks,0
on,0
the,0
edge,0
are,0
not,0
property,0
attributed,0
to,0
a,0
description,0
of,0
this,0
kind,0
",",0
in,0
fact,0
",",0
it,0
was,0
milled,0
money,0
before,0
these,0
marks,0
were,0
put,0
on,0
it,0
",",0
therefore,0
the,0
description,0
of,0
milled,0
money,0
is,0
perfectly,0
right,0
",",0
because,0
the,0
milling,0
must,0
be,0
performed,0
before,0
it,0
is,0
edged,0
",",0
therefore,0
the,0
judges,0
are,0
all,0
of,0
opinion,0
that,0
the,0
indictment,0
was,0
rightly,0
laid,0
",",0
consequently,0
the,0
prisoner,0
rightly,0
convicted,0
",",0
and,0
as,0
all,0
the,0
cases,0
are,0
similar,0
",",0
it,0
will,0
affect,0
all,0
the,0
four,0
prisoners,0

who,0
are,0
to,0
receive,0
judgment,0
accordingly,0
