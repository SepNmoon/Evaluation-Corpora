it,0

capable,0

are,0

by,0
the,0
transfer,0
the,0
property,0
did,0
vest,0
in,0

and,0
if,0
he,0
had,0
died,0
before,0

the,0
stock,0
would,0
have,0
gone,0

his,0
executors,0

part,0
of,0
his,0
personal,0
estate,0
;,0
secondly,0
",",0
if,0
William,B-pers
Harrison,I-pers
had,0
no,0
stock,0

that,0
would,0
not,0
vary,0

case,0

for,0
the,0

it,0

that,0

to,0
be,0

if,0
there,0
was,0
no,0

of,0
William,B-pers

the,0
attempt,0

upon,0

property,0
did,0
vest,0
in,0

stock,0
would,0
have,0
gone,0

part,0
of,0
his,0
personal,0

secondly,0
",",0
if,0

had,0
no,0
stock,0

that,0
would,0
not,0
vary,0

case,0

compleat,0

it,0
imports,0
that,0
there,0
is,0

stock,0
to,0
be,0
transferred,0

if,0
there,0
was,0

censure,0
could,0
not,0

in,0

upon,0
the,0
idea,0
