with,0

and/or,0
the,0

have,0
made,0
an,0

.,0
December,0
1772,0
seems,0
implausibly,0
early,0
for,0
such,0
a,0
declaration,0
",",0
and,0
Mary,0
Hamilton,0
would,0
have,0
been,0
only,0
16,0
years,0
old,0

.,0
If,0
Hope,0
made,0
a,0
slip,0
with,0
the,0

however,0

then,0
other,0

",",0
very,0
plausibly,0
",",0
Sunday,0
12,0
December,0
1773,0
.,0
This,0
is,0
consonant,0
with,0
a,0
planned,0
trip,0
by,0
Hamilton,0
to,0
London,0
without,0
her,0
mother,0
(,0
see,0
HAM/1/19/56,0
of,0
11,0
October,0
1773,0
),0
.,0
It,0
also,0
fits,0
with,0
letters,0
expressing,0
regret,0
at,0
having,0
‘,0
imprudently,0

...,0
],0
debarr,0
'd,0
himself,0

from,0

company,0
(,0
HAM/1/6/8/7,0
),0
and,0
having,0
forfeited,0
Mrs,0
Hamilton,0
's,0
friendship,0
(,0
HAM/1/6/8/2,0
),0
.,0
It,0
may,0
also,0
be,0
relevant,0
that,0
Hamilton,0
has,0
apparently,0
told,0
William,0
Napier,0
in,0
early,0
1774,0
that,0
Mrs,0
Rogers,0
and,0
another,0
neighbour,0
were,0
not,0
to,0
be,0
trusted,0
(,0
HAM/1/19/62,0
),0
.,0
The,0
date,0
of,0
12,0
December,0
1783,0
has,0
therefore,0
been,0
tentatively,0
assumed,0
for,0
the,0
present,0
letter,0
