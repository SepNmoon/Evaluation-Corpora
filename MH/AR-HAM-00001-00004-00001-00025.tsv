Dear,0
Miſs,B-pers
Hamilton,I-pers
I,0
believe,0
you,0
are,0
sufficiently,0
persuaded,0
that,0
my,0
regard,0
for,0
you,0
did,0
not,0
originate,0
from,0
the,0
circumstance,0
of,0
your,0
flattering,0
situation,0
in,0
the,0
Royal,0
Family,0
;,0
and,0
tho,0
',0
I,0
may,0
now,0
lament,0
your,0
decided,0
resolution,0
of,0
withdrawing,0
yourself,0
from,0
it,0
",",0
which,0
I,0
shou,0
'd,0
with,0
difficulty,0
have,0
approved,0
",",0
had,0
I,0
even,0
been,0
acquainted,0
with,0
your,0
motives,0
for,0
taking,0
such,0
a,0
step,0
;,0
yet,0
you,0
will,0
find,0
in,0
me,0
the,0
same,0
steady,0
attachment,0
through,0
every,0
change,0
of,0
situation,0
that,0
may,0
be,0
appointed,0
for,0
you,0
.,0
From,0
my,0
recollection,0
of,0
some,0
particulars,0
in,0
our,0
conversation,0
when,0
you,0
was,0
last,0
in,0
Town,0
",",0
I,0
judge,0
that,0
you,0
had,0
not,0
then,0
taken,0
this,0
resolution,0
.,0
I,0
hope,0
you,0
may,0
never,0
have,0
reason,0
to,0
repent,0
it,0
&,0
that,0
after,0
having,0
made,0
so,0
large,0
a,0
sacrifice,0
you,0
may,0
not,0
be,0
disappointed,0
of,0
the,0
objects,0
that,0
prompted,0
you,0
to,0
it,0
.,0
As,0
you,0
are,0
to,0
be,0
so,0
soon,0
in,0
Town,0
I,0
suspend,0
any,0
further,0
reflections,0
upon,0
this,0
matter,0
