and,0
as,0
you,0
have,0
desired,0
my,0
opinion,0
upon,0
a,0
step,0

you,0
think,0
advisable,0
to,0
take,0
with,0
regard,0
to,0

I,0
take,0
this,0
first,0
opportunity,0
of,0
aſsuring,0
you,0
that,0
I,0
perfectly,0
agree,0
with,0
you,0
upon,0
the,0
propriety,0
of,0
it,0

and,0
moreover,0
think,0
that,0
this,0
diminution,0
of,0
your,0
little,0
capital,0
will,0
be,0
of,0
no,0
consequence,0

Mrs.,B-pers

requires,0
no,0
further,0
proofs,0
of,0
your,0
tenderdeſstenderness,0
&,0
affection,0
for,0
her,0
yet,0
you,0
will,0
undoubtedly,0
feel,0
a,0
secret,0
satisfaction,0
in,0
the,0
reflection,0
of,0
having,0
doubled,0
your,0
attentions,0
at,0
this,0
critical,0
time,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
no,0
opinion,0
of,0
German,0
Doctors,0

their,0
prescriptions,0
are,0
commonly,0
too,0
rough,0

I,0
have,0
often,0
heard,0
of,0
Dr.,B-pers
Burton,I-pers

think,0
you,0

not,0

Person,0

that,0
I,0
really,0
know,0

what,0
we,0
are,0
to,0
expect,0

it,0
is,0
impossible,0
that,0
Rents,0
shou,0

be,0
paid,0

When,0
arrived,0
to,0
the,0
age,0
of,0
fifty,0

it,0
is,0
time,0
to,0
be,0
discouraged,0
from,0
the,0
pursuit,0
of,0
favors,0
that,0
I,0
had,0
good,0
reason,0
to,0
expect,0
for,0
these,0
twenty,0
years,0

It,0
is,0
matter,0
of,0
real,0
