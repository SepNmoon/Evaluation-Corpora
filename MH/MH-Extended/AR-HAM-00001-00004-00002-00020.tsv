My,0
dear,0
Sir,0
",",0
I,0
am,0
much,0
flatter,0
'd,0
by,0
your,0
very,0
kind,0
letter,0
which,0
indicates,0
the,0
goodneſs,0
of,0
your,0
heart,0
in,0
the,0
oblivion,0
of,0
past,0
misunderstandings,0
which,0
I,0
equally,0
regret,0
their,0
ever,0
having,0
taken,0
place,0
;,0
too,0
ardent,0
a,0
disposition,0
frequently,0
leads,0
us,0
beyond,0
the,0
bounds,0
of,0
discretion,0

this,0
is,0
a,0
subject,0
to,0
be,0
no,0
longer,0
dwelt,0
upon,0

I,0
am,0
very,0
sorry,0
to,0

account,0

I,0
can,0
not,0
say,0
much,0
for,0
my,0
self,0
on,0
that,0
score,0

the,0
consequences,0
of,0
the,0
great,0
loſs,0
I,0
have,0
sustain,0

still,0

very,0
heavy,0
upon,0

with,0
the,0
weight,0
of,0
years,0
render,0
me,0
almost,0
unfit,0
for,0
society,0

to,0
which,0
the,0
circumstance,0
of,0
encreasing,0
deafneſs,0
adds,0
much,0
to,0
the,0
uncomfortableneſs,0
of,0
my,0
situation,0

makes,0
me,0
totally,0
averse,0
to,0

live,0
in,0

that,0
I,0
may,0
say,0
my,0
chief,0
amusement,0
is,0
in,0
trivial,0

goes,0
on,0

was,0
brought,0
on,0
by,0
the,0
constant,0

severe,0
agitation,0
