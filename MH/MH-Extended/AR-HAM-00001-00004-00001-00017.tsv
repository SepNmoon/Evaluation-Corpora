Dear,0
Miſs,B-pers
Hamilton,I-pers
;,0
The,0
hurry,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
in,0
for,0
some,0
time,0
past,0
in,0
moving,0
my,0
Family,0
to,0
Town,0

has,0
prevented,0
my,0
thanking,0
you,0
for,0
your,0
last,0
of,0
the,0
8,0
th,0

Inst,0

much,0
longer,0
than,0
I,0
cou,0
'd,0
have,0
wish,0

.,0
I,0
have,0
by,0
good,0
fortune,0
got,0
a,0
most,0
elegant,0
and,0
complete,0
house,0
in,0
every,0
respect,0
in,0
the,0
best,0
street,0
in,0
Dublin,B-place
",",0
and,0
quite,0
convenient,0
to,0
the,0
outlet,0
leading,0
to,0
my,0
Villa,0
",",0
from,0
whence,0
I,0
am,0
every,0
morning,0
supplied,0
with,0
the,0
produce,0
of,0
my,0
little,0
Farm,0
&,0
Garden,0
in,0
much,0
greater,0
perfection,0
than,0
I,0
cou,0
'd,0
get,0
the,0
same,0
things,0
from,0
the,0
market,0
.,0
I,0
am,0
sincerely,0
happy,0
in,0
the,0
account,0
you,0
give,0
me,0
of,0
your,0
encreasing,0
good,0
fortune,0
",",0
and,0
am,0
persuaded,0
that,0
the,0
same,0
prudence,0
that,0
guided,0
you,0
in,0
your,0
former,0
situation,0
",",0
will,0
point,0
out,0
the,0
proper,0
line,0
line,0
of,0
conduct,0
in,0
your,0
present,0
more,0
arduous,0
one,0
.,0
Your,0
understanding,0
with,0
the,0
experience,0
you,0
have,0
had,0
is,0
perfectly,0
sufficient,0
to,0
direct,0
you,0
in,0
almost,0
any,0
case,0
that,0
can,0
offer,0
;,0
nothing,0
can,0
hurt,0
you,0
but,0
flattery,0
which,0
I,0
know,0
you,0
have,0
always,0
held,0
in,0
abhorrence,0
;,0
its,0
object,0
is,0
fatally,0
bent,0
to,0
undermine,0
the,0
judgement,0
by,0
instilling,0
into,0
the,0
unguarded,0
mind,0
an,0
arrogant,0
self-approbation,0
instead,0
of,0
a,0
noble,0
simplicity,0
of,0
conduct,0
which,0
will,0
guide,0
you,0
safely,0
",",0
being,0
the,0
qualification,0
of,0
all,0
others,0
the,0
most,0
proper,0
for,0
your,0
situation,0
.,0
Make,0
no,0
apologies,0
to,0
me,0
",",0
I,0
beg,0
",",0
for,0
not,0
answering,0
my,0
letters,0
with,0
precise,0
punctuality,0
",",0
I,0
know,0
how,0
much,0
you,0
time,0
is,0
engaged,0
",",0
besides,0
the,0
very,0
idea,0
of,0
your,0
thinking,0
yourself,0
in,0
default,0
might,0
prevent,0
that,0
frankneſs,0
which,0
renders,0
your,0
correspondence,0
so,0
interesting,0
and,0
agreeable,0
.,0
I,0
received,0
a,0
letter,0
some,0
time,0
ago,0
from,0
Lady,B-pers
Stormont,I-pers
acquainting,0
me,0
with,0
the,0
application,0
she,0
had,0
made,0
in,0
my,0
favor,0
;,0
I,0
must,0
say,0
it,0
was,0
a,0
very,0
feeble,0
effort,0
and,0
that,0
it,0
merited,0
no,0
other,0
answer,0
from,0
Ld,B-pers
.,I-pers
Carlisle,I-pers
than,0
what,0
it,0
produced,0
.,0
It,0
was,0
from,0
the,B-pers
K——g,I-pers
alone,0
that,0
I,0
entertain,0
'd,0
any,0
hopes,0
",",0
and,0
I,0
find,0
that,0
Ld,B-pers
.,I-pers
Stormont,I-pers
has,0
changed,0
his,0
sentiments,0
with,0
regard,0
to,0
my,0
Memorial,0
and,0
the,0
probability,0
of,0
its,0
having,0
effect,0

for,0
when,0
I,0
shew,0
'd,0
it,0
to,0
him,0
",",0
he,0
said,0
it,0
was,0
very,0
proper,0
and,0
even,0
proposed,0
an,0
amendment,0
to,0
it,0
himself,0
",",0
which,0
I,0
agreed,0
to,0
&,0
said,0
at,0
last,0
",",0
perhaps,0
Miſs,B-pers
H,I-pers
.,I-pers
can,0
put,0
you,0
into,0
a,0
method,0
of,0
getting,0
it,0
presented,0
;,0
but,0
you,0
will,0
do,0
me,0
the,0
justice,0
to,0
recollect,0
my,0
sentiments,0
with,0
regard,0
to,0
your,0
interference,0

which,0
are,0
still,0
invariably,0
the,0
same,0
;,0
I,0
wish,0
'd,0
to,0
be,0
considerd,0
by,0
you,0
as,0
a,0
safe,0
and,0
disinterested,0
friend,0

that,0
idea,0
must,0
for,0
ever,0
have,0
been,0
loſs,0
'd,0
by,0
my,0
wanting,0
to,0
put,0
you,0
into,0
an,0
improper,0
and,0
dangerous,0
situation,0
.,0
The,0
case,0
is,0
quite,0
different,0
with,0
Ld,B-pers
.,I-pers
Stormont,I-pers
",",0
who,0
at,0
present,0
is,0
very,0
sorry,0
that,0
Ecclesiastical,0
Preferments,0
are,0
not,0
in,0
his,0
department,0

which,0
is,0
as,0
much,0
as,0
if,0
he,0
said,0

never,0
will,0
serve,0
me,0

as,0
I,0
do,0
not,0

to,0

for,0
any,0
civil,0

Do,0
not,0

My,0
Dear,0
Miſs,B-pers
Hamilton,I-pers
that,0
I,0
am,0
disappointed,0

made,0
unhappy,0
by,0
these,0
answers,0

I,0
have,0
made,0
the,0
experiment,0
of,0
the,0
estimation,0

stand,0
in,0
with,0
my,0
Friends,0

was,0
indeed,0
with,0
reluctance,0

totally,0
against,0
my,0
own,0
judgement,0

however,0
by,0
having,0
done,0
it,0

I,0
have,0
acquitted,0
myself,0

not,0
hereafter,0
be,0

with,0
having,0
fail,0

little,0

equal,0

at,0
the,0

too,0
late,0
