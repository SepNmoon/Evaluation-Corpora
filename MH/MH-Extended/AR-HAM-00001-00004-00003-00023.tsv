You	0

renewed	0
his	0
engagement	0

He	0
adduces	0
various	0
reasons	0
so	0
little	0
credible	0
,	0
that	0
I	0
have	0
the	0
strongest	0
ground	0
to	0

be	0

my	0

for	0
the	0

of	0
enabling	0

That	0

unsuccessful	0

of	0

my	0

.	0
You	0
may	0
easily	0
judge	0
what	0
I	0
have	0
suffered	0
,	0
particularly	0
as	0
the	0
suspense	0
was	0

I	0

bear	0
with	0
what	0

,	0
a	0
misfortune	0
not	0
brought	0
on	0
by	0
any	0
fault	0
of	0
mine	0
.	0
I	0
came	0
to	0
London	B-place
a	0
short	0
time	0
since	0
;	0
having	0
resolved	0
upon	0
looking	0
out	0
for	0
some	0
little	0
moderate	0
establishment	0
for	0
myself	0
,	0
here	0
;	0
as	0
the	0
air	0
of	0
Bath	B-place
never	0
agreed	0
well	0
with	0
my	0
health	0
,	0
and	0
I	0
dislike	0
it	0
as	0
a	0
residence	0
on	0
various	0

accounts	0

My	0
Father	0
likes	0
it	0
no	0
better	0
than	0
I	0
do	0
;	0
so	0
I	0
am	0
not	0
without	0
all	0
hope	0
of	0
his	0
coming	0
to	0
town	0

Should	0
he	0
,	0
however	0
,	0
not	0

am	0
sure	0
you	0
will	0
be	0
vexed	0
to	0
hear	0
this	0
ill	0
news	0

I	0
deferred	0
writing	0

because	0
I	0
was	0
still	0
in	0
the	0
hope	0
that	0
things	0
might	0
take	0
a	0
favourable	0
turn	0
;	0
but	0
that	0

now	0
extinct	0

I	0
must	0
quit	0
the	0
subject	0
;	0
for	0
it	0
is	0
too	0
painful	0
a	0
one	0
for	0
me	0
to	0
dwell	0
upon	0
.	0
I	0
was	0
very	0
sorry	0
for	0
at	0
the	0
account	0

me	0
of	0
poor	0
Mrs	B-pers
