I	0
was	0
very	0
happy	0
to	0
be	0
informed	0
that	0
you	0
had	0
freed	0
yourself	0
from	0
a	0
certain	0
embaraſsment	0
;	0
you	0
stood	0
upon	0

and	0
difficulties	0
were	0
entirely	0
on	0
your	0
side	0

such	0
a	0
situation	0
was	0
not	0
new	0
to	0
me	0

for	0
there	0
happened	0
a	0
similar	0
instance	0
in	0
my	0
own	0
family	0
more	0
than	0
fifty	0
years	0
ago	0
,	0
which	0
was	0
the	0
foundation	0
of	0
much	0
perplexity	0
and	0
of	0
little	0
credit	0
.	0
I	0
am	0
really	0
interested	0
in	0
your	0
happineſs	0
and	0
have	0
therefore	0
no	0
difficulty	0
in	0
offering	0
my	0
sentiments	0
without	0
reserve	0
.	0
As	0
you	0
mention	0
'd	0
that	0
Lady	B-pers
Stormont	I-pers
imagined	0
that	0
I	0
had	0
taken	0
it	0
amiſs	0
in	0
not	0
having	0
receiv	0
'd	0
any	0
notification	0
of	0
the	0
birth	0
of	0
her	0
second	0
son	0
,	0
I	0
took	0
the	0
opportunity	0
of	0
letting	0
her	0
know	0
,	0
in	0
very	0
civil	0
terms	0
what	0
my	0
sentiments	0
sentiments	0
were	0
upon	0
the	0
subject	0
,	0
that	0
was	0
not	0
the	0
first	0
or	0
second	0
instance	0
of	0
my	0
having	0
been	0
neglected	0
;	0
I	0
perceiv	0
'd	0
,	0
that	0
notwithstanding	0
the	0
little	0
attention	0
I	0
was	0
honor	0
'd	0
with	0
while	0
I	0
was	0
in	0
London	B-place
I	0
was	0
not	0
thought	0
worthy	0
of	0
its	0
continuance	0
;	0
and	0
that	0
the	0
old	0
system	0
was	0
recurr	0
'd	0
to	0
;	0
however	0
I	0
did	0
what	0
was	0
proper	0
on	0
my	0
part	0
,	0
and	0
wrote	0
to	0
Ld	B-pers

Stormont	I-pers
offering	0
my	0
congratulations	0
upon	0
the	0
occasion	0

What	0
their	0
ideas	0
or	0
intentions	0
may	0
be	0

not	0
easily	0
conjecture	0

they	0
are	0
I	0
believe	0

as	0
yet	0
very	0
undecided	0

If	0
they	0
are	0
not	0
themselves	0
struck	0
with	0
the	0
propriety	0
of	0
having	0
some	0
regard	0
to	0
the	0
interests	0
of	0
a	0
Person	0
so	0
nearly	0
connected	0
to	0
them	0

they	0
will	0
receive	0
little	0
trouble	0
from	0
my	0
importunities	0

myself	0
now	0
too	0
