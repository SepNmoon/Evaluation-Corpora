That	0
you	0
had	0
not	0
written	0
to	0
me	0
,	0
did	0
not	0
surprise	0
me	0
,	0
because	0
I	0
know	0
your	0
Naughtineſs	0
.	0
But	0
,	0
that	0
You	0
should	0
presume	0
to	0
be	0
ill	0
,	0
without	0
asking	0
my	0
Leave	0
,	0
is	0
quite	0
intolerable	0
.	0
It	0
is	0
therefore	0
my	0
positive	0
commands	0
,	0
that	0
You	0
regain	0
your	0
health	0
with	0
all	0
poſsible	0

as	0
You	0

You	0
desire	0
to	0
know	0
about	0
me	0

mine	0

It	0
is	0
,	0
however	0
,	0
so	0
long	0
since	0
we	0
have	0
had	0
any	0
communication	0
with	0
each	0
other	0
,	0
that	0
I	0
find	0
it	0
difficult	0
to	0
know	0
,	0
at	0
what	0
part	0
of	0
our	0
history	0
,	0
I	0
ought	0
to	0
commence	0
.	0
Perhaps	0
,	0
you	0
never	0
heard	0
that	0
my	0
eldest	0
Son	0
,	0
this	0
time	0
twelvemonth	0
,	0
announced	0
to	0
me	0
his	0
disinclination	0
to	0
becoming	0
a	0
Nabob	0
.	0
I	0
am	0
not	0
quite	0
sure	0
,	0
that	0
I	0
did	0
not	0
approve	0
of	0
his	0
sentiments	0
,	0
not	0
being	0
violently	0
attached	0
to	0
the	0
Indian	0
Tribe	0
,	0
at	0
the	0
same	0
time	0
,	0
I	0
felt	0
that	0
if	0
he	0
could	0
creditably	0
raise	0
himself	0
to	0
independance	0
,	0
and	0
restore	0
the	0
broken	0
fortune	0
of	0
his	0
family	0
,	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
a	0
desireable	0
circumstance	0
.	0
As	0
he	0
did	0
not	0
seem	0
to	0
feel	0
this	0
,	0
I	0
acquiesced	0
in	0
his	0
wishes	0
,	0
and	0
gave	0
up	0
the	0
Writership	0
I	0
had	0
secured	0
for	0
him	0
.	0
The	0
question	0
then	0
was	0
,	0
what	0
was	0
to	0
be	0
done	0
with	0
him	0
?	0
The	0
Dragoons	0
,	0
or	0
the	0
Navy	0
--	0
which	0
I	0
pleased	0
.	0
To	0
the	0
Dragoons	0
,	0
I	0
had	0
many	0
objections	0
,	0
first	0
,	0
because	0
,	0
I	0
could	0
not	0
afford	0
to	0
purchase	0
promotion	0
for	0
him	0
in	0
that	0
line	0
,	0
&	0
secondly	0
,	0
because	0
I	0
consider	0
that	0
branch	0
of	0
the	0
Military	0
Line	0
,	0
as	0
a	0
mere	0
nest	0
for	0
idleneſs	0

.	0
He	0
did	0
not	0
like	0
to	0
serve	0
in	0
the	0
Infantry	0
;	0
but	0
having	0
early	0
had	0
an	0
inclination	0
for	0
the	0
Navy	0
,	0
it	0
was	0
resolved	0
that	0
he	0
should	0
be	0
a	0
Tar	0
.	0
Accordingly	0
,	0
last	0
October	0
I	0
