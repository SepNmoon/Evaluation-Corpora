Dear,0
Miſs,B-pers
Hamilton,I-pers
I,0
have,0
deferr,0
'd,0
thanking,0
you,0
for,0
your,0
very,0
obliging,0
letter,0
much,0
longer,0
than,0
I,0
intended,0
;,0
it,0
was,0
partly,0
occasioned,0
by,0
our,0
having,0
been,0
in,0
expectation,0
of,0
seeing,0
Lord,B-pers
&,0
Lady,B-pers
Dartrey,I-pers
before,0
their,0
return,0
to,0
England,B-place
;,0
we,0
called,0
upon,0
them,0
in,0
Dublin,B-place
as,0
soon,0
as,0
we,0
heard,0
of,0
their,0
arrival,0
but,0
did,0
not,0
find,0
them,0
at,0
home,0
;,0
the,0
next,0
day,0
we,0
receiv,0
'd,0
a,0
card,0
from,0
them,0
apologizing,0
for,0
their,0
not,0
having,0
it,0
in,0
their,0
power,0
to,0
come,0
to,0
Latour,0
",",0
as,0
they,0
were,0
to,0
embark,0
for,0
England,B-place
immediately,0
.,0
I,0
do,0
not,0
wonder,0
that,0
they,0
shou,0
'd,0
be,0
in,0
Country,0
where,0
we,0
are,0
under,0
the,0
most,0
alarming,0
apprehensions,0
;,0
having,0
more,0
to,0
fear,0
",",0
shou,0
'd,0
an,0
invasion,0
take,0
place,0
from,0
our,0
internal,0
enemies,0
than,0
from,0
our,0
Invaders,0
;,0
the,0
Country,0
which,0
was,0
miserable,0
enough,0
before,0
",",0
is,0
hurt,0
extremely,0
by,0
the,0
expectation,0
of,0
that,0
formidable,0
event,0
.,0
Wherever,0
a,0
King,0
's,0
Son,0
is,0
great,0
attention,0
must,0
neceſsarily,0
be,0
given,0
to,0
him,0
",",0
and,0
I,0
apprehend,0
that,0
at,0
this,0
perilous,0
crisis,0
there,0
is,0
no,0
time,0
for,0
ceremonials,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
always,0
regarded,0
the,B-pers
Q,I-pers
.,I-pers
s,0
conduct,0
in,0
general,0
as,0
well,0
as,0
her,0
behaviour,0
to,0
her,0
Dependants,0
to,0
be,0
superiorly,0
judicious,0
as,0
well,0
as,0
very,0
gracious,0
;,0
had,0
it,0
fortunately,0
been,0
my,0
lot,0
to,0
have,0
remained,0
so,0
long,0
under,0
her,0
observation,0
as,0
that,0
she,0
might,0
have,0
become,0
acquainted,0
with,0
the,0
foundation,0
of,0
my,0
expectations,0
",",0
I,0
am,0
persuaded,0
I,0
shou,0
'd,0
not,0
have,0
been,0
so,0
long,0
neglected,0
",",0
nor,0
to,0
have,0
cause,0
to,0
lament,0
at,0
the,0
age,0
of,0
50,0
",",0
that,0
royal,0
Promises,0
",",0
so,0
often,0
repeated,0
",",0
shou,0
'd,0
have,0
had,0
so,0
little,0
effect,0
",",0
or,0
that,0
I,0
bear,0
a,0
Name,0
which,0
serves,0
only,0
to,0
remind,0
me,0
that,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
singularly,0
unfortunate,0
.,0
You,0
see,0
I,0
speak,0
my,0
sentiments,0
to,0
you,0
without,0
reserve,0
",",0
you,0
need,0
therefore,0
make,0
no,0
apology,0
for,0
doing,0
the,0
same,0
to,0
me,0

be,0
aſsured,0
