Dear,0
Mrs.,B-pers
Dickenson,I-pers
If,0
excuses,0
were,0
good,0
for,0
any,0
thing,0
I,0
shou,0
'd,0
half,0
fill,0
this,0
side,0
with,0
them,0

having,0
so,0
long,0
delay,0

to,0
you,0

Mr.,B-pers
Dickenson,I-pers
knows,0
my,0
sentiments,0
&,0
the,0
obligations,0
I,0
feel,0
myself,0
under,0
to,0
you,0
for,0
having,0
so,0
kindly,0
engaged,0
in,0
a,0
task,0
",",0
which,0
has,0
reliev,0
'd,0
me,0
from,0
much,0
embaraſsment,0
as,0
for,0
a,0
compensation,0

the,0
motive,0
of,0
friendship,0

me,0
added,0
to,0
it,0

I,0
am,0
satisfied,0
such,0
a,0
consideration,0
cou,0
'd,0
have,0
had,0
little,0
weight,0
with,0
you,0
.,0
In,0
the,0
account,0
I,0
gave,0
you,0
of,0
your,0
Friend,0
previous,0
to,0
his,0
coming,0
to,0
Taxal,B-place
",",0
I,0
certainly,0
did,0
not,0
exaggerate,0
",",0
tho,0
',0
at,0
the,0
same,0
time,0
I,0
shou,0
'd,0
indeed,0
be,0
very,0
sorry,0
to,0
hear,0
from,0
you,0
that,0
you,0
have,0
found,0
it,0
precisely,0
just,0
.,0
Deviations,0
from,0
the,0
lines,0
of,0
justice,0
and,0
truth,0
give,0
me,0
the,0
greatest,0
offence,0
",",0
no,0
palliations,0
can,0
be,0
admitted,0
",",0
nor,0
half,0
amendments,0
",",0
for,0
he,0
that,0
is,0
only,0
a,0
little,0
fal,0
se,0
or,0
dishonest,0
",",0
is,0
restrain,0
'd,0
by,0
his,0
own,0
apprehensions,0
alone,0
of,0
detection,0
from,0
becoming,0
more,0
so,0
;,0
the,0
mind,0
must,0
be,0
renovated,0
before,0
a,0
radical,0
cure,0
can,0
be,0
expected,0
.,0
In,0
the,0
letters,0
I,0
have,0
receiv,0
'd,0
from,0
my,0
Son,0
he,0
has,0
never,0
fail,0
'd,0
to,0
expreſs,0
his,0
sense,0
of,0
the,0
attention,0
&,0
civilities,0
he,0
is,0
daily,0
receiving,0
",",0
I,0
fear,0
the,0
returns,0
he,0
makes,0
to,0
you,0
are,0
not,0
adequate,0
to,0
them,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
constantly,0
aſsured,0
him,0
that,0
I,0
wou,0
'd,0
give,0
him,0
ample,0
credit,0
for,0
every,0
amendment,0
in,0
his,0
conduct,0
.,0
My,0
advice,0
lies,0
in,0
little,0
compass,0
",",0
that,0
he,0
shou,0
'd,0
have,0
the,0
mind,0
&,0
manners,0
of,0
a,0
gentleman,0
&,0
these,0
are,0
perfectly,0
compatible,0
with,0
his,0
period,0
of,0
life,0
.,0
I,0
do,0
not,0
enter,0
into,0
the,0
detail,0
of,0
the,0
errors,0
&,0
incaution,0
natural,0
to,0
youth,0
as,0
I,0
remember,0
the,0
time,0
when,0
I,0
myself,0
gave,0
no,0
great,0
attention,0
to,0
admonition,0
upon,0
such,0
topics,0
.,0
In,0
a,0
few,0
months,0
more,0
he,0
will,0
enter,0
upon,0
a,0
new,0
state,0
&,0
be,0
solely,0
responsible,0
for,0
his,0
own,0
conduct,0
&,0
engagements,0
;,0
if,0
he,0
adopts,0
an,0
honest,0
manly,0
part,0
I,0
shall,0
be,0
really,0
happy,0
&,0
there,0
will,0
be,0
an,0
union,0
in,0
our,0
interests,0
",",0
but,0
shou,0
'd,0
he,0
pursue,0
a,0
contrary,0
line,0
",",0
all,0
confidence,0
between,0
us,0
will,0
be,0
at,0
an,0
end,0
",",0
&,0
his,0
plea,0
of,0
being,0
my,0
Son,0
will,0
have,0
no,0
weight,0
when,0
he,0
has,0
no,0
other,0
recommendation,0
to,0
enforce,0
it,0
.,0
I,0
will,0
remember,0
your,0
kind,0
partiality,0
for,0
Robert,B-pers
which,0
has,0
been,0
in,0
great,0
measure,0
the,0
cause,0
of,0
my,0
intruding,0
this,0
discuſsion,0
upon,0
you,0
.,0
Whatever,0
my,0
apprehensions,0
may,0
be,0
I,0
am,0
very,0
desirous,0
of,0
knowing,0
your,0
opinion,0
of,0
him,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
observed,0
to,0
him,0
that,0
I,0
think,0
I,0
perceive,0
something,0
more,0
steady,0
in,0
him,0
since,0
his,0
visit,0
to,0
you,0
