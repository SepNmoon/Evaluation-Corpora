I	0
should	0
have	0
expected	0
to	0

from	0
her	0

as	0
her	0
Grandpapa	0
has	0
been	0
so	0
ill	0
I	0
'm	0
sure	0
her	0
time	0
has	0
been	0
too	0
much	0
taken	0
up	0
to	0

I	0
really	0
should	0
not	0

troubled	0
you	0
with	0
this	0
but	0
as	0
I	0
know	0
your	0
goodneſs	0
I	0
am	0
sure	0
you	0
will	0
forgive	0
what	0
I	0
am	0
going	0
to	0
ask	0
you	0
to	0
do	0
It	0

to	0

you	0

write	0
to	0
my	0
Aunt	0
Anna	B-pers

entreat	0
her	0
not	0

affairs	0
make	0
her	0
so	0

--	0
I	0
can	0
aſsure	0
you	0
my	0
dear	0
Mrs	B-pers
Dickenson	I-pers
that	0
she	0
is	0
more	0
Altered	0
than	0
you	0
can	0
poſsibly	0
conceive	0
&	0
I	0
am	0
really	0
fearful	0
that	0
if	0
she	0
does	0
not	0
take	0
very	0
great	0
care	0
of	0
herself	0
she	0
will	0
fall	0
into	0
a	0
dreadful	0
state	0
--	0
I	0
had	0
hoped	0
that	0
being	0
at	0
seaside	0
where	0
they	0
now	0
are	0
/	0
would	0
have	0
quite	0
restored	0
her	0
health	0
&	0
spirits	0
but	0
I	0
do	0
not	0
now	0
think	0
she	0
will	0
be	0
better	0
in	0
the	0
least	0
for	0
it	0
as	0
she	0
has	0
taken	0
I	0
believe	0
a	0
great	0
quantity	0
of	0
papers	0
relating	0
to	0
the	0
busineſs	0
with	0
her	0
over	0
which	0
she	0
will	0
I	0
know	0
be	0
inceſsantly	0
pouring	0
--	0
I	0
have	0
said	0
as	0
much	0
as	0
I	0
could	0
to	0
her	0
and	0
so	0
has	0
my	0
Aunt	0
Barnard	0
but	0
all	0
to	0
no	0
purpose	0
indeed	0
I	0
am	0
afraid	0
she	0
can	0
not	0
conquer	0
the	0
nervous	0
state	0
she	0
has	0
fallen	0
into	0
Mrs	B-pers
Watson	I-pers
the	0
person	0
with	0
whom	0
she	0
boards	0
tells	0
me	0
that	0
my	0
Aunt	0
makes	0
her	0
quite	0
melancholy	0
the	0
night	0
before	0
she	0
went	0
to	0
Ramsgate	B-place
she	0
never	0
went	0
to	0
Bed	0

was	0
employed	0
in	0
counting	0
over	0
the	0
boxes	0
papers	0

c	0
(	0
which	0
were	0
all	0
packed	0
up	0

&	0
which	0
she	0
meant	0
to	0
take	0
with	0
her	0
,	0
I	0
can	0
not	0
will	0
not	0
now	0
tell	0
you	0
of	0
all	0
these	0
trifling	0
circumstances	0
but	0
I	0
am	0
very	0
certain	0
that	0
an	0

person	0
would	0
say	0
she	0
was	0
not	0
in	0
her	0
senses	0
If	0
either	0
you	0
or	0
Mr	B-pers
Dickenson	I-pers
would	0
be	0
kind	0
enough	0
to	0

upon	0
this	0
subject	0
you	0
it	0
will	0
be	0
doing	0
me	0
a	0
very	0

I	0

have	0
a	0
strong	0
affection	0
for	0
