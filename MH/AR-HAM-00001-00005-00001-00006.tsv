I,0
am,0

when,0
I,0
might,0
have,0
escaped,0

thing,0

always,0
made,0

procrastinate,0
my,0
constant,0
intention,0

coming,0

but,0
that,0
happineſs,0
I,0
hope,0
I,0
shall,0
soon,0
have,0

What,0
gives,0

great,0
satisfaction,0

tell,0
her,0
I,0
should,0
have,0
the,0
greatest,0
pleasure,0
in,0
meeting,0
her,0

that,0
one,0
little,0
requisite,0
is,0
an,0
invitation,0

an,0
article,0
I,0
am,0
not,0
poſseſsed,0
of,0
which,0
I,0
rather,0
wonder,0
at,0
",",0

under,0
existing,0
circumstances,0
it,0
would,0
probably,0
be,0
of,0
no,0
use,0

As,0
for,0
my,0
Daughter,0

took,0
her,0

Stowe,B-place
last,0
year,0

it,0
was,0
a,0
peculiar,0
sort,0
of,0

young,0

Sister,0

last,0

what,0
she,0
calls,0
well,0

I,0
beleive,0
very,0
much,0
averse,0
to,0
writing,0

can,0
be,0
the,0
only,0
cause,0
of,0
