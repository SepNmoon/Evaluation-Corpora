an,0

you,0
have,0
almost,0
forgot,0

feel,0
myself,0
very,0
ungrateful,0

am,0
determined,0

much,0
hurried,0

this,0
pen,0
shall,0
not,0
go,0
without,0
my,0
acknowledgements,0

my,0
time,0
is,0
short,0
I,0
am,0
desirous,0
resolved,0
to,0
begin,0
on,0
the,0
subject,0

I,0
most,0
long,0
just,0

distreſses,0

I,0
have,0
already,0
mentioned,0
to,0
you,0

that,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
two,0
Months,0
without,0
interruption,0
with,0
her,0
also,0
",",0
I,0
must,0
tell,0
you,0
how,0
fortunate,0
I,0
think,0
myself,0
in,0
her,0
acquaintance,0

friendship,0

flatter,0
myself,0
I,0
may,0
claim,0
both,0

it,0
has,0
been,0
really,0
a,0
more,0
thorough,0
intimacy,0
than,0
I,0
cd,0

have,0
boasted,0
of,0

in,0

suppose,0
we,0
were,0
never,0
half,0
an,0

out,0
of,0
each,0

I,0
cd,0

more,0
highly,0
of,0
him,0

I,0
did,0
before,0

makes,0
me,0

copious,0
just,0
now,0
on,0
his,0
subject,0

but,0
I,0
must,0
say,0
nothing,0
could,0
be,0
more,0
comfortable,0
&,0
happy,0
&,0
indeed,0
merry,0
when,0
we,0
all,0
were,0
together,0

when,0
I,0
left,0

at,0
Agromonte,B-place

determined,0
to,0

up,0
all,0

of,0
seeing,0

to,0

the,0
next,0
Winter,0
at,0
Lisbon,B-place

in,0

but,0
I,0
hope,0
it,0
will,0
be,0
the,0
former,0
as,0
it,0
agreed,0
so,0
well,0
with,0
her,0
last,0
year,0

she,0
was,0
afraid,0
that,0
this,0
determination,0

be,0
a,0
great,0
disappointment,0
to,0
her,0
friends,0
in,0

a,0
mortification,0

certainly,0
will,0
be,0

be,0
better,0
for,0
