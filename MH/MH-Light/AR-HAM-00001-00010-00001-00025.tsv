My,0
dear,0
Friend,0
I,0
was,0
much,0
gratified,0
by,0
the,0
receipt,0
of,0
yours,0
&,0
happy,0
to,0
learn,0
that,0
my,0
dear,0
Lady,B-pers
Anson,I-pers
&,0
your,0
Family,0
were,0
well,0

a,0
sad,0
bar,0
to,0
the,0
comforts,0
of,0
society,0
&,0
a,0
Bulletin,0
of,0
health,0
is,0
extremely,0
interesting,0
were,0
you,0
to,0
add,0
no,0
more,0
I,0
wish,0
you,0
would,0
reflect,0
on,0
this,0
&,0
give,0
me,0
a,0
few,0
lines,0
on,0
your,0
return,0
from,0
the,0
delightful,0
Tour,0
you,0
have,0
in,0
contemplation,0
the,0
time,0
of,0
your,0
intended,0
departure,0
you,0
did,0
not,0
mention,0
however,0
I,0
will,0
direct,0
this,0
to,0
yourself,0
or,0
dear,0
Louisa,B-pers
that,0
in,0
case,0
you,0
should,0
have,0
taken,0
your,0
flight,0
it,0
may,0
not,0
be,0
any,0
trouble,0
to,0
you,0
What,0
you,0
said,0
respecting,0
our,0
residing,0
at,0
this,0
distance,0
interests,0
me,0
as,0
I,0
have,0
the,0
same,0
sentiments,0
on,0
the,0
subject,0
:,0
our,0
being,0
fixed,0
here,0
which,0
seems,0
to,0
be,0
the,0
case,0
does,0
not,0
happen,0
in,0
consequence,0
of,0
Isabella,B-pers
's,0
health,0
only,0
my,0
own,0
from,0
debility,0
of,0
constitution,0
though,0
I,0
thank,0
God,0
I,0
enjoy,0
a,0
good,0
state,0
of,0
health,0
&,0
am,0
exempted,0
from,0
all,0
pain,0
&,0
suffering,0
at,0
present,0
",",0
appears,0
to,0
require,0
the,0
bracing,0
air,0
of,0
the,0
Sea-Coast,0
I,0
have,0
scarcely,0
any,0
degree,0
of,0
strength,0
&,0
this,0
air,0
with,0
constantly,0
taking,0
the,0
tincture,0
of,0
bark,0
appears,0
to,0
revive,0
me,0
in,0
an,0
extraordinary,0
manner,0
I,0
was,0
affected,0
by,0
a,0
severe,0
Cough,0
at,0
Kensington,B-place
though,0
the,0
winter,0
was,0
mild,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
here,0
a,0
year,0
without,0
a,0
Cold,0
or,0
the,0
least,0
tendency,0
to,0
coughing,0
added,0
to,0
this,0
inducement,0
the,0
air,0
agrees,0
with,0
my,0
Sister,0
whose,0
health,0
is,0
more,0
imperfect,0
than,0
mine,0
&,0
the,0
consideration,0
of,0
expence,0
as,0
we,0
can,0
have,0
a,0
very,0
comfortable,0
&,0
neatly,0
furnished,0
Lodging,0
at,0
Deal,0
for,0
nearly,0
half,0
the,0
price,0
which,0
makes,0
a,0
considerable,0
difference,0
in,0
our,0
Income,0
.,0
I,0
had,0
a,0
very,0
kind,0
invitation,0
from,0
Mrs,B-pers
Steers,I-pers
in,0
the,0
spring,0
which,0
I,0
could,0
not,0
accept,0
&,0
have,0
just,0
received,0
another,0
to,0
go,0
to,0
Chelsea,B-place
in,0
the,0
Autumn,0
which,0
perhaps,0
I,0
may,0
avail,0
myself,0
of,0
for,0
a,0
month,0
I,0
fear,0
you,0
will,0
will,0
not,0
be,0
returned,0
from,0
your,0
Northern,0
expedition,0
--,0
with,0
Mrs,B-pers
Steers,I-pers
I,0
am,0
at,0
liberty,0
to,0
visit,0
my,0
friends,0
in,0
Town,0
she,0
is,0
glad,0
to,0
have,0
me,0
gratified,0
by,0
the,0
society,0
of,0
those,0
I,0
love,0
as,0
well,0
as,0
as,0
by,0
hers,0
&,0
if,0
I,0
should,0
not,0
want,0
resolution,0
on,0
the,0
occasion,0
I,0
shall,0
sometimes,0
make,0
her,0
a,0
visit,0
I,0
think,0
I,0
could,0
leave,0
my,0
Sister,0
with,0
all,0
neceſsary,0
comforts,0
as,0
the,0
person,0
with,0
whom,0
we,0
now,0
lodge,0
would,0
be,0
very,0
attentive,0
to,0
her,0

engage,0
a,0
very,0
worthy,0
Girl,0
to,0
serve,0
us,0
--,0
&,0
we,0
have,0
another,0
to,0
go,0
out,0
with,0
her,0
(,0
the,0
Daughter,0
of,0
our,0
Landlady,0
),0
on,0
account,0
of,0
her,0
deafneſs,0
which,0
has,0
of,0
late,0
years,0
increased,0
--,0
I,0
thank,0
you,0
for,0
the,0
interesting,0
account,0
you,0
give,0
of,0
the,0
3,0
dear,0
Children,0
it,0
pleases,0
me,0
to,0
hear,0
that,0
the,0
youngest,0
resemble,0
his,0
amiable,0
Mother,0
because,0
she,0
is,0
such,0
a,0
striking,0
likeneſs,0
of,0
my,0
beloved,0
Friend,0
which,0
makes,0
a,0
strong,0
impreſsion,0
on,0
my,0
mind,0
whenever,0
I,0
look,0
at,0
her,0
I,0
believe,0
the,0
resemblance,0
is,0
in,0
the,0
Eyes,0
&,0
form,0
of,0
the,0
face,0
--,0
àpropos,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
some,0

employed,0

destroying,0

Friends,0
in,0

t,0
&,0
I,0
am,0

exceſsively,0
interested,0
in,0
reading,0
over,0
some,0
of,0
yours,0
&,0
my,0
dear,0
Friend,0
it,0
is,0
a,0
sad,0
but,0
swet,0
sweet,0
gratification,0
folios,0
from,0
Bullstrode,0
the,0
account,0
of,0
your,0
introduction,0
there,0
&,0
how,0
much,0
you,0
were,0
liked,0
encomiums,0
of,0
our,0
dear,0
friend,0
in,0
yourself,0
such,0
anxiety,0
respecting,0
the,0
suspence,0
&,0
difficulties,0
of,0
some,0
circumstances,0
not,0
explained,0
that,0
she,0
could,0
not,0
continue,0
the,0
Diary,0
you,0
attribute,0
to,0
my,0
memory,0
my,0
dear,0
friend,0
more,0
than,0
it,0

though,0
it,0
is,0
I,0
think,0
a,0
tenacious,0
one,0
in,0
many,0
respects,0
I,0
thought,0
I,0
had,0
seen,0
you,0
the,0
first,0

came,0
to,0

you,0
were,0

believe,0
I,0
was,0
at,0
Horwood,B-place

my,0
dear,0
Sister,0

I,0
think,0
I,0
can,0
say,0
that,0
I,0
was,0
about,0
when,0
you,0
were,0
at,0
Mr.,B-pers
Glover,I-pers

as,0
I,0

no,0
