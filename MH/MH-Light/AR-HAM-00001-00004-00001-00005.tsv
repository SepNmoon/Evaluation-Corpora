Dear,0
Miſs,B-pers
Hamilton,I-pers
I,0
was,0
much,0
concern,0
'd,0
to,0
hear,0
by,0
a,0
letter,0
I,0
receiv,0
'd,0
yesterday,0
from,0
Miſs,B-pers
Clarke,I-pers
that,0
you,0
had,0
lately,0
been,0
so,0
much,0
indisposed,0
&,0
had,0
been,0
so,0
unfortunate,0
as,0
to,0
have,0
relapsed,0
after,0
having,0
been,0
nearly,0
recover,0
'd,0
from,0
a,0
former,0
illneſs,0
;,0
I,0
shoud,0
suffer,0
the,0
greatest,0
anxiety,0
if,0
Miſs,B-pers
Clarke,I-pers
had,0
not,0
aſsured,0
me,0
that,0
you,0
were,0
recovering,0
fast,0
and,0
regaining,0
your,0
appetite,0
by,0
the,0
benefit,0
of,0
the,0
Country,0
air,0
.,0
I,0
hope,0
you,0
will,0
not,0
suffer,0
again,0
by,0
an,0
impatience,0
to,0
return,0
to,0
your,0
attendance,0
",",0
before,0
you,0
find,0
yourself,0
perfectly,0
restored,0
",",0
nor,0
suffer,0
yourself,0
to,0
be,0
too,0
anxious,0
upon,0
that,0
subject,0
;,0
you,0
may,0
be,0
sure,0
that,0
a,0
very,0
hasty,0
return,0
will,0
not,0
be,0
expected,0
as,0
it,0
must,0
take,0
a,0
certain,0
time,0
before,0
the,0
strength,0
&,0
spirits,0
can,0
be,0
recover,0
'd,0
after,0
such,0
an,0
illneſs,0
",",0
when,0
that,0
time,0
comes,0
I,0
hope,0
to,0
be,0
favor,0
'd,0
with,0
a,0
letter,0
from,0
yourself,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
much,0
engaged,0
for,0
some,0
time,0
past,0
in,0
making,0
preparations,0
for,0
my,0
residence,0
at,0
a,0
place,0
about,0
three,0
miles,0
from,0
Dublin,B-place
which,0
turns,0
out,0
far,0
beyond,0
my,0
expectations,0
as,0
it,0
is,0
indeed,0
uncommonly,0
beautiful,0
&,0
the,0
House,0
is,0
answerable,0
to,0
it,0
",",0
we,0
propose,0
to,0
remove,0
there,0
by,0
the,0
end,0
of,0
next,0
month,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
been,0
so,0
long,0
a,0
dupe,0
to,0
expectations,0
of,0
further,0
Preferment,0
",",0
which,0
I,0
had,0
certainly,0
great,0
reason,0
to,0
expect,0
in,0
as,0
much,0
as,0
they,0
were,0
founded,0
upon,0
repeated,0
promises,0
of,0
Persons,0
who,0
might,0
have,0
served,0
me,0
that,0
I,0
now,0
entertain,0
but,0
small,0
hopes,0
upon,0
that,0
subject,0

My,0
residence,0
upon,0
my,0
Living,0
in,0
the,0
farthest,0
northern,0
part,0
of,0
Ireland,B-place
is,0
expected,0
&,0
may,0
probably,0
be,0
insisted,0
upon,0

which,0
wou,0
'd,0
be,0
the,0
finishing,0
stroke,0
of,0
my,0
perverse,0
fortune,0

for,0
as,0
it,0
is,0
situated,0
in,0
a,0
most,0
disagreeable,0
climate,0

I,0
must,0
sooner,0
determine,0
to,0
resign,0
my,0
Living,0

attend,0
to,0
what,0

duty,0
among,0
a,0
set,0
of,0
People,0

have,0
an,0
unconquerable,0
aversion,0
to,0
the,0

as,0
being,0
by,0
no,0

Constitution,0

I,0
am,0
labouring,0
if,0

to,0
procure,0
a,0
small,0
Living,0
in,0
the,0
neighbourhood,0
of,0
my,0
House,0
near,0
Dublin,B-place
which,0
wou,0
'd,0
give,0
me,0
an,0
option,0
in,0
point,0
of,0
residence,0
&,0
with,0
propriety,0
dispense,0
with,0
my,0
removal,0
to,0
a,0
place,0
that,0
I,0
have,0
always,0
abhor,0
'd,0
.,0
I,0
have,0
applied,0
to,0
the,0
Ld,0
Lieutenant,0
upon,0
this,0
subject,0
but,0
as,0
my,0
request,0
has,0
no,0
other,0
advocate,0
to,0
support,0
it,0

myself,0
it,0
is,0
not,0
propable,0

will,0
meet,0
with,0

expensive,0

extravagant,0

have,0
fixed,0

in,0

doing,0

can,0
not,0
