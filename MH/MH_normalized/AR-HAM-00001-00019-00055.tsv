as	O
you	O

.	O
your	O
House	O
is	O
most	O
extravagant	O
but	O
at	O
all	O

now	O
they	O
suck	O
the	O

in	O

I	O
am	O
extremely	O
glad	O
you	O

tho	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
approve	O
of	O

books	O
of	O
controverſy	O
I	O
think	O
its	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
study	O
for	O
any	O
body	O
but	O
more	O
especially	O
for	O
young	O
Lady	O
's	O
,	O
if	O
I	O
ever	O
read	O
any	O
I	O
certainly	O
would	O
read	O
Beattie	B-pers
on	O
your	O
recommendation	O
but	O
the	O
Bible	O
guides	O
my	O
faith	O
entirely	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
reſolved	O
to	O
read	O
nothing	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
but	O
itself	O
as	O
I	O
am	O
ſure	O
there	O
is	O
more	O
there	O
then	O
ever	O
I	O
shall	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
practise	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
&	O
all	O
kind	O
of	O
Controve	O
rſy	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
tends	O
to	O
hurts	O
minds	O
especially	O
young	O
ones	O
&	O
tho	O
Beattie	B-pers
may	O
be	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
side	O
yet	O
if	O
a	O
more	O
ſenſible	O
Man	O
happens	O
to	O
anſwer	O
him	O
,	O
he	O
may	O
do	O
much	O
more	O
harm	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
does	O
good	O
for	O
which	O
reaſon	O
I	O
am	O
of	O
opinion	O
its	O
best	O
not	O
to	O
read	O
those	O
books	O

--	O
So	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
be	O
ſaucy	O
because	O
you	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
in	O
to	O
your	O
very	O
wise	O
noddle	O
that	O
I	O
brought	O
my	O
last	O
illneſs	O
on	O
my	O
self	O
by	O
flying	O
from	O
Margate	B-place
,	O
but	O
for	O
all	O
your	O
obstinacy	O
know	O
by	O
these	O
Preſents	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
ill	O
before	O
I	O
left	O
Buxton	B-place
&	O
that	O
the	O
Phiſicians	O
says	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
crisis	O
of	O
my	O
Complaints	O
for	O
many	O
years	O
past	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
go	O
to	O

for	O
the	O
Asthmatic	O
complaints	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
as	O
good	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
sleep	O
in	O
the	O

&	O
that	O
it	O

have	O

laid	O
up	O
in	O
ſome	O

where	O

&	O
I	O

upon	O
the	O

I	O
believe	O

as	O
it	O
is	O
,	O
&	O
I	O
so	O
far	O
from	O

I	O
should	O
