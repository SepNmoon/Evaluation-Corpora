this	O
Evening	O
on	O
purpose	O
to	O
write	O
to	O
you	O

tell	O
you	O
my	O
feelings	O

much	O

better	O

I.	O
I	O
do	O

I	O
ever	O
experienced	O
such	O
a	O
disappointment	O
in	O
my	O
Life	O
as	O
the	O
news	O
you	O
sent	O
us	O
of	O
Your	O

With	O
what	O
pleasure	O
did	O
I	O
look	O

the	O
approaching	O
Day	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
once	O
more	O
to	O

my	O

How	O
had	O
I	O
cun	O
counted	O
the	O
Days	O
I	O
may	O
even	O
say	O
Hours	O
,	O
and	O
Minutes	O
;	O
and	O
looked	O
upon	O
the	O
whole	O
as	O
so	O
much	O
lost	O
time	O
till	O
your	O
return	O
.	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
I	O
may	O
safely	O
say	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
first	O
thing	O
I	O
thought	O
of	O
in	O
a	O
morning	O
and	O
the	O
last	O
at	O
night	O
.	O
It	O
was	O
my	O
only	O
consolation	O
for	O
our	O
be	O
ing	O
in	O
Town	B-place
,	O
and	O
your	O
being	O
absent	O
for	O
these	O
3	O
Weeks	O
,	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
one	O
fortnight	O
comfortably	O
together	O
;	O
and	O
now	O
see	O
how	O
all	O
my	O
hopes	O
are	O
vanished	O
!	O
If	O
we	O
meet	O
at	O
all	O
it	O
will	O
only	O
be	O
to	O

again	O
;	O
to	O
part	O

not	O
to	O

again	O
this	O

;	O
for	O
if	O
once	O
the	O
Northamptonshire	B-place
Clay	O
lays	O

I	O
fear	O
it	O
will	O
detain	O
us	O
the	O
whole	O

then	O
I	O

half	O

I	O
think	O
you	O
pity	O
me	O
;	O
perhaps	O
you	O
only	O
laugh	O
at	O
my	O
Weakneſs	O
;	O
Your	O
Friends	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
now	O
with	O
are	O
much	O
finer	O

greater	O
than	O

ever	O

be	O
,	O
and	O
have	O
much	O
greater	O
Powers	O
of	O
amusing	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
may	O
not	O
make	O
them	O
more	O
sincere	O
;	O
I	O
only	O
hope	O
that	O
some	O
occasion	O
may	O
happy	O
happen	O
to	O

you	O
that	O
tho	O
'	O
your	O

is	O
much	O
humbler	O
he	O
is	O
quite	O

and	O
I	O
really	O
think	O
it	O
from	O

that	O
I	O

Indeed	O
if	O

I	O
should	O

aſsured	O
I	O

We	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
Eſsex	B-place
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
came	O
to	O
London	B-place
yesterday	O
in	O
full	O
perſsu	O
persuasion	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
have	O
spent	O
this	O
Evening	O
,	O
with	O
you	O
;	O
but	O
instead	O
of	O
that	O
we	O
only	O
heard	O
that	O
piercing	O
news	O
;	O
the	O
account	O
was	O
immediately	O
and	O
triumphantly	O
brought	O
to	O
be	O
me	O
(	O
by	O
a	O
Person	O
whom	O
good	O
nature	O
forbids	O
me	O
to	O

before	O
I	O
was	O
hardly	O
off	O
my	O

with	O
such	O
a	O
face	O
as	O
bespoke	O
the	O
pleasure	O
it	O
the	O
Person	O
had	O
in	O
declaring	O
and	O
the	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
Pain	O
it	O
would	O
give	O
me	O

I	O
am	O
certain	O
that	O

very	O
little	O

for	O
you	O

We	O
are	O
engaged	O
to	O
a	O
Ball	O
at	O
Epping	B-place
next	O
Friday	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
vain	O
enough	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
perhaps	O
have	O
been	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
,	O
not	O
for	O
any	O
pleasure	O
you	O
could	O
have	O
derived	O
from	O
a	O
Country	O
aſsembly	O
,	O
but	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
accompanying	O
my	O
Mother	O
who	O
can	O
not	O
go	O
since	O
she	O
has	O
no	O
Lady	O
to	O
go	O
with	O
her	O
;	O
and	O
therefore	O
we	O
shall	O
be	O
a	O
party	O
from	O
London	B-place
of	O
six	O
Gentlemen	O
,	O
without	O
a	O
single	O
Lady	O
;	O
how	O
shocking	O
!	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O
pleasant	O
Scheme	O
to	O
me	O
,	O
but	O
since	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
of	O
the	O
party	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
quite	O
the	O
contrary	O
;	O
for	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
seen	O
a	O
Woman	O
I	O
can	O
no	O
endure	O
since	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
pleasure	O
(	O
perhaps	O
I	O
should	O
say	O
the	O
misfortune	O
)	O
of	O
knowing	O
you	O

I	O
fear	O
I	O
have	O
intruded	O
to	O
much	O
on	O
your	O
time	O
already	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
sadly	O
afraid	O
I	O
have	O
wrote	O
nothing	O

a	O
a	O
