My	O

Mrs	B-pers
Dickenson	I-pers
You	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
imagine	O
that	O
,	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
your	O
letter	O
to	O
Fanny	B-pers
which	O
related	O
to	O
me	O
has	O
given	O
considerable	O
uneasineſs	O
,	O
not	O
from	O
any	O
consciousneſs	O
of	O
having	O
acted	O
wrong	O
but	O
from	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
lost	O
the	O
friendship	O
you	O
have	O
ever	O
Shown	O
towards	O
&	O
which	O
I	O
can	O
with	O
sincerity	O
aſsure	O
you	O
I	O
shou	O
'd	O
ever	O
have	O
been	O
most	O
anxious	O
to	O
have	O
retained	O
.	O
With	O
regard	O
to	O
my	O
own	O
Conduct	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
whatever	O
I	O
have	O
done	O
has	O
proceeded	O
from	O
the	O
motive	O
of	O
doing	O
what	O
I	O
thought	O
right	O
,	O
therefore	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
erred	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
through	O
fear	O
of	O
having	O
thought	O
ungrateful	O
by	O
those	O
to	O
whom	O
I	O
owed	O
so	O
much	O
--	O
Had	O
I	O
left	O
the	B-pers
Bishop	I-pers
immediately	O
upon	O
the	O
death	O
of	O
his	B-pers
Wife	I-pers
,	O
when	O
he	O
was	O
in	O
the	O
deepest	O
affliction	O
for	O
her	O
loſs	O
,	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
but	O
think	O
it	O
wou	O
'd	O
have	O
appeared	O
very	O
unkind	O
and	O
the	O
more	O
so	O
,	O
as	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
from	O
circumstances	O
in	O
his	O
own	O
Family	O
he	O
was	O
prevented	O
having	O
either	O
his	O
Son	O
or	O
Daughter	B-pers
with	O
him	O
;	O
I	O
confeſs	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
think	O
the	O
world	O
cou	O
'd	O
be	O
so	O
illnatured	O
as	O
to	O
spread	O
reports	O
of	O
the	O
nature	O
you	O
allude	O
to	O
about	O
me	O
,	O
&	O
it	O
was	O
still	O
farther	O
from	O
my	O
thoughts	O
to	O
suppose	O
any	O
of	O
my	O
Friends	O
wou	O
'd	O
believe	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
altho	O
'	O
that	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
case	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
my	O
reputation	O
so	O
far	O
gone	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
great	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
necceſsary	O
as	O
marrying	O
a	O
Man	O
50	O
years	O
older	O
than	O
myself	O
&	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
he	O
will	O
never	O
dream	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
an	O
instant	O
--	O
I	O
believe	O
he	O
loves	O
me	O
with	O
the	O
affection	O
of	O
a	O
Father	O

as	O

any	O

I	O

to	O
my	O
