Dear	O
Miſs	B-pers
Hamilton	I-pers
I	O
believe	O
you	O
are	O
sufficiently	O
persuaded	O
that	O
my	O
regard	O
for	O
you	O
did	O
not	O
originate	O
from	O
the	O
circumstance	O
of	O
your	O
flattering	O
situation	O
in	O
the	O
Royal	O
Family	O
;	O
and	O
tho	O
'	O
I	O
may	O
now	O
lament	O
your	O
decided	O
resolution	O
of	O
withdrawing	O
yourself	O
from	O
it	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
shou	O
'd	O
with	O
difficulty	O
have	O
approved	O
,	O
had	O
I	O
even	O
been	O
acquainted	O
with	O
your	O
motives	O
for	O
taking	O
such	O
a	O
step	O
;	O
yet	O
you	O
will	O
find	O
in	O
me	O
the	O
same	O
steady	O
attachment	O
through	O
every	O
change	O
of	O
situation	O
that	O
may	O
be	O
appointed	O
for	O
you	O
.	O
From	O
my	O
recollection	O
of	O
some	O
particulars	O
in	O
our	O
conversation	O
when	O
you	O
was	O
last	O
in	O
Town	O
,	O
I	O
judge	O
that	O
you	O
had	O
not	O
then	O
taken	O
this	O
resolution	O
.	O
I	O
hope	O
you	O
may	O
never	O
have	O
reason	O
to	O
repent	O
it	O
&	O
that	O
after	O
having	O
made	O
so	O
large	O
a	O
sacrifice	O
you	O
may	O
not	O
be	O
disappointed	O
of	O
the	O
objects	O
that	O
prompted	O
you	O
to	O
it	O
.	O
As	O
you	O
are	O
to	O
be	O
so	O
soon	O
in	O
Town	O
I	O
suspend	O
any	O

reflections	O
