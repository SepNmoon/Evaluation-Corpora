a	O

comfortleſs	O
voyage	O
of	O
eleven	O

turned	O
to	O
a	O
violent	O
and	O
painful	O
attack	O
on	O
his	O
Bowels	O
,	O
strong	O
enough	O
to	O
destroy	O
any	O

for	O
24	O

in	O

was	O
for	O

lift	O

just	O
about	O
the	O

that	O

my	O

——	O

if	O
the	O

would	O
have	O

the	O

of	O
our	O

yesterday	O

the	O
whole	O

which	O
my	O

was	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
suffering	O

must	O
I	O

with	O
such	O
a	O
blow	O

have	O
made	O
an	O
end	O
of	O
her	O

I	O
can	O
hardly	O
recover	O
the	O
horror	O

such	O

gives	O
me	O

though	O
I	O
am	O
sure	O
it	O
ought	O
to	O
encrease	O
our	O
thankfulneſs	O
for	O
finding	O
him	O
as	O
we	O
do	O
,	O
not	O
only	O
alive	O
and	O
in	O
a	O
recovering	O
way	O
,	O
but	O
really	O
free	O
from	O
disorder	O
except	O
that	O
attack	O
on	O
his	O
bowels	O
which	O
they	O
look	O
on	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
saving	O
of	O
his	O

we	O
anchored	O
about	O
12	O

the	O

which	O
he	O
did	O
in	O
so	O
gentle	O

a	O

my	O

all	O

us	O
to	O
